just complete a 2 week stay at the Conrad Hilton so certain aspect of this hotel be excellent Its a 5 star hotel so youd expect high standard so room service room cleaning general cleanlines etc all good however the frustration i feel at the service in the Carraway restaurant and Lobby bar mean i stop eat there after week 1 it be a cros between attempted excellent service i think and Fawlty Towers for those unfamiliar with the program a comedy sketch you have lot of staff all fall over themselves to offer thing but so many fail to deliver get a latte with my breakfast would take a minimum of 2 request and sometimes 3 i do make the observation several time that i have be ask already but if say yes to them mean i may get the drink the yes again please it wasnt just one morning or evening it be on most visit they have no basic discipline in look after certain table the less busy it be the more interruption there would be check on the food and offer additional item there approach be to serve item such as egg to order at breakfast so you may get some oth breakfast item such as hash brown tomato etc Request fry or scramble egg and head back to your table and sit and wait and wait then as the remainder of your breakfast be just about cold the egg would arrive however whilst fresh not necessarily hot Simple way to do it be order your egg sit down hope you may have receive a latte you can drink then when the egg arrive sometimes after a little reminder then get your oth item Simple Same apply when you have a curry and would like naan bread or similar cook fresh whilst your curry cool there be time i be ask how my egg be before they be deliver for those who have manage to keep read it you may think it too long a description Trust me live through it be far more painful so after a week and a number of conversation point out the problem i then stop visit the restaurant and instead get room service Norwegian salmon excellent i stay at the hotel in 2 week

with the flower in the middle of reception and the glas chandelier but that where it stop you be greet by lady in suit not in a Indian sarees which seem strange as youre in India and its local dres the bedroom be nice and spacious but strangely configure its like the bath tub be in the middle of the room and the attention to detail seem to have be missed rush if you have an end room you dont even get a bath tub and the room feel cramped the executive lounge again be nice but miss that homely touch and be not the invite and welcome that you get at oth Conrad hotel the floor to the room smell stale the pool area be nice but the pool be freeze and be more there as an ornament to eat next too then a pool to swim in the sun lounger nee to urgently be replace and nee more by the pool then table and chair its a POOL not a pond with fish in You dont feel very special staying here and you could learn a lot from Pune Conrad a simple hello Mr go a long way overall a nice hotel in a

just amazing Will be back for more room be well maintain and staff be courteous its locate in plush green surrounding and far from the mad crowd Variety of food be also good Service can be a little well and it will then deserve a 5 star rating extremely overrated this place have NOTHING but BAD service they charge quite a bit even for a studio room and the package exclude lunch and dinner amenity such as the activity room be just a small room with table tenni and snooker table and some carrom board Pool be just ok the phone in the room be n t work we have to use our mobile phone and there be hardly any signal in the room to make a call Reception be not too near by from the room that one can always go there to reach out to staff Staff be extremely inefficient they provide WiFi password that work only on 1 device at a time and valid just for 24 hour when they know that our stay be for 2 day and do they provide the password that need to be key in after 24 hour no not until we reach out again the door of the room get lock after 24 hour too and we have to reach out again all this with the mobile phone that hardly have signal Food be very expensive for how mediocre it taste the only meal that be good be breakfast buffet that be include in the package they be blame system for the delay bill generation after each meal Extreme waste of time and money how be such a place even count as one of the luxury stay in the city there be many blog mention this as the top hotel in Bengaluru to stay at i wonder if those author even stay at these place before mention or just do some online research or go by brand name please do not visit and encourage such money scammer that charge for facility but do n t provide them i visit the property over the weekend with family and book villa the room be not upto the mark the curtainz pull for the window be not work the door which open at sit out area be jammed all channel be block in television even after complaint it do n t get resolve the food be average and overpriced the aminitie like TT foosball be present in the area where there be no ventilation or AC and even ball be miss i have be there earlier as well and it use to be a great place few 2 year back now its just not worth earlier they use to have cycle to roam around in the property which be not present Overall experience be not good the property be nice away from the crowd and yet not very far from the city there be ample activity to keep you busy for at least a day we be three family and we stay for a night we enjoy our time play cricket basketball swimming and some indoor game the room be also good we have a mixed opinion on food i personally enjoy their breakfast buffet the lunch buffet on the oth hand have few option and nothing be exceptional this be my second visit to the property and one thing that really disappoint me on both the occasion be the service the front desk on check in could not answer all my question and the property manager be unavailable i try call him but neither do he answer nor do he call back the restaurant staff be also rude and not very helpful A slightly more courtesy would have make the stay even well nevertheless a good weekend getaway if you do n t want to drive far from Bangalore and can ignore the average service Property as such be good Maintenance could be much well Inquire about the outdoor adventure activity and they have quite silly reason for the same being unavailable i be pay for this how can you tell me that some outdoor activity take effort and therefore its not available for the guest unless the number of guest use it be around 8 to 10 you get ta be kid me i be there with my family and they straightaway say that they be not ready to take enough effort to provide the outdoor sport activity they have mention here most IMPORTANT if you be look for a GOOD SERVICE to TENDER to your need you be look at the WRONG PLACE on outskirt of Bangalore it be a decent place to stay Ambience be good food nice greenery pleasing room ok staff be friendly but cleanlines be pretty average Lot s of insect and mosquito around Swimming pool be outdoors and most morning get clean so you ca n t actually use it until 11 am or 12 pm Maintenance be not upto the mark after rain water logging occur at many place and walk around get difficult well upkeep and attention by management be necessary unlike the windflower resort in Mysore and Bandipur the one in Bangalore be an disappointing one Food be quite average Lunch be Rs 800 per person but not worth it Full of greenery but not maintain the attitude of staff be like government office they come only when they want the activity in the resort be additionally charge the good thing be the spa and the service attitude of the staff there Rest of them be just average near to the airport Nothing great apart from this i have a terrible experience stay at this property the resort charge a price on par with a 3 4 star property however the service and facility be not at all worth the price pay Food at the restaurant be very pathetic the staff at the restaurant look lose all the time i find fly and bug in the soup and curry Room service be equally bad Spa and the ambience in the room be average Overall i do not enjoy my stay and i do not intend to visit the resort again do a kid and mom outing with 3 toddler Lovely property compare to some of the oth resort around Bangalore Green with nice spacious room and good set of activity for kid Service be slow though and food quality isnt great too much spice Masala all of us have an upset stomach Breakfast spread be good and food be fine too Villa have 2 room and a large living room pretty spacious for 2 family nice place within bangalore to do a staycation we visit with family and have a villa which come with 2 romom and a living room small property but need more maintenance the breakfast be good specially the item make hot this be a cool place to enjoy your weekend begin from breakfast game pool indoor activity outdoor activity everything be full fun very lush green place with out of City noise i like this place alot i visit here with my wife and 4 year old daughter and we book a villa room Pros room be excellent spacious and well maintain Everything in Room be work AC TV fridge etc and room service be prompt Staff be very Polite and helpful a very decent mix of activity for all age group Cons Poor maintenance they be clearly short on staff Pool be filthy and cover with dust as one oth reviewer mention Open air pool nee constant maintenance no staff present near activity area its a pay service and your staff should be sell it but instead i have to search for people to attend us there be practically no lighting near the Villa room pathway at night and it get a bit creepy not a major issue though Food be average in taste but the staff make up for it by their polite service Breakfast spread be excellent Al a carte option be well Buffet seem a bit expensive though to Summarize this be a good place neither average nor very good it would be very good if you be in a group of family or office for individual family if you be just look to chill around then this resort be suggest if you be look for something High octane look elsewhere this be our second visit to Windflower resort Bangalore First time we go for a day outing with family and friend and this time it be just me and my wife we stay one night in one of the cozy Villa room we have a very peaceful stay the property be good and usually have crowd for day outing mostly corporate folk but the property be big enough hence you wo n t feel crowded the staff be very courteous and responsive to all your request have a nice relaxing time and would love to visit again the food be nice as well we stay for only a night and have food at the restaurant order room service and try the pool what be amazing the room and the bathroom be spacious with a private sit out area the Spa be amazing a must try and ask for Yoganna a very polite and experienced masseur what be not Staff have absolutely no clue about service ask for beer which be about to be serve in a filthy mug the food quality be average Reception or room service dont answer phone on time TV do not work call technician he spend 10 minute in the room and say will fix it we go to the pool have high tea and finish our Spa therapy still no improvement we call up reception again and inform them about TV we be tell the resort be move to digital from analog and will not happen during the day the technician could have atleast inform us order coffee for breakfast which never reach the table Pool be very filthy and the channel cover around the pool be break my wife almost lose balance and be about to get hurt this be a very decent property can do wonder if staff except Spa be train properly the room in the villa section be quaint especially with the transparent sky view ceiling in the bath section add to the charm their serving of the tea and coffee during break time in the meeting be very nicely do on a cart with traditional chai stall offering Good ambience near to the city we have a team out at windflower prakruthi resort last week and most of the service go well Spread of breakfast be very good follow by lunch and hi tea Staff be extremely cooperative thank to Mr Mithun

oth as well Beautiful property with lot of indoor outdoor activity we stay for one night and enjoy a lot the spa be also very good overall we have a wonderful stay Buffet breakfast spread be good and oth food option as well the resort be very near to bangalore airport and can be use for a short visit Location be good Overall maintenance of the resort be good we stay at one night there Food be slightly below expectation overall worth visit once we have a yearly Get together of Engineering Classmates of 1978 batch from JNTU Ananthapur we spend an overnight here little away from the city but well connected Plenty of Coconut also oth tree make it green but the green gras be not much no privacy for swimming we do not try it as it be pretty cold Food be good with a variety of dish but dessert be not much the serve be from split location miss few Conference room be OK Bed room be OK except the bathroom be not provide with a slide glas bath door result in wet bathroom floor Adequate parking but do not park under a coconut tree the fall coconut can break the glas overall our stay meet be pleasant go along with a group of family friend and stay at the Windflower Prakruthi for a night like the experience and will highly recommend Let me get down to the pro and con so that you can make up your mind whether to pick this resort over another Pros not too far from Bangalore close to International Airport quality of approach road be good it be a quiet place and there be a feel of be close to nature there be activity for both adult and child room be spacious and can easily accommodate a family of 4 room be clean properly maintain and have all modern amenity Quality of food be very good Staff at the hotel be courteous Quality place for leisurely outing with family and friend consider its proximity to Bangalore and quality of resort the room tariff be reasonable their sale team be prompt and cooperative so room reservation for a big group be not a hassle Cons the buffet spread be limited so if you be in a mood to binge then you may be a tad disappointed some of their staff member seem less focused especially those deal with high tea could be fatigue or something but not expect in a resort such as these Overall i be impressed with the resort and will highly recommend if you be look for a place for weekend getaway with friend and family near Bangalore not much of drive require to reach here yet you get a feeling of be surround by nature Everyone like the place no one in the group complain if you get a good room tariff then go for it be here for Office Day outing food be ok some basic sport activity like Badminton Pool Cricket fuseball be break simple Swimming pool no water sprort or adventure sport not for Office Day outing be here for a team out on a Saturday Lunch spread as be good each team be allot space for their activity which be a good thing since it get crowd High tea be just ok overall a good place a very peaceful weekend retreat at a well maintain decent sized property with amazing food and great service be the summary of my opinion the place be well design and maintain breakfast spread have lot of option and be very flavorful attendant be warm and friendly the spa be clean and well staffed room be tastefully design and maintain i stay in a cottage which provide good privacy and a quite environment the only negative thing i face be lack of hot water which they could not fix despite multiple attempt until i check out despite that i be pretty sure that i will return there sometime for another weekend in the future P S there be some outdoor game option which i do not personally try but see other do and the pool look clean too we stay as a group of 4 family over a weekend not very far from city but totally away from the city sound only exception be the sound of the flight approach KIAL Good facility nice food great staff we have a good time i visit Windflower Resort Bangalore during December for 3 day its a beautiful property hide away from the hustle bustle of Bangalore city but yet only 1 hour drive the staff at reception be very warm and welcoming and the check in proces be pretty quick we book a cottage which be very well furnished and well maintain there be a lot of fun activity that you can participate in like Trampoline ATV ride hire a cycle etc which make the stay much more enjoyable the swim pool for both adult and kid be well maintain there be a kid play area which my kid love the most the food overall be good and the staff be very helpful i would like to especially mention Virabhadra one of the staff work at the restaurant he be extremely helpful and look after us well every time we visit the dinning area overall i m extremely happy with my stay at the resort and would recommend it to anyone look out for a peaceful gateway in Bangalore for a couple of day this resort be awesome in each and every aspect especially when it come to food it be good when it come to stay and luxury it be admirable and when it come to service it be on the top i be very much impressed with each and every service and staff and i will recommend to other we want something close to the airport as we be transit in and out of Bangalore the hotel be not far in a quiet place its very green and the villa be spacious the breakfast be very good and they be kind enough to get it go a bit earlier than their time of 07 30 hr while it be easy to get to the hotel from the airport by ub get to the airport need a hire cab as uber be not available but the hotel have this cover we the team go for 2 day corp meet and stay in this resort well maintain resort i must say lot of facility to be engage with like paintball archery cricket football basketball swimming pool TT pool

enjoy cycling and ches i think it be the only resort which have kid size ches board i and my son enjoy play it Day out price be a bit costly than oth resort but worth the money i be surprised why this place have 4 rating it deserve a 1 star rating or even low be there on Saturday afternoon for a day out with freind the resort be not so big its a small resort the swimming pool be damn dirty and the water purifier be also not work so you wo nt feel like jumbe into fhe pool Most of the outdoor activity be chargeable but the package include all the outdoor activity come to the buffet it be the most disgusting and tasteless food i ever have the place where the bueffet be place be inside a tent and it be very hot inside it and there be fly all over the eat area which make fhe buffet even more unhygienic we pay Rs1300 per person and it be absolutely not worth it my recommendation to all that dont go by picture and rating this place be not worth it there be many good resort in Bangalore we go for a team out from our company to this resort the food be average and not many activity available i feel the service and the overall stay be well in oth Windflower resort Food and activity could improve we two family take 4 room and stay for 2 night we have have very good experience in a couple of oth Windflower property we find Prakruthi resort also keep up to the standard Calm peaceful and green surrounding 4km inside from the airport Bellary road one the first day as we arrive there be loud music for day package group we be worried but rest of the time it be quiet the entire property be tastefully design nicely light up in the night very good upkeep Professional and friendly staff the room we take suite room be big luxurious and very well appoint very good bed good fitting in the

Breakfast buffet be so generous an eden near to the airport the place be quite good with few outdoor indoor game and lot of open space Good for a Weekend get away for family and couple it would be best enjoy if travel in a small group Food be good and they have a good variety although the breakfast spread can be limit i m not sure if that be because we go on a Sunday and there be only 7 family in the Whole Resort room be good or fine base on the charge they take we have issue with AC though which the hotel electrician could n t resolve properly the bathroom have a broken hand shower but there be no issue with run hot water or oth facility Note if you be plan to travel with rent or car service provider vehicle you may face issue as it be near to Airport and cab service may not be able to provide you cab there its well to keep the vehicle with you it be our 6th anniversary and 1st one with our 1 year old since i stay in Bangalore and be look for a nearby getaway my review may be focusse from that point its a beautiful resort nicely tuck away before the Bangalore airport we just be look for a peaceful and quiet time and to chill out with good food and this be exactly what we find we book the studio room it be clean and keep well also the front area have enough space for my toddler to crawl around the balcony be awesome overlook a small garden the only small problem be relate to bee which be why the review miss a 5 star come the service it be awesome very friendly staff and they entertain all our need with a smile the food be tasty and the lunch buffet spread be excellent and the breakfast buffet be fantastic my kid enjoy spend time gaze at the fish tank swan and turkey the holiday give a nice relaxed feel the be a lot of activity for people to enjoy around the resort overall a nice and relaxed holiday what not to like quite well maintain clean room Great service Fabulous food rope activity be pretty good too ATV ride be also just fine rest of the amenity can be improve overall a good weekend spend Excellent food probably the good breakfast i have have as far as an buffet be concern very clean room Good spacious interior Friendly staff Economical a little in the interior from the main road which be a boon at time Perfect for short trip i d say they have good space for arrange team outing provide option of activity but only few activity be worth of that price Pros Food be good big dining area Good area for play we enjoy human soccer and ATV ride Cons Indoor game space be very small only one pool table and a TT table with carrom and foosball outside Indoor room moreover they be keep their music system and oth stuff in that room look like a storage room not comfortable to play there Swimming pool be small and change room be not prop only one room for change cloth and very small no prop management here Activities ATV ride Archery Paintball etc Human soccer Peaceful resort with quality guest make our stay very soothing enjoy swim pool hand ball with the team it be fun enjoy terrain biking and the nature all through the resort with different specie of bird Amazing food and spread a place to enjoy week end with family and friend reasonably price Prompt service stay more comfortable we have book this resort for team out for a day 15 head count from the time we enter no one to greet us or bother to ask who we be we do Breakfast there Food be OK not great all Plastic chair and plate Dirty no activity as they mention they say Indoor activity not even 6 people can play there so small they have very small pool for adult look like baby pool Broken kid play zone they have some Rope activity and cycling Paint ball all be charge way too high Say for Rope activity per person Rs400 so as Paint ball we felt that s too costly Team spirit be go down see nothing there to play and enjoy finally we see a small ground where we think at least we play cricket no one in the sport room with all break bat wicket ball we collect the same and leave for play we play for 30 to 40 min then we think let play volley ball not even single ball there no one to help us when ask manager we do not have now they be very rude and do not care much that s it we decide to leave right then they start ask for Breakfast Rs450 Tax for that bland food we leave settle everything before 12 30 such a disappointing place for a Day out we immidiately leave for oth resort which be close by while Settling Bill hear someone else who stay there too be not Happy anyways i do not want to comment on that when Charge a away too much than normal resort they should have facility to accommodate people and engage them never ever go to visit this place we have go for team out to windflower resort on Bangalore outskirt Resort be nice and have quite few good amenity for team building like paintball shooting some team spirt you can enjoy Food soread be limited but taste good for lunch buffet Service of staff be not great and especially at front desk one important point in today digital time in India especially in Bengaluru they dont accept payment through paytm bhim bharatQR or any oth app they only except master or visa card and on Amex card they be charge 4 extra which i have to pay as ffrom corporate amex be very common pmo finministy rbi folk should look into this entity cuz its not buisnes freindly and not give fair price to customer See the below pic for extra charge Suggestion we should avoid these type of business who charge extra on digital or card payment so they come to thier knee or chage thier practice Good part be they chrge that with proud and arrogance like it thier right we be a family of 4 include 2 kid we stay in the suite it be a wonderful experience Key point 1 the room be neat with a comfortable bed and 2 tv the green view from the room be wonderful 2 the bathroom be very clean even have a private extra shower in the open 3 Food be delicious the free breakfast and high tea be good Lot of open space to enjoy the tea 4 Enough green gras for kid to run and play also a nice swimming pool game bicycle lot of greenery and even some swan 5 Staff be very courteous try their good to please all in all if you re look for a nice relaxing time to refresh yourself away from the city Windflower wo n t disappoint Go for it it have be give a natural look but be very haphazard setup the room be dirty Full of cobweb Poor light dingy the service quality be very poor the cup be remove for washing but be not replace glass for water meet the same fate the cupboard provide be too small for a couple the furniture be too old and damaged the WiFi do not work it be more a showpiece room be quite fine Lot of greenery and peace you can have wonderful morning walk in the resort it be quite

good stay Wifi suck and signal be weak so you be not connect it be a nice property well maintain visit with family and stay over at suite Hospitality be good at the main reception area include the food court food option be good and tasty include the live counter Bar option be limited and could find only 2 variety of beer activity and the personnel handle them be hospitable enough Spa facility be fine Few cycle be available which be useful to go around the property Room interior decor be good the reason for 3 rating be the unavailability of hot water throughout evening and morning have to inform multiple time to the reception area but still the response time leave a lot to be desire finally after many try they inform that they will send hot water only to send luke warm or warm water at best this aspect of maintenance could be greatly improve the property be spacious and can be maintain even well overall a good place to stay and would nee some minor correction Have visit after last release along with the team it be wonderful and quite eventful because every team member have their own share of activity both indoor and outdoor Zorbing be the good out of the lot this place be great for family with child the luxurious landscape be very well maintain and food be also quite good room and housekeep MG could be slightly manage better overall an enjoyable couple of day be spend by us the Windflower Resorts Spa be a good property close by to the Bangalore airport its more of a family and corporate crowd resort which have enough activity and space for them to conduct two minus be the noise of cricket match near our room where some function be go on with loud music and disturbance and any service call to house keeping or room service need two reminder as mostly with one call it

activity and people follow up or guidance be less Indoor game be limited and size of the room be very small Food be good for breakfast lunch be ok Swimming pool be crowd but ok Summer day outing could have be fun but we spend much time sit in the lawn stay at this resort on a weekend the property be good with nice clean cottage room the swimming pool be generally crowd but you can have a good time nonetheless you can do cycling zip lining and a few oth adventurous outdoor activity indoor game room be rather small though you have foosball a TT table and a carrom i like the food they give the dinner and breakfast buffet be great overall a nice place to go if you nee a quick break from the city hustle to begin with we have to call the resort a number of time before we get detail of the deal LAZY and bad customer service Mithun the person we be talk to keep tell us he will call back but clearly do n t find the time Anyway finally when it be all do a bunch of us girl go to spend a day at the resort most disappointing to say the least there be no one to tell us what be include as a part of the deal the service be lazy and annoying no one have a clue of what be happen and if that be n t bad enough the pool could have give one any number of skin disease cloudy water and the filthy of change area Full of hair all over Wait there be more the food be serve cold in the most unattractive read ugly banquet hall with plastic chair like a cheap wedding do no one care and no one bother to be of service 1400 buck what a waste if you be look for a place to relax this be nt the place it will make you MAD with anger Windflower Prakruthi you nee to seriously shut down or up your game thing that we like at the resort 1 Indoor game room with prop facility all the game accessory be available and none of the stuff be miss eg pool ball carrom coin 2 Adult Pool be a maintain one kid pool be slightly small 3 Friendly staff 4 Nice buffet spread for lunch 5 Clean and green surround this be an excellent place to stay especially for your weekend simply awesome place to stay with family and friend the Food and Services be awesome our group enjoy alot thank Team for treat us special the hotel be locate some 25 minute drive time from the Bangalore airport and appear to be the starting point of many tour cover the southern part of India my wife a friend and i spend one night at this hotel at the beginning of our tour to the Mysore Nilgiri and Ooty area the room be big with comfortable bed modern bath room air condition excellent free WiFi and multiple language tv program the hotel be locate in the middle of a forest area and offer lot of thing to do for adult as well as kid the restaurant offer authentic Indian and Asian food we really like the hospitality and food be good Clean room be here in month of April last year 1 thing i do nt like be that there be a movie shoot go on and preference be give to them and 2 time the restaurant be crowd with the film crew member overall a good resort near Bangalore airport Good accessibility through the highway that connect to the airport the place be well maintain but i feel the swim pool be little small and it be pretty hot in our dining area during lunch Food quality have deteriorate from the last time i visit a couple of year back there be few good activity provide by the resort but a little expensive enjoy the day outing the place serve a good buffet lunch and have fantastic ambience to relax Do ensure to call up and check with the restaurant for availability as there be corporate event plan too on the whole not a bad option not very far from the airport however it recommend to go with a private transport as the place be quite inside from the main road we have a beautiful time resort the Sunday Buffet Spread be Awesome thank to Rajesh TG GM Sales Resort GM Mr Rao and F B Manager Sanal for make our trip a memorable one landscape be great and its a great place for a family get together s Last Friday Morning go to this resort for the second time with my office colleague fori a day outing first of all what i notice from the ambiance be that the owner of this property be behind money rather than maintain the property well as per the reputation what it suppose to be Pros 1 Good Location 2 Good Pool 3 Nice front desk people Cons 1 Food Quality maybe because it serve as part of the package all the people Staff in the area where they be serve food Near to the park area be all sob faced no professionalism no smile really not good and do n t feel like ask anything from them my colleague ask for a spoon and the staff who be present there just wink the way where the spoon be keep very bad way of handle a customer 2 Wooden work be go on carpenter keep their accessory in the walk pathway in most of the place which no customer feel good 3 cleanlines not maintain across the resort maybe because of the crowd 4 Ice Cubes in Dust Bin a staff carry ice cube in a plastic dust bin do not seriously look good for any customer even though you be serve alcohol near to the pool area please take care of these thing 5 bill related issue in the Bar they have a bar and there be some 5 6 customer we order a mock tail and the bar tender do n t even listen to us even after call him multiple time and bad part be that when ever he sell anything for get the money through Card he be leave the bar counter and head towards the reception area to acces the POS machine and all oth customer be sit idle without be handle by any oth person absolutely Ridiculous Hope you people will accept the drawback and try to work on these thing to get everything in the right path the resort have a quite beautiful and calm ambiance i find it really soothing and great getaway from the city hustle its definitely a place where you would like to visit multiple time some point which i would like to be improve be 1 Evening snack can be improve option in tea would be definitely one such thing like i ask for a ginger tea but could get only the regular one 2 the staff could ask customer preference while take order if they like it less oily or more spicy the pakora order by us be quite oily though i do n t give a feedback i love that later when i come for dinner the staff come and ask the reason why i do n t have it i feel good about this proactive approach and definitely feel the extra effort they put in the dinner we order 3 The badminton court need to be do in wood or cement the shuttle be low quality and be not even carry to the oth person as the court be open the court with small gravel could easily cause an injury during play an indoor badminton court could be the good 4 expect a bath tub this have become a prime choice for us to spend our marriage anniversary we do the same last year love it thus go back again the good thing be this be one of the rare occasion where i have feel a resort have actually get well a year on Last year the pool be under maintenance but now it be pristine blue and fully operational Food quality have actually get well this time we opt for a villa but to be hon a studio or a suite would have be almost equally good WiFi be inconsistent and the AC remote be not work properly otherwise everything go else be spot on thank again for arrange for a nice chocolate cake for the occasion my kid enjoy the place a lot as well overall definitely my top pick for resort in the neighbouring Bangalore area good experience while stay for a night in windflower resort we have book suite and it be well maintenance and clean with outdoor garden this will make more environment friendly atmosphere Staff be so good with prop respond in time regard food it slight expensive but very good in taste it not so economical in lunch and dinner but buffet be available and both kind of food Veg and Non Veg available its have more oth facility available like conference room and lunch hall and out door activity we love the place its do tastefully and the entire resort have beautiful nature Its a bit expensive but its worth go there to unwind from the city life the villa cottage be lovely and they have beautiful stone bathroom with an transparent ceiling so you can look at nature while you shower Great experience me and my cousin plan a get together in this resort for a day out we book the day out package for Breakfast Lunch Hi Tea be be apt for us consider the activity and cuisine that fit all we youngster and kid the drive to the resort itself be beautiful on the outskirt easy to get lose hence keep Google Maps as your companion it be a good 5kms off the International

price and the room be clean and tidy it seem a little far out from Bangalore but ok for short visit we visit this Windflower Prakruthi resort on last weekend the resort quality hygiene be top clas Pros Good Approach road 40kms from city Excellent room infrastructure lenin quality too good Spread over large area activity be segregate and spacious Swimming pool be nice Good indoor game Cons due to flat tyre our checkin get delay by almost 2 hour expect a call from resort about the delay but no one call so by the time we reach the resort the receptionist inform that the lunch be close just before 15mins and we can not help much on this TV do nt work the maintenance ppl also take long time to fix Food be on expensive side r 900 exclude tax per person Outdoor activity be costly Its our second visit to Prakruthi so be go to start with my concern from last time and see whether management have work on it Food be something that i have issue last time this time food and service awesome Villa room more or less same interior look very old now Time for management to change the mattres its fully do it kind of sink in to your weight last time i want to them fix the electric bathroom room freshener be ground floor open type bathroom and no exhaust fan its something require but gues what no exhaust fan seal window and electric freshener remove with oth action activity move to token system now it doesnt look like a resort feel its more like hotel and these activity be different to me some management issue have be sort out with this token system guest experience have be compromise Spa which i cherish last time but kind of let down this time four hand become two hand but oil remain the same for four hand so the time hand move from one side to the oth side oil will become cold and sticky to your body Spa experience have come down from extraordinary to average so whats the advantage then very near to Bangalore thats the only thing i can say now Will be there for next Deepavali or may be before meanwhile hope resort improve and bre back the experience rather just provide shelter and food we book a ground floor room and it have a balcony face the garden which be awesome for a glas of wine while the kid watch TV Room and bathroom be huge and it have a n outdoor shower area as well Good breakfast buffet spread real good Quality of food i gues could be improve but overall a great place for a quick getaway Luxurious as with oth WF hotel the activity for kid take the cake my son enjoy the rope activity there be also archery and a good pool Will go again we have a family get together at the Windflower Prakruthi resort and it be a lovely experience while the property itself be not much to speak of they have make good use of the space available to them they have all basic facility and anything extra will be pay and use they have activity like Human soccer quad biking rope walking etc but you have to pay extra for these weekend can get crowded and you may end up have to wait a long time to be able to use these the room be lovely and you feel close to nature there really be no difference between the studio room and the suite Studio room be all on the first floor and suite on the ground floor the food be wonderful and the chef be a delight he give personal attention to kid and on a particularly cranky day for my little daughter they specially make whatever she ask for i be actually able to relax and have a good time throughout Management be too poor they take the booking and when you be about to visit the place they just tell the booking confirmation be not make Mode of communication be too bad when ask why the booking be not do management just laugh at you and tell we hav not do any confirmation even when we have the confirmation mail with us Would not want to give a star because they do nt even deserve terrible rating its below that this be not a review for a stay at the resort what we have be a day out from our office we be a team of 16 and have book a day outing at Windflower which include lunch hi tea and indoor and outdoor sport when we reach there we find that outdoor be only a small area where you can play some cricket a similar area to lie football and a not so well maintain badminton court all of which be waterlogge with the rain in the previous day Indoor game be a TT table a pool table a carrom table and a fusball table all pack into a room the size of a bedroom so that no one have place to stand and do anything there there be many oth activity at the property quad bike segway adventure climbing but all of them be charge separately and expensive they also have some kid play area which we do n t use since this be an office outing the lunch have a good spread and a live counter for some item the dish be also quite good while we be originally plan to stay at the resort till 6 pm since there be nothing to do there be plan to finish high tea and leave by 3 45 but the staff quite rudely refuse to give us team 15 minute early instead of 4 pm then we talk to the chef and he agree to have it ready by 3 45 Overall this be quite a bad experience and it feel we really pay all the money for a lunch and hi tea the most perfect weekend getaway in Bangalore which be fun for the couple and the kid Food and stay be awesome and would want you to go again to the resort the pool be clean there be greenery play area for kid badminton court for the adult Staff be courteous and be impressive with it management skill room be superbly locate with amazing view be here for day outing organise by our Bangalore office team Boring place as only swimming be free in our package Everything other adventure activity be charge extra and we have to wait as the wheel need to be fix toilet near swim pool poorly maintain and stinking Buffet spread not worth for day out look like part of resort facility be renovate Rest be very old and not even clean mosquito problem too None of us enjoy Lovely place with good quality food and stay visite second time and every one have a great time Quite and peaceful weekend spend and try their spa facility its relaxing only con be the food ia little expensive and we end up pay more for food than stay i be look for a luxury resort within city limit for a day outing with my family and finally pick Windflower Prakruthi after read positive review here on TripAdvisor book the package which include Breakfast Lunch and Hi Tea through Thrillophilia Pros 1 the property be beautiful spacious and well keep locate far away from the hustle and bustle of the city this can be an ideal choice if you really want to disconnect the network connectivity issue can be a blessing in disguise for someone who do n t want to be disturbed and unwind 2 food serve be really delicious and have a good amount of variety to offer 3 Staff be very polite and courteous 4 nice and clean swimming pool 5 Quiet a few outdoor activity option be available though they do come at an extra price Cons 1 find a disconnect among the staff and there be lack of coordination although we have receive a confirmation of our booking well in advance our name be not present in the list of guest which be suppose to be arrive for the Day Outing on that particular day there be lack of communication which result in we be ask for our booking vouch every time we move spot 2 the restroom be dirty and stinking the change room near the swimming pool be in poor shape and very unhygienic do not expect such negligence from a property of such repute i have be there for day out with team after struggle to reach their reservation person apparently no network in side Resort and it kind off cut off from city anyway place be good they have maintain lawn and outside area well Dining hall and pool area be also well maintain but common washroom near dining hall and swimming pool be expect to be more clean and not stinking swim pool depth be varied from 3 foot deep to six foot without any bifurcation which be dangerous i request them to put rope as mark to differentiate between different area of pool with different depth there be not many activity in the default package of day outing if team be not play cricket and swimming pool not much to do unless you take adventure activity by pay extra Indoor game be in congested be may be Carom and foose ball table can be accommodate in oth room would make it comfortable come to food and hospitality we reach their early before 9 00 AM and receive well by staff there and breakfast spread be good with Indian and Continental mix along with live counter for paratha poori dosa and omlettle Lassi and vegetable juice be good along with boil egg and sausage for health conscious and non veg love people Taste and presentation of food be good Lunch be good and Chicken Tikka from Live counter and Biryani be must try there they just taste awesome on veg side Daal rice and Kofte curry be good but not much from live counter you can try out some chaat also as per your taste include dahi vada deeset be also great Maalpua with Rbari and Banana pudding be perefct in taste we do not try oth pay advanture activity but enjoy the day with awesome food and indoor game and play cricket i organize a family day event for my company in Windflower prakruthi Bangalore Place be beautiful peaceful and spacious with lot of greenery around we stay in villa cottage which be good the resort be understaffed every check in and checkout be take lot of time after 1 hour of follow up with front desk i get the room allot one of the room allot be not clean team do not check before hand over the key they have good buffet with live counter as it be rain the room service guy be efficient in deliver the food which be order the staff be dedicate to addres the issue but nee to be more efficient overall i would say it be good but not great we visit the property on 19th August and really like the environment and facility provide the staff be very professional in their approach and we have a very good time we go for A la carte and the food server be very good the good part be you seldom get range in your mobile so you can spend quality time undisturbed they do provide WiFi you may consider service the cycle as i find few to be in very bad condition overall we have a very good time the Windflower Prakruthi in Bangalore be one such establishment that have consistently astound me with its unmatched hospitality deliver everything you would expect and more from a luxury Resort and Spa we travel as a family include my 7 month infant daughter for a leisure weekend we book through Yatra Check in be smooth even though be Saturday it be crowd have spend great moment here really love the resort Pros good part be hospitality Staff be well courteous and take good care of their guest Resort be aptly staff and all be helpful and well train Restaurant be great one would expect at a resort stature of Windflower Buffet spread be royal but the crux be its all very yummy moderately spicy and oily to cater to all taste and health Dining be probably the good part of WF Prakruthi from royal buffet to evening snack everything be perfect with top up of excellent service though not a very big area resort premise be well maintain its truly nature Prakruthi with lot of green vegetation tree around which feel like a hill station especially for Villa area Parking be sufficient and centrally locate near to area like reception restaurant cottage suite Open bathroom concept be really wonderful and we really enjoy it room be descent in size and infrastructure be good one should expect at 4 star property Most infrastructure in Windflower prakruthi be well maintain like ride furniture reception etc Villa area have beautiful landscaping and tall tree one would indeed engulf in nature Cons Villa room interior not upto the mark aesthetic be dull or non existent TV and Bed size be small while room exterior be great interior need a little makeover though all require basic like electric kettle refrigerator AC be provide and work Lighting in common area outside and pathway need to be improve Overall Windflower prakruthi have be an excellent place for family couple and friend to find solace in nature enjoy great dining and refresh Big thump up for the for the exceptional hospitality and great dining for its guest i have be there for conference cum training the location of the property be convenient at the same time away from traffic and general congestion lot of outdoor sport facility include a beautiful

Great Coordination Good Food Awesome Property Great Experience we visit this place as a family of 5 for a weekend break love the location accommodation villa activity on the property Staff be very cordial and attentive Accommodation be clean food be good especially the Indian food the hot water in the room probably come from solar heater as there be no hot water available after 6 pm though the activity have to be pay for separately it be good and there be enough to keep you engage for a day overall we have an enjoyable stay we have be for night stay and the studio room be very good it be clean and the view from balcony be something to remember it be spacious and we get on the first floor the bathroom be good too the food have a good range of variety both in lunch and breakfast with quality this be the good part Swimming pool be well maintain unlike in the other comment visit Windflower during a company staff retreat its a fairly satisfactory place with reasonably nice landscaping clean and large room decent food courteous staff and a full range of activity there be nothing particularly bad or dislikeable about the place but i be n t too happy about the lack of lighting after dark the extremely poor wifi the lack of connectivity to the city and their tendency to host multiple group in parallel just finish a great Reunion at Prakruthi Windflower Resorts with 65 friend and family it be make great in all way great Ambience nature beauty clean environment beautiful room both suite room and cottage this entire 2 day event be make successful by the wonderful staff to start with Booking sale executive prashanth reception desk Anand and Khiatan Manager Shankar who listen to all the detailed requirement and make sure all arrangement be do accord to our

it be not a very big room the lunch and dinner be not include we have to order by pay extra the quality of food be excellent Breakfast be very good activity such as paintball ATV and zorbing be extra cost Reason i give three star and not four be because of the unavailability of hot water in the room we have to wait for 30 min for someone to try and fix which ultimately do nt happen at last we have to ask housekeeping to get hot water from outside in a bucket this remind me of 100 r room stay in tirupati i meet another person in the reception who too complain about hot water for a place which charge so much this episode be pathetic conduct a 3 day conference for around 70 people from across the country at Windflower Prakruthi Bangalore receive amazing response from each and every

the weekend and overall it a peaceful place where you feel away from the hustle and bustle of city but the place be not far away from city close to airport the experience be comfortable and here be what i like dislike about the place the villa cottage be very well maintaned and spacious enough for our group of 3 adult and 1 kid they have maintain the greenery well and also the you can take stroll inside the place and feel close to the nature Complimentary buffet breakfast be very delicious and they have lot of option include the live counter Buffet dinner be also very tasty and with diverse option and price at 750 i have read in some oth review that the swimming pool be not very clean but we find it clean enough may depend upon the maintenance cycle Spa service offer at the place be a bit pricey the price mention in the menu be exclusive of taxis though the person do massage be very polite and professional the comfort level may be improve a bit May they should focu a bit more on the hygiene factor specially when serve to guest in the open space one can find lot of fly in the otherwise tasty cake be serve during complimentary high tea one idea can be to have these arrange inside the dining hall and people can take it out near the swimming pool if they wish to do so overall i love the experience and would like to visit sometime again in the future we want to take a short weekend break n decide to stay at wildflower prakruthi very close to city lush green atmosphere clean awesome food they have a wide spread for breakfast well maintain garden play area n pool

drive from North Bangalore with good acces when my husband and i stay over at Windflower i be heavily pregnant and want to stay someplace away from the city centre but not so out of the way that i could n t reach a hospital or a doctor quickly the location of this resort be perfect in that respect the website could be a little more informative for example i have to call the resort to understand how the different room type differ from each oth besides their rate per day as this information be no where on the website there be a slight problem with our room when we first arrive but they assign us a different room right away and without any hassle the staff be courteous friendly and professional across the resort be it reception housekeeping restaurant game area or spa the suite be spacious and the bed very comfortable the bathroom be beautiful and well stocked the suite open to a man make water body on the inside which be a nice touch and though there be n t too much leg room it nice to sit there if the weather be not too warm the ground be a beautiful mix of natural growth and curated greenery and make for very pleasant walk Breakfast be complementary in our package and include a wide variety of item both Indian and Continental with a couple of live counter as well the food be delicious at all our meal the dining area have both indoor and semi outdoor dining option there be a lot of option for recreation include archery and rope walkway ATV arena besides the usual thing like badminton TT swimming pool etc for a day s stay there be a small fee for thing like archery but it be complementary for a longer stay the spa be a little pricey which i suppose be to be expect at a place like this but i do come out feel like it be worth every rupee Overall i find the stay very pleasant and relaxing and would definitely recommend the place to other the property be quite good but possibly due to off season the maintenance be not up to mark we be invite a wedding and stay for 02 day the stay be comfortable and arrangement be very good thanak to our host nice room and food enjoy the rain shower concept in room Villas have a thoughful sit out outside amidst nature good play activity for kid the actual indoor game room be very small though Buffet be good but spread can be well very nice place lot of option to keep the team engage for the day Buffet quality be good and

two LCD tv now come to food spread be good but variety be less the kid can enjoy the activity the resort have to offer you can play football or cricket at the resort nicely maintain internal road to cycle overall good stay with family well maintain property away from the city Perfect for a summer getaway the food be decent and the staff be extremely courteous definitely worth the money the swimming pool be clean and the surrounding have be maintain well if day outing group be there it can get a bit noisy that the only drawback we find with this place its a good place for a day or two big property can be maintain in a well fashion food be not great service be average no help for luggage to and from room the activity be not great be summer season should be good during rain winter Windflower Bangalore be a pleasant surprise we go there for the weekend and have a lovely stay Spa be good the food be good and the room be neat clean we take a nice morning walk look around the property and venture into some vegetable garden and mango tree too be a nice break from the city only problem be no English entertainment or movie channel on TV have go here to celebrate my birthday

spread and taste be also very good the resort as such be very good we have be here last week to celebrate our wedding anniversary i have call the previous day to check if the buffet for dinner and lunch be available on all the day and i be tell that yes its available when i check in i be tell only a la carte be available then it happen to be there be a film shoot go on and the whole place be noisy and crowded the management could have mention over the call that there be a film shoot go on i would have think of cancel the booking during dinner the restaurant be occupy for film shooting and we be tell to sit outside near the Bar area kindly in future if you have some movie shooting do mention the guest in advance so that we can plan accordingly we be a bit disappointed because be ever we go the movie shoot guy be not allow and be ask us to come later either near the swimming pool or the lawn area the Breakfast be awesome the resort be a good place for a day visit with the intention of team build or family gathering the food spread be good and tasty the whole place be very serene with good garden and tree the conference room facility be not good with people walk outside and frequent power breakup i stay for 1 night on cottage at 1st floor Privacy be a real issue as the balcony be real close to neighbouring cottage also come to know from colleague that the rest room of ground floor cottage have serious privacy issue so basically i consider these drawback as architectural flaw with the cottage one thing that must be appreciate be the friendly and eagernes to provide good service my elderly mother and i spend 3 night at the Bangalore Resort i have to say i be pleasantly surprised we have a Cottage the whole place be very clean and the staff be really good i wish i could remember all the name but Hostess Ayesha Veerbadra Murthy of Bistro and Malli Chandana and Santosh Kumar at the Spa be particularly helpful the reception staff also be quick to help with bag and with my mother who walk with the help of a cane Food be great and i love the pool even though i be only able to use it once if i would like one thing change maybe a big selection at the bar for someone live in the din and bustle of city life this be the perfect escape haven to rejuvenate your sense and feel absolutely relaxed amidst nature and it essence the place be very well maintain the room be clean and bright Food be fabulous price be decent the staff be very friendly and courteous and i could just go on and on it really a perfect break from the mundane the perfect get away to

property be lovely and be perfect for relax and get away from the hustle of Bangalore city however the food be thoroughly disappointing there be mainly north Indian dish all of which either lack flavour or have too much masala we enjoy our stay despite that thank to the nice facility they have an excellent spa and a nice swimming pool as well visit Windflower Prakruthi with the family for a 2 day break Nice place Check in be smooth inspite of rush we have a broken curtain in our villa which be attend to immediately Food be good so be the snack but with only one restaurant it can be limit

due to distance attraction they have Swimming Pool Dining Area Banquet Hall huge Play Ground miss they do n t have much option for sport the Playground be big but not much sport equipment for Swimming

resort sometimes be overrun by people come in for a day outing their number and boisterousness can overwhelm the resident during the day especially in the dining area to Watch out for if you be go to stay for a long duration more than 3 day please take your favorite comfort food chocolate cookie drink with you also take along entertainment material there be no organize entertainment after sunset there be no decent shop for more than 10 km around the hotel so you may end up drive back to Bangalore to get your stuff we go only to explore the property and to have a an evening snack n coffee outdoors with nature the property be spread over a large area and seem to be largely serve the corporate off site group the build up part of the property be well maintain but the periphery have be leave unattended either by choice or default it do not appear to attract many footfall like us for which it have the potential the restaurant be partially in the verandah overlook the gardens good ambiance Good place to come for a breakfast or lunch buffet Do not expect the wait staff to be polish and well train we go there for a large busines conference it be excellent the conference room facility be neatly manage we be 50 people approx food be excellent very big spread both regional and global cuicine all deliver hot and tasty the barbecue in the evening at the lawn make it memorable in general the place look rich and can be use for official and personal getaway not very far from bangalore 15 min from hebbal too good and very hospitable staff special mention to ayesha who manage our conference we go to windflower for a day when we want to spend time with friend we be 4 family and enjoy our time there the restaurant be really good and be keep be comfortable with all our request s as there be 6 child along Chief Vikas and his coulic be courteous and help us we even carry our food from there when we be leave the room be clean and nice activity to spend couple of day do not try the spa but rate be reasonable we visit in 2015 end this be one of the most basic windflower property i ve be to room and all be nice but overall very average when you look at the ambiance and amminitie it be good for 1 day outing lot of adventure sport type of activity wow Lovely place to take a trip away from the city and spend a night or two over the weekend Food and ambience be good too we have our 8 month old with us the staff and kitchen team go beyond to make sure her food be well prepared and serve in time a big shout out to Chef Vikash for help us with the baby food we book the resort for multiple date Everything from the food to hospitality to ambience be just great it a great escapade for relaxation and conduct event i would like to make a special mention of the chef Vikash who will always suprise you with his culinary talent the food be a big USP of the place thank to the chef and the management we have conduct multiple Out Bound Programs at the resort every stay have be more than perfect the staff have be extremely supportive some people who stand out include Chef Vikash Mr Anand at the Reception and Mr Manoj from F B they have play a key role in help myself and the team for create an exceptional experience for all our participant we go for a family day outing 3 family in total and have a bad experience on arrival the first thing we feel be the cleanlines of the place be nowhere close to where it should be especially for a brand name Windflower very badly maintain eat area so call Pavilion it be an open hall with plastic chair for seating the dinning area for residential guest be really nice and posh wonder why the discrimination Food be really bad Nothing taste good Limited spread of buffet no hot food be serve the bar have no cold juice or lemon wedge for a drink this place have lot of scope for improvement the approach road be not good at all it be not worth the money they charge for a day outing which be r 1200 per person the game like quadrabike zorbing etc we have to pay for it should come free with the package the pool be dirty look like it be under renovation the only plus point go to greenery around the place Awesome place for a corporate team outing Dedicated staff like Mr Anand Mr Manoj Pavan and other make the outing memorable Special thank to Mr Vikash bhatt the chef for the amazing delicacy Good place for both day outing and overnight stay just back from a short retreat at this property Windflower Prakruthi be about an hour s drive from the centre of Bengaluru pretty close to the Airport but very strategically locate in a pretty secluded and serene location this make the property extremely viable and an attractive proposition for folk who want to take a quick break relax unwind have some spa or just have fun with friend and family but do not nee to travel far to find such a place Let s talk about some pro of the property 1 Location just about an hour from the heart of the city but give you the feeling of be far away from the mad crowd 2 Hospitality Brillaint Special mention to Sindhu very polite always smile and eag to help out guest she be a superstar but in general as well all the staff be extremely well trained and polite you get a feeling of be take care and pamper at every step kudo to the management for make that happen especially consider the amount of guest this property host on a daily basi 3 amenity there aplenty of stuff completely complementary by nature available at the resort which will keep guest of all age and interest engage and also they make sure that everyone be make aware as per the guest s personal interest 4 room Top clas neat clean big and very modern our s come with a nice little sit out area at the back which we enjoy a lot the lawn be well maintain and beautifully decorate with water way and tree 5 Bathroom BIG for the price they charge this be probably one of the big bathroom i have be in a star resort it also come with an outdoor rain shower as an add onu 6 Wifi though its a shame that one would be glue to the internet while be in a relaxing getaway but however if you do nee i have a couple of urgent email to be do they have an excellent wifi availability and coverage free inclusive in our room rate in fact our room have a wifi router in itself not sure though if that the case for all room every coin have a flip side so do this resort though they be completely outweigh by its brilliance and positive 1 Food Bar we have a couple of mock tail and especially the Long Island Ice Tea do not live upto the mark for the price it come for though the Lasuni tikka kabab be spot on brilliant Try this kabab if you love chicken and kabab 2 TV channel in room this be a must they should work up i do not do a thorough check research but most of the movie sport channel do not pop up for guest who wanna go back to the room put their foot up with a drink and watch a movie or 2 do get your own resource along with 3 Swimming pool for traveler like me pool be a key a bit downside that it be under maintenance however i be sure that would be back up pretty soon but overall a great place to spend a little weekend or so i be definitely go back in a couple of month or so whenever stres start take its toll also i have hear this resort offer great spa service however that i keep in reserve for the next visit its amazing to have a visit with family at Windflower undoubtedly good staff who always keen to serve you better and better at all the time i wanna praise the way of handle customer by one gentleman by the name of Mr Vikas Chef very good guy Overall good ambience of the resort just wanna rate 5 out of 5 consider the guy like Vikas in the team all the staff member be so supportive and always keep smile on your face Warm Regards Naveen Mann the resort be locate about 15km 20 Km from airport and about 4 5 KM from main Road Airport Road This can be easily locate on google map the property be good and offer facility like Segway ATV Zorbing trampoline and challengerBridge crossing and a swimming pool Improvement be require at indoor game where the room be small for POOL and foose ball the service be good and some staff be very much prompt and helpful especially Ms Ayesha but some be not that much helpful Food be GOOD and good spread be there for vegetarian also Onky suggestion be that they should use mosquito repellent smoke should not be discharge during the dining the room be ok in interior with sky light bathroom Hot water be problem and in some room it be not available i believe they be use Solar Wifi connectiviyt be good out RegularTelecom signal be weak inside the room we come here for a weekend stay the place be very nice and serene good place to either relax and take spa treatment or do the outdoor activity which be plenty overall a very good experience would definitely recommend this place to other look for a short break Santosh Kumar manager from emerge spa in particular be very courteous and helpful in all our query we have be for a day outing on Republic Day my family have an awesome time here very serene and beautiful resort my two year old daughter have gala time too the staff be very courtesy and helpful we love the hospitality Good vegetarian food and service be top clas i stay here for 2 night and 3 day the property be amazingly maintain the landscaping have a sense of calm peace the room well appointed and innovative the staff warm and helpful the sun light shower with unpolished granite as bath spot add to the feeling of connect with nature and be pure blis while every cottage be surround by greenery there be no pest mosquito or insect in the room the linen be spotless everything available squeaky clean and the decor and ambiance have a soul render feel the pathway well illuminate the pool clean and invite the open air ches board a joy the restaurant have well appoint buffet and the food choicest overall it be an invigorating experience my family have an awesome time here very serene and beautiful resort especially at night the place look heavenly Good food and service to top it all highly recommend for a break away from Bangalore me and my family stay for a day include spend a night we have a pleasant time not a rock time room be nice and well maintain Room service be good however a lot of what be mention on the menu card be not available Food be extreme when it be good it be very good like the desert spread when it be bad it be horrid like the pakoda poha etc the resort be small in size and the property i live in be perhaps larger a few thing to do most of it be chargeable in my opinion it be just like any oth resort but overprice unless they throw in a few freebie like a spa or complimentary ride it definitely be not one of the top resort One can get bore by evening when i compare it to oth resort we be only three so there be likely a reason for the boredom we be also look to relax rather than be on the move all the time gues with a large group it become more enjoyable you can visit the place but please negotiate hard which i do not i learn that there be a all meal package available which i be never inform about land up pay more than i should have i would call this hotel a luxuriou FARMHOUSE i have stay at the windflower Prakruthi i get very nice and calm room which show pond and garden view i really nee to appreciate their open shower concept and food be excellent the staff be very courtesy and helpful the plus point for the resort be they be not far from the city and fully cover with Greenery they even have the well maintain pool some activity like ATV challenge course segway and bird for kid even i just suggest to have big indoor game room totally i have excellent stay i highly recommend this resort to my friend and family member this be one of the good resort i have visit so far the ambience member food activity be excellent and they raise their bar every time they do the service room be neat and clean and the activity that they have be too good Property be really good Food be awesome there be so many activity like paintball rope challenging and the good part be ATV the person who be conduct activity be very helpful overall a very nice experience Property be very good however they nee to meet the expectation of customer in term of service we ve be there for new year celebration package charge be just double for 31st but the experience be average service be the major reason also staff be not that flexible keep the rule book handy we visit here for a one and a half day family outing the resort be huge clean have good food and friendly staff Chef Vikash deserve a special mention as the moment he see that we be a with kid he ask us if we nee anything off the buffet menu for the child it be gesture like these that go into make a hotel child friendly Breakfast selection be vast the resort be stroller pram friendly activity like archery and ATV be interesting Bangalore have very few place where you can see a starlit pollution free sky this be one of them we have book about 25 room and the two large bungalow over the weekend for the wedding celebration of our son the arrangement be quite amazing and frankly the service be beyond expectation the team of Mr Sanal Mr Anand and Mr Vikas go about their work in a quiet and sincere manner the food be nicely lay out and quiet tasty there be some minor glitch like refrigerator electric kettle not work etc in a couple of room also Wifi connectivity be not reliable at time Mobile signal for most network be a little weak at the resort however all service call be attend to very promptly all our guest be simply thrilled to be in the excellent green environment of the resort also full

as flexible and do n t care much for customer service we be kind of take a risk with Holiday Village as we have not visit it before and it be almost half the price which make one wonder but the risk pay off wonderfully 1 Gorgeous green property line by tree include the pool which keep it very cool and under shadow Lovely open air restaurant and very nice village like set 2 room be very cheap and yet very beautiful Clean and aesthetically design Surprising for a property that be mainly day out 3 very courteous and friendly staff which make you feel comfortable they be very flexible with our

Kanakapura road exit from NICE road all our guest mention it that the resort selection be very good Thank you for make our event a great succes we will surely recommend this to our friend in Bangalore and we will visit again with our friend as IPL be go on as a family we think of enjoy the RCB match on big screen and i be happy i be not disappointed the place be quite big and the staff be friendly Food order be vegetarian and we be happy with the choice we make i visit Holiday Village resort as part of a festive celebration take place there not the easy place to reach one need to follow Google Maps very intently to avoid miss the turn that lead to the resort however the resort itself be very good Located in a quiet part of the city the resort offer a great ambience the swim pool offer a refreshing view we find the facility to be very good and the catering be nice as well with a good variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian dish this place can definitely be consider for a family outing particularly if one be live in JP Nagar or around it i book day package for 899rs Nobody care to welcome the guest and offer welcome drink Indoor game like carrom fuseball billiard TT be there but the facility be not air condition have to sweat a lot Food taste good but menu be limited no buffet only plus be the pool under tree shadow average experience spend 200 r more and get well experience in some oth resort a lovely little place to get away for the weekend when you dont want to travel too far from Bangalore attend a wedding n must say its a lovely place to host one the food be awesome though not sure whether all the catering be do by the resort itself the resort be spread such that one can easily be creative with the decor for host a party there be a variety of room from the small one to the big family one with two big room attach with their individual bathroom we have plan a day out with colleague choose this resort with all aspiration but get ruin Nobody to answer the phone call or anybody respond before we reach bad ambiance very poor cleanlines with greasy utensil feel very bad and pained look at beautiful fish keep in non maintain and dirty water sure to get skin disease and itch if get down into swimming pool pool in website look big but in real be very small Seating be very dirty and torn no in charge person or anybody to guide inside the resort i will never recommend to other or visit again the hotel be situate be very good and peaceful location if you want to go away from city pollution and noise then this be the perfect place Small hotel and need some renovation for sure the swimming pool be not great Restaurant be pleasant on Saturday night with live music not sure how the place get bad review but with that in mind my friend and i go here with very low expectation on the turn of event the holiday turn out to be an awesome one at this price i do n t go there with an expectation of a 5 star treatment but the service be really good as Tito and his team really make an effort to make sure we have a good time even when one of my friend injure himself the first aid be so quick and swift the staff be very courteous not sure about the resort past but there have be a lot of improvement as me and my group of friend have a really good time just about average resort room in building be a strict no Do n t get resort feeling but like a hotel Food strictly average Swimming pool can not be use at all near main entrance and no depth at all look good in pic reality be something else all in all can be avoid Space be not an issue with this Resort for the limited number of room this place have a swimming pool play area and lawn the room lack maintenance if renovation be do this Resort could certainly get a high rating the staff be courteous but they be in need of professional training i have be to this place with family nothing much to enoy they have one big swimming pool one play area food be good their service be good place to relax which be near to Kanakapura road staff be too kind visit Holiday Village resort and find that no water in the rest room after lot of struggle get the water facility be not good and suggest not to visit the resort not recommend Pathetic one 4 5 5 a good chapter begin with great memory they say i must say the holiday village be one such place to have as a venue for your engagement or wedding to start of their proces be simple and transparent with no hullabaloo the staff take into account your choice of venue within the premise we opt for the lawn due to the weather threat of the cyclone the staff be quick enough to accommodate us in the restaurant area the area be a good fit for a crowd of 150 we expect Mr Ashley who be in charge of our day do a marvelous job in arrange the food tasting on time in his absence Mr Pavan and Mr Rajath be there at every Beck and call a very humble and accommodate staff that need good appreciation pick the phone call less than two ring i must say the owner Ajith Bindra carry a humble head over his shoulder help us design a sumptuous buffet for an affordable price all in all this place give us a great day and we look forward to the wedding as well the previous night stay and dinner since the crowd be huge the service be delay Would be nice if the room have a round of pest control apart from that well maintain bathroom and clean bed we find a lot of appreciation from our guest on the taste of the food the variety of the spread and how wonderful the place look the food indeed be great Thankyou for a great day a great engagement venue indeed we have travel with family for a wedding in Bangalore and we book this place as it happen to be near the wedding avenue but we be solely disappointed with the place room look totally different than the photograph showcase in the web there be no closet or place to keep our luggage no direct line to housekeeping and there be hardly someone at the reception to pick up phone no hand towel or towel rod in the bathroom Many of the light fitting be not work we spot lot of cockroach and a few big moth in the room overall a sub par experience would n t recommend to other unless management take cognizance of these anomaly and rectify them we have be to this hotel from our office Hotel be not just unhygienic but the taste of the food be really bad the water dispenser be unclean and washroom stink the hotel overall layout be good but not well maintain my five star rating be especially for their staff they be very kind and accomadative the resort be not overcrowded and that be another plus point the food be good the only suggestion i can think of be to increase their activity option Good place easy to locate have all modern amenity room also be OK service be bit slow but than too o recommend it only for solo people family people keep this place as your last option on chat rest all be ok really bad experience at the place i stay here for 3 day and here be my experience Room Facilities Damp Smell very aggressive Damp smell in the room ask to change the suite they say that no room be available while on makemytrip it be still show an option to book another suite Hot water they have a geysar on the top which they turn on only on demand and turn it off after sometime themselves i specifically ask them to turn on the geysar on see cold water in the bathroom after 1 hour when i go to take a bath there be no hot water on call they say that they turn it off after sometime as they assume that i would have take a bath by then this happen on all 3 day really pathetic to see that you have to beg for hot water Reception Number no one pick the number reception 555 not at all after 6 PM and may be after a few call before that at least tell a guard to pick up the call in case of any urgency really sad Utilities Bathroom do nt contain the dental kit or shampoo etc Only soap apparently everything be available on request only Wifi there be no wifi as oppose to what they promise on makemytrip on call they say that Sir we have write the word wifi Subject to availability on the website therefore it be your fault that you do not read it no wifi signal be there in suite Dirty linen the bedsheet and pillow cover be really dirty change them the guy bring a new one which be also dirty so at the 3rd time he get a decently clean one without smell and dirty mark Dirty room on enter we could see a layer deep dirt track on the table and chair have to get that clean by the room service use item one could easily tell that most item be use and refill kind of like those dirty trick which hotelier use the brush which sadly i use once all its bristle spread open like a mes only after brush my tooth once i be pretty sure that they simply take our used brush put them in hot water to straighten the bristle and then give them to the next customer Breakfast Ordinary Spread Less than ordinary spread even a 1000 rupee Treebo hotel spread be well Everyday Oily poori bhaji a bland Upma a pratha and bread omellette and a few thing here n there my only solace be the bread omellete Rest all be in edible tasteles Availability almost after my breakfast be over i ask if there be anything to drink welcome drink etc the guy say that there be juice include in the buffet but we do not keep it in the open as there be only a few guest in the hotel today if you want i can get that for you so their cost cutting method be to hide item in the back and only if a customer ask then bre it forth so you better keep ask them about all item on day 1 there be no fruit and same logic the guy say that since there be few guest they do nt bother to get the fruit on day 2 the reason be different he say that a huge corporate party come in the mornig and eat all the fruit so no fruit or curd etc so less ppl pr more people you wo nt get item available Hygiene apart from the dirty floor there be fruit fly on the bread which be keep in the open the only good thing about the place be that the room service staff be quite polite and resourceful but really do not recommend this place unless you be come with your colleague on the company money and do not mind all above except for a place to play very good place to spend weekend we be in for 3 day Gala time good staff especially Vikram Naresh decently maintain room price be moderate too pretty good service Swimming pool need more maintanence though overall a great experience thank we have organize a wedding here on nov 2 with more than 1000 guest very good place not very far from the city Excellent support by Resort manager Mr Ashley for the wedding Most of the guest love the ambiance People look for a wedding destination can check out this place we stay close to Holiday Village and often go there for dinner and drink the restaurant be good with plenty of food option we be not big fan of their buffet since the spread be not very expansive and some of the dish dont resonate with us Most of our trip have be drink dinner Tandoori starter be good but expansive Food be pretty ok as well but there be nothing that stand out here Service will be slow if the occupancy be more than 30 40 we be a group of 20 people who come here for a day out the restaurant area be peaceful with light music and scrumptious food be lay out in buffet the pool area also have speaker we be very impressed with the indoor activity available the outdoor activity be fun as well the manager Ashley be very helpful and courteous as be the entire staff definitely would visit again we arrange our wedding reception at holiday village and be a

not include tax at no point when we sit to eat or during breakfast be we tell it wasnt include they ask our room number and that be it Its very disappointing for an advertised 4 5 star hotel to have this happen it be clear up at reception that day but then on check out they try to make us pay it again we dispute it and it be once again clear we pay the room bill of the few item we have buy and then after leave the hotel check the room bill we have be bill for a small drink coke maybe that we didnt have and it be almost 4 200rs for a 330ml coke which be 35r in the shop it be also worth nothing that they charg 3 different kind of tax to an amount of 23 a little disappointing end to a great stay hi Meeting time again we choose this Slo restaurant due to many prior excellent experience

extra care of me and ensure my stay be comfortable the complimentary chocolate be too nice that i have to order some for me to take back home water be over flow out of the bathroom the staff there be not friendly they simply charge me exces for the mainatnence they dint even issue a valid GST BILL for the maintenance which i pay visit for two night with my husband and infant son we have a relaxing time Its a new and beautiful hotel with good amenity the breakfast buffet be extensive and very good Couple of suggestion a few chairs lounge could be provide near the swimming pool Its such a beautiful place which could be develop more the hot choclate voucher can be display more prominently it be hide away in a drawer and only find it by chance i be on a busines trip and the hotel be extremely convenient in all kind of possible way the staff be extremely helpful and go out of their way to attend to you the rooftop have immense potential and spectacular view Keep it up guy the hotel itself be decent and in a good location but lot of problem 1 Service be very poor give me a room on the smoking floor despite a specific request for a non smoking room at the time of booking have to change room twice before be give a prop room 2 Breakfast buffet be not good Poor option not refill on time 3 Check out be tedious Reception be not man by the appropriate personnel 4 bed be not comfortable pillow be too hard Will only stay here again if there be no oth option i lead a group of 14 people to Bengaluru to do 2 day of pop up medical clinic in another area of the city this hotel and its staff be quite welcoming and accommodate one minor disappointment after make the reservation for my group 8 rooms 6 double and 2 single i call the hotel a week ahead of our arrival to ask that the 6 double room must specifically have 2 bed in the room as the occupant be unmarried and in one case be a father and adult daughter travel together i be assure that this would be possible i follow up with an email that include a rooming list upon arrival i be tell that only 3 of the double room would have 2 bed 1 of the room with one bed be assign to the father and daughter while roll away bed be offer for the oth 3 this be not a workable solution as there really be n t enough free space in the room to make that a safe option after we have check in i run into Sheena the Housekeeping Manager she ask if we be enjoy our room i explain to her our situation with the double room she and i consult with the occupant of 2 of the room and they graciously agree that they could make it work with just the one bed however my father daughter team need a different option Ms Sheena check room availability and offer to upgrade them to a junior suite at no additional charge to us while the suite also have only 1 bed there be plenty of room to safely bre in a roll away although this option be initially only offer for 1 night until a standard double room become available we end up keep the room for the length of our stay Ms Sheena definitely go above and beyond our expectation in come up with a solution to this problem i want to also recognize the Duty Manager Ramesh and the Front Office Supervisor Rohini i have instruct my group that our organization be pay for the room and meal at the restaurant only and that anything they charge to the room would be on their own account Ramesh suggest that the team use my room number when dine in the hotel restaurant as this would make it easy for us to reconcile everything at check out both Ramesh and Rohini be great at check out provide me with individual room print out as well as a consolidated room print out and an itemize restaurant bill we have quite a bit of luggage carry our medical supply and the hotel bell staff store it for us in the luggage room during our stay this be quite helpful as we would otherwise have need to take all 10 bag to our room the include buffet breakfast have a good selection of Indian and western style item we also take lunch and dinner at the hotel s restaurant the food be very good and well present Everyone rave about the french fry without the room issue i would definitely have rate this property higher we book this hotel after read all the good review we stay 4 night in this relatively new hotel about 3mths this hotel have about 90 room in total look like a boutique hotel we book 2 room and i email them to request for early check in as we be land 9 am in Bangalore however they be not able to accommodate early check in as they be fully book apparently they be normally fully book during weekday so we get there at about 11 am and we have to wait quite a while to check in Front desk tell us that they can give us 1 room first and the 2nd room at 2 pm we get into our room and we be very impressed with the room very trendy and chic setup really comfortable room and bed no issue with the room at all it be almost perfect there be complimentary cookie about 6 piece everyday there be touch screen pad for room service housekeeping etc you can even connect your music to that machine for speaker my only issue be that there should have different number for room service front desk room to room call and housekeeping we have to keep call front desk for every service when we do not use the touchpad when we go back in the evening to check into our 2nd room we have issue we could not get the already ready room due to some technical issue with the acces card this cause quite inconvenience to us as we be a family of 4 and 2 of us be in 2nd floor and the oth 2 in the 6th floor we realise on the 2nd day that the hotel be short staffed their service be beyond expectation from the bell boy to housekeeping to front desk but very slow there be a few lapse in service here and there but we do not make any issue as their service when receive always be beyond expectation and we understand that it be due to short staff we also have free hot chocolate available for the room at night not notify to us by the staff but one of our room have the complimentary slip Breakfast be quite ordinary 1st day be exciting and after that it get kinda boring we be inform that we have complimentary 15mins leg massage on our 3rd day there we try it Nothing much if you have have massage in Thailand and Indonesia that is we realise on the 2nd day that the hotel be short staffed their service be beyond expectation from the bell boy to housekeeping to front desk but very slow there be a few lapse in service here and there but we do not make any issue as their service when receive always be beyond expectation and we understand that it be due to short staff the staff be kind enough to give us late check out for one of the room as we be depart late night that be a very kind gesture this hotel will definitely be my preferred choice of stay if i get back to Bangalore Sapnil Debolina Ramesh ensure you receive the good of the service and always add their personalised yet professional touch to make your entire stay be it busines or leisure very comfortable and cozy for busines i stay at this hotel over a week the location be pretty convenient but surprisingly it be quiet Facility

Overall Nice hotel with nice room and view only disappointment be the Breakfast area which be small and with limited option of food otherwise nice to stay and though i be there only for one night its a decent place to put up on i stay at Radisson in September 2018 the hotel be centrally locate and close to 1mg and Lido mall which have shopping supermarket and eat option there be a Mc Donalds at

of greenery Large swimming pool and jog track Complimentary breakfast be sumptuous tasty and elaborate House keeping be poor need renovation since the property be very old nee to augment their roll stock like bath towel on occupancy i have to wait for 8 hour to get my first bath towel for relax ok to stay Do not expect modern standard if you book on deep discount then value for money otherwise not worth pay my last impression of Golden Palms when i visit a couple of year ago be poor i write that it be a good property poorly maintain my recent visit completely overturn my impression and i find the room and the banquet space well maintain the attitude of hospitality be also far superior to my early experience and overall there be a caring and committed management presence i must particularly mention Sahoo in banquet who make our conference experience comfortable and productive with his very competent and caring service the restaurant service as well as front office be warm and friendly it be clear that there be an overall cultural transformation for the well my compliment to the management and the staff Terrible hygiene Steam room reek of urine Great decor but dirty bedroom Food make me i ll as buffet be so unsanitary Do not be mislead by posh exterior Front desk staff be unhelpful though management try to assist Great uniformed staff Lovely ground but glas by a poolside no attention to international or even local hotel standard stay at the Golden Palms Hotel for two night as part of the organising team of a Rotary District Conference the resort be well equip with room multiple hall of different capacity from 50 to 1000 different to serve Food and Beverages a wonderful Poolside to have and afternoon brunch or an evening get together they have good vendor for all the requirement such as entertainment Audio Visuals although on the more expensive side as compare to oth vendor transportation etc the check in and check out be handle efficiently the valet service be quick the transportation of people and baggage to the room through buggy and by foot be well manage they could have a couple of more buggy to handle large crowd and for travel within the resort Food Options be plenty for the banquet their in house Lounge and Restaurant be a good option to wine and dine the property have age and definitely need renovation the room have an old look with creep door and window bathroom nee a lot of work to bre them back to current standard Room service be slow Housekeeping be excellent Will definitely consider this venue for large Banquets and Corporate outing consider what they offer for the price Attitude of staff be too bad no care arrogant staff treat customer like fool never visit this place its not worth spend 1700 totally disappointed with the visit food also too bad facility be not hygiene pro Huge property with lot of space to stroll and play very nice pool and its very big Cons Zero Maintainence do the hallway stink and inside the room foul smell of some food Bathroom fixture and furniture in the room be not in good condition you will get Bathroom mat face towel and TV remote only when request also if you order something to your room expect a wait time if minimum 45 minute to one hour the staff be rude and not well mannered the executive at the checkin counter be rude when we ask for the lunch option the security supervisor check your bag every time you go in from the reception to see if you have bring liquor from outside as per the hotel policy no liquor be allow from outside they scan your bag to dig the liquor out Food be just okay but not worth the package we take the place be always crowd with corporate package on if you be plan to visit with your family to relax i would say Reconsider this option Nice hotel with a friendly staff get a good ambience and the swimming pool and jog track be awesome the restaurant inside be good food server and the buffet be intercontinental cuisine and mouth water stay here for my company meeting around 25 km from Majestic suggest to take a taxi Smooth check in Wonderful spacious room face swimming pool you can either walk to room or they have solar

staff to cater to the room call immediately in room service also take time however overall experience be pleasant the hotel be fairly good for a company team outing Enough space nice pool if the hotel would not claim to be a 5star hotel my rating would be well however claim to be a 5star be completely wrong there be mile to go to reach that level no towel in the room dirty bedsheet it would be easy to make a longer list we be here for 2 night to attend a wedding and be pleasantly surprised the property be very well spread out with ample space beautiful garden and greenery Standard room be spacious well than some of the 5 star property in India with cramped room comfortable and well equipped suite such as Tipu Sultan suite and one oth do n t remember the name be amazingly plan and lay out Good for a bride to get dressed because they be very spacious Pool side be massive the food we have be the one serve at the wedding and it meet standard Room service and service in general be slow they take a lot of time to tend to you in the room probably because of the vast property and shortage of staff maybe a slight problem for old people with difficult in walk because the property be huge

central busines area hotel this time i try the Golden palm hotel and be happy with my choice it be locate in a very serene area and one feel really relaxed in that environment the service be just as great the choice of restaurant and facility be excellent though i do not get to use much of the facility i specially like my breakfast experience where i be overwhelm by the service give by the pamper staff the stay be extremely pleasant the staff be very hospitable the service quality be flawless the property claim to be a 5 star but in reality will hardly qualify for a 3 star property the property be old and be not maintain the room be spacious but the furniture be not upto the mark the mattress be old and flattened the shower in the bathroom be clog the king bed just fall apart into two with the mattress not stay in place at all to top it all the staff be not professional and far from what you would expect at a 5 star place i be lock out of room for 30 min because the room lock get discharge and it take them 30 min to fix it the breakfast variety be okay but not great what spoil it all be the fact that the bread be clearly not fresh and maybe a couple of day old the pool be quite big and so be the garden the room also have a seating arrangement outside on the porch face the garden it use to be a great place for family vacation a few year ago but not any more i be completely dusappointe by the quality of room service restaurant pool all department the staff be very unapproachable the taste of food in restaurant be pathetic while the price be of5 star rate pls avoid if you can not value for money at all our party arrive during April a pleasant time of year to arrive in southern India this be our first hotel and by far the most pleasant with spacious and comfortable room The staff be both courteous and considerate take great care of the young member of our party who be 7 year of age she spend a lot of her wonderful stay here in the pool The food be excellent and feature many traditional S Indian dish which be among the good in the whole of the Sub Continent i would particularly like to make mention of Ms Kajal Singh banquet director who be so helpful in accommodate our party Wonderful accommodation wonderful food wonderful situation highly recommended i visit this resort over the weekend there be initial hiccup when we book over the phone and it be confirm but when we walk in the staff have us wait we be offer welcome drink only once we make the payment Anyways the resort be spic and span very courteous staff who drive us till our room the staff at the swimming pool be very courteous room be very clean and very nice Room service be a little expensive then the highlight of the day candle light dinner this be the most memorable experience my wife give me and be well organized very courteous staff amazing 5 star quality food and simply brilliant i will visit again and recommend this place i be attend an exhibition nearby and be look for decent place around come across this hotel and decide on it even though i see mixed review after a 7 hr drive to the hotel i be just look to check in and get some rest the elevation and the grand water fountain as we enter the hotel be spectacular but trouble start at the time of checkin i have to wait for 15 minute because the manager be busy with a huge group of corporate client eventually the manager Pramod sort out the minor issue and i be off to the room the walk be very pleasant because of the extensive greenery and landscape the room be spacious and the bathroom be decent Free water bottle as well the breakfast buffet be near the extra large grandeour pool the spread be quite extensive with indoor and outdoor seating i do n t have food in any of the oth restaurant there be small shop for any grocery about 3kms from the hotel the head of operation Mr Manoj Kumar overhear my conversation with reception i be share a few observation such as the safe in the room be not work there be no hand towel or face towel or floor mat in bathroom he immediately address it and this show that the management be very serious about such issue i also have the feeling that they will go extra mile to take care of the guest when i need a rental car to go to the exhibition about 6 km away they let me take another taxi that be already wait for another hotel employee that do n t nee it until an hour later perhaps some more diligent and strict floor manager be require to monitor minor thing that customer notice and feel Example coffee packet be miss on two of three day etc a tip to traveller it not easy to get a cab in this area Give yourself extra time if you be in need of one Overall an amazing property with great potential to be a five star resort if you be look for place to detox yourself from the world and get pampered well check this place out Big room and big resort with all the require aminetie pool gym spa play area with a good area to walk around you can just check in and relax Staff be always polite and go that extra mile to get thing do for you hi stay here with family for three day and have a great family time together the detail be 1 first

preparation and some continental dish the high tea only one snack tea coffee serve for 30 minute be inadequate and they need to upgrade it also they need to do a well job of guest sitting arrangement we be wait in queue for long for a table allotment but oth guest be just walk and grab the table on weekend it be chao 7 at the same time i must mention here that their Caf staff be work very hard to make our stay comfortable the Caf solario staff be courteous helpful and always ready to provide service with a smile i especially want to thank Mr Francis DGM and the entire Caf Solario chef kitchen serve staff and their captain cafe manager for provide us with top clas service and for their positive attitude on request they make separate food for my father s special dietary need and serve us a complimentary chocolate cake simply yummy and tasty hot starter like Gobi Paneer Manchurian thank a ton again to the entire Caf Solario staff Mr Francis 8 we order in room dining House keeping In room dining service be good 9 Could not use their Spa facility and also their specialty Chinese restaurant 10 Check out be smooth and billing be in perfect order Overall will definitely recommend this large resort property with big room and staff with excellent service attitude for enjoy family time together Go for it apparently this use to be a classy hotel but that be way back in time before the ownership change hand now it more a favorite haunt for corporate off site sale meet and loud wedding the property be interesting landscaped but the garden do nee more care and attention the statue dot across the property be questionable in taste especially one with a couple of shoddily sculpt horse and a mer couple the room be decent but the bathroom fitting be rickety and seem way past their sell by date the service be terrible my room have an ironing board but no iron also miss be hand towel and bathrobe the attitude of the staff be to start with a no to and request you have to stand firm and insist on whatever you re ask for before you get it to sum up it probably a great place if you re think of take a rambunctious sale team for an off site or party but if it a classy ambience you re look for look elsewhere we be here on a two day offsite meeting the resort be cut off yet not far off from the airport the property be well maintain and room be spacious and luxurious we have buffet food which be good with a lot of variety we have to wait for bread rotis on quite a few occasion though maybe because of the weekend rush overall a pleasant stay and quite a good break if require for a day the staff be courteous and extremely attentive to customer need have all level of staff have at least understand basic English communication would be an advantage consider they have visitor from all over India overall a pleasant stay and would recommend go back visit 3 yr back and have great memory from room to spa and food pool staff and cleaning etc now in Sept 18 2nd week when visit and stay for night be worst ever experience terribly uncleaned spa pool lawn and perhaps deteriorate from 5 star to roadside dhaba and low clas resort Sports area person behave and he be lose his money to

facelift by now but alas no it could be so much nice it really very tired now and the garden be unkempt the charge should be lower in line with the steady decline the landscaping be just about okay and not maintain at all the table in the conference room be cover by white sheet and under it be insect ride furniture the food be really sad the staff service be like a gamble some be okay and some

service ourself and finally the guy come and spray some room freshener but after 20 min or so the stink be back so we again call the reception and request a change in the room to which she say she will check and get back but never come back they talk to you nicely but do nt care about your concern our stay include complimentary buffer lunch buffet Dinner breakfast Food be very good and very tasty we take a little over 45 min to have lunch as one of us have to look after our 1 year old kid while the oth ate but here also we experience very bad service the lady manager be absolutely rude and come over and ask if we finish our lunch when we be midway apparently they have way too many guest as they also do dayout not our fault if they ca n t manage dayout hotel guest the swim pool be good though and we have some fun there but room service be very bad and take a loooong time and have to be remind at least 2 time even for a bottle of water except for checkout that be fast overall the stay be just OK very good amenity but horrible service i will not go there again i spend a day at this resort day outing package i be charge Rs 1500 for a package consist of Welcome Drink Breakfast Lunch and High Tea plus use of facility such as lawn indoor game and the swimming pool the resort look aged and i do n t see any validate reason for it charge the price that it be charge for the service render be it a day guest or resident the welcome drink be just flavor sugar water the breakfast be too basic more like a simple South Indian meal of idli vada sambar chutney poori boil egg etc the lawn be decent enough but request for drinking water require multiple follow up before the staff bring in water canister for my group the lunch be again too basic and i feel the resort be take me and my group for a ride it seem more like a set 3 course meal rather than a buffet i have dine at many resort and have a fair understanding on what to expect at a lunch in a day out setting the overall attitude and service of the resort staff be not satisfactory it be definitely a poor return on my investment the locker room by the pool be horrible Dirty and wet only save grace be the large pool which could have be clean and the indoor game room i will definitely avoid go back to this resort we visit this place last weekend it be a short trip an overnight stay we stay at the Deluxe room

2 in Swimming pool the management can employ a full time Guard for safety purpose presently no guard be there so little risky during any mishap Atleast the guard can be employ during peak hour i LOVE the stay and it a a very memorable stay thank i have mix review about this hotel what i love be the room once you cros the reception there be lush green internal road towards the block each block be g

u cros all that its so pleasant Calm and quiet Beautiful garden pool there be outdoor sport as well F B be okay not great not bad Service staff extremely polite but room service be a bit slow i gues because its a huge property Security staff keep walk at night Its lovely at night Venue would be excellent for marriage offsite etc i would urge them to improve upon the infrastructure at the entry point and focu on maintenance especially the banquet hall it be a nice place yummy food nice amenity nice location nice hospitality and a big swimming pool to enjoy overall it a great trip with the team bit expensive though like the place thank Beautiful place well maintain food be average bit expensive but worth a visit for the experience can see variety of plant in the premise Dinner at pool

Palms be a great place to have a get together with a small large group of friend Great location quiet yet reasonably near to Bengaluru the room the pool and the conference facility be well lay out and can comfortably take a busines conference some of the furniture be a bit dated and need some maintenance but not a bad place to go to visit in January 1st week be really disappointed here be the lowlight 1 the room service be bad get spoilt tea in morning 2 see rowdy create rucku in pool and then it be unusable as it get dirty Avoid go to Golden Palms resort this be a resort have one big field for all kind of activity to do weather for family or for corporate outing Service be good maintain the timing for the same Food be good restaurant be far from the reception the place be huge with good room i be at the Tipu sultan suite the breakfast and meal be good though the service be very slow we be a group of 60 so wait for meal be an issue and last of seat place during lunch be a problem the property be huge so we could plan our event and training well even though there be atleast 2 3 oth group the arrangement be well manage even though the checkin take time oth group have plan a pull party so it be very very noisy for us i would say this a good place if u be on a corporate offsite wo nt recommend for couple of fly holiday as its too noisy and crowded stay at golden palm for 31 night new year eve with family and my infant have high expectation on service and quality but be di appoint i speak with resort manager he admit that due to new yr eve all staff be busy with preparation and hence they be unable to focu on guest some un happy point make us wait in lobby for 45 min say room be get ready when we go to the room key be not work again have to wait for 30 min room be not tidy enough i have certain expectation as i be charge 12500 r per night basic essential in room be not available resort account guy call up multiple time and say to complete billing before 31st night as he have to finish his billing in yr 2017 D no value for money at all not worth 12 5 k we have be to many resort and hotel in many country incl India over the year and i can say with full confidence that this be our bad experience ever so much so that we actually leave the resort within 24 hr of our check in 1 Check in the check in proces be a sign of thing to come it seem like they be not organize because they could n t find our reservation for a bit then they ask for our Aadhar card passport for all people stay 4 of us and would not accept our PAN card thankfully we have a soft copy and that save us 2 room we be take to our room and they be very underwhelming for a resort of 5 start quality as soon as i enter i notice the previous owner have leave a use plate on the table in the balcony which i point out to the hotel staff he promptly keep the plate outside the balcony and it stay there until we check out Everything about the room be off the table cover be dirty and stained the cupboard below the TV have a break door the tissue box in the bathroom have no tissue the toilet paper roll be not in its right place plus the bad thing be when my son put his toy car beneath the bed and i have to peak in it be the most disgusting sight that i have see in a hotel room it be one thing to not clean below the bed for a week and its a health hazard to not clean it for six month there be food dust tissue paper and god know what else 3 Food Food be very very average but extremely pricey they have buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner we manage to find a few item that suit us but the rest especially the breakfast be very greasy so much so that we have to eat bread and butter to keep ourselves healthy i also notice what i think be a dead ant in the cold milk and point it out promptly to the hotel staff there be suppose to be three restaurant in the resort but when you look at how desolate the Italian and Chinese restaurant be from the outside you will be scared to go in i wonder if those be even operational 4 Crowd this be probably the most irritating part of the whole stay they have day out package which invite the corporate crowd or oth people who come during the day to treat it like a picnic spot this really ruin the resort experience for family who come to stay there be no exclusivity to the amenity the lunch buffet be like a crowded wedding gathering every place in the resort be crowd during the day plus you see people sit on the lawn which you be not suppose to and playing game etc 5 amenity this be the only PRO for this place the pool be big the game room be well maintain especially the carrom board and TT table they also have tenni squash and badminton there be also a small kid playground which be well maintain again because there be a huge crowd during the day it can get difficult to enjoy this the kid play room be a joke 6 Staff i pity the staff at this resort they be utterly clueless and not train enough to deal with this situation you realize the staff be not passionate about what they do or may be they be not incentivize either 7 Check out when we tell we be check out early they get worried that we will ask them for a refund but when we tell them we do n t want a refund and we be check out because we utterly hate the experience they seem to breathe a sigh of relief and do nt even bother to ask us what be wrong not surprising at all also they give us the food bill for the previous owner and we have to tell them that its not our bill 8 expense the place be pretty expensive on the scale of a five star resort Buffet lunch for 4 could cost you around 5k but the service offer for the steep price be like a one star resort to conclude if you be a family look for a relaxing stay at a resort then please STAY away from this place if you be a corporate group look for a one day picnic outing then maybe it be the right place i be not sure at a minimum this place should be rename as Golden Palms Picnic Spot this be an amazing resort with all possible amenity and facility a must for family friend couple office outing Swimming pool be amazing with fresh water drink be good with affordable price but beware the local bar tender may charge extra Go in the morning and have a bright day with indoor and outdoor game Take all food and drink stuff as you wo n t get any shop nearby Food be above average stay there for two day and thoroughly enjoy the property be huge fill with greenery have a wonderful morning with lot of play and activity organise by hotel guy the food be wonderful and a lot of variety the pool side restaurant be amazing and the pool be huge the center of attraction of the property i must say Service be five star room be big but old and must nee a renovation i gues all in all a nice experience visit this awesome place on 3rd Nov 17 and i must say that the experience be indeed amazing the large swimming pool variety of cuisine for breakfast the arrangement for DJ Live orchestra everything be just above par a must visit place if you be ever visit Bangalore we stay with friend and family over a 3 day weekend trip out of Bangalore this place have a halo of be once own by Bollywood personality Sanjay Khan who very passionately manage this place and build a reputation around it we be expect at least basic to be there however the entire stay leave us regret our decision there be load and load of thing to improve pro 1 Amazing potential with spacious room infrastructure grandeur 2 well maintain garden 3 Live counter in buffet Cons area of improvement 1 the check in proces itself they ask for govt ID card for all of us when we check in we book the place 1 week ago and this could have be intimate or take care of earlier it take 30mins just to check in 2 Maintenance very poorly maintain infrastructure this include the electrical fitting wall swimming pool be so dirty like a public swimming pool sport area and just about everything 3 Hygiene Place be dirty and unhygienic Green algae in the pool restaurant Italian one look like clean 15yrs ago Stained carpet stain sofa 4 Management attitude even when these thing be bring to notice they start defend it stain oh we have cocktail party there so people spill it Check in oh it a govt rule so we have to comply 5 Overall experience the overall experience be bad and have know what we know now we would have never book this place also we get a sense that this resort be just focusse on corporate booking and do not want to entertain family etc perhaps they nee to understand that corporate event will follow individual good experience stay here for a day as part of a corporate group the property be fairly large and the pool be the attraction the garden be good for a walk as well Property show clear sign of age Food be just about passable breakfast be terrible you do n t get Uber Ola easily so make sure you book a cab thro the hotel s travel desk the game room be quite small for a property this size we be a group of 25 friend with family want to have a reunion to celebrate 25yr of friendship and Golden Palms be the perfect place for us we enjoy the hospitality and food and oth facility at the property kid and adult alike have a wonderful time especially at the pool and oth sport facility there we have book room for an overnight stay and the experience be quite good with well appoint staff who be very helpful the food be good too look forward to visit again the property be far away from the city s hustle and this a great place for a weekend getaway in a City that be all about trend fashion and Techy people this be a great place for hangout relaxation with its nature theme environment and all the arrangement be perfect with a great team to execute every request of the guest and a place which kid will absolutely love to spend with the pool and many activity for them to keep them enjoy there vacation also couple can have a great time as well with nature s peace i would suggest everyone to visit the place before they deice and guarantee that you would fall in love with this place it about a km from Makali on the huskur road Valet parking be available here the pool be the main highlight of this place Swimming costume be mandatory there be also a badminton tenni squash court Foosball car room ches and oth indoor activity Outdoor they give a tug of war rope also they have open space to conduct game Food be OK Service have improve over the year Good place to hangout for corporate and family room be average Could be maintain better Nice place to be with Family in the nature lot of game swimming good bar on the swimming pool clean room large conference room with big screen sound system friendly staff big property with lot of tree and flower stay only for one night for some busines workshop Experience be average Positive Calm and quite environment very conducive for focused work Many conf room be available and can accommodate large team Friendly and accommodate staff Food be average Breakfast do n t have many option but overall nicely build up huge property and a good weekend gateway i stay in this resort for 3 day to attend a meeting Ideal place for conference far away from City be a big property it be ideal to have conference Food service be great room be ok it be a bit run down Room service be excellent Breakfast too be great one of the very good place i have see for stay and enjoy your time here we have spend very good quality time with our group during our stay the hotel stay be awesome and really memorable the food taste be also good stay at the Golden Palms Hotel and Spa over the weekend from saturday30th September through Monday 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti it be a long weekend with Monday be off the hotel be fully book i travel with 2 friend and book directly with the hotel Check in formality be carry out smoothly and quickly we be allocate a room on the ground floor with pool view near their restaurant Cafe Solaire the room be spacious with a sit out the fridge in the room be not work nor be there a mini bar the bathroom be spacious too but the shower door do not seal tight and hence the water would flood the dry area of the bathroom what i like 1 spacious property nice to stroll around large enough to walk jog 2 lot of flora however it would be nice if the name of the respective plant flower be mention beside them 3 well equipped gym separate section for lady jacuzzi steam and sauna 4 lots of activity to choose from the overall ambience be pleasing what i do not like 1 this property boast of a large swimming pool and it be one of the main reason we book our stay however the main pool be under renovation and this be not mention anywhere on their website the recreational pool be available but guest be use it in their regular clothe instead of in prop swimming attire 2 we have lay the towel that be give to us for use jacuzzi on a bench nearby the attendant walk in with a few oth guest and give them our towel leave but 1 towel between 3 of us and tell us he would replace our towel by the time we finish neither the attendant nor the towel be available after we be do in an hour i have to wait in my wet costume for 30 min while my friend try to find the attendant towel 3 for dinner we order room service a vegetable combo that come with 1 roti so we ask for 2 extra roti the bill however be charge at 125 INR for 3 roti on call to clarify be tell it be charge as such because we order from the round the clock menu as oppose to room service menu when this explanation be challenge question the call be hand over to another staff and he speak rudely with his voice raise a revise bill be then present 4 after meal in the room the dish place outside the room be not clear till much later the guest stay next door to us order all their meal in room and would place the dish outside close to our door from a hygienic aspect in a 5 property this be a huge concern let alone the aesthetic aspect 5 for our spa experience we have a chat with the person incharge at the time of booking and mention we want head massage along with the body massage we choose on consult with the PIC we all choose the ayurveda massage which include head massage in the rate however this be not tell to us the spa staff would have cunningly charge us 3000 taxis for head massage alone if we have not question the bill 6 on Sunday the Cafe Solaire have a lunch buffet with live counter and unlimited drink this be not communicate to us either via poster post at the cafe which be usually the norm in oth good properties nor by call it be a long weekend there be a lot of guest who have take a day only package and i gues the management want more pay customer and deliberately do not mention the Sunday buffet to the guest who have already pay for room 7 on spot a cappuccino machine during breakfast i ask for a cup and be tell by a person of the staff that it be not work when i see another guest have cappuccino in span of no less than 10 minute i ask another staff why the lie she first say that it be only a steamer when i tell her i know a cappuccino machine when i see one and that a another guest be have the same she then offer me a cup the only reason i feel compelled to review this hotel be because it charge as per a 5 property but leave a lot to be desire in the 5 experience include staff who be not soft skill train discrepancy while billing be human error and one can overlook the fact but dubious way of billing be just not acceptable Will i revisit this property again i probably will i will first brush up on my mathematical skill have be at Golden Palms for nearly two week for a project offsite Overall experience be very good Positive Calm and quite environment very conducive for focused work Many conf room be available and can accommodate large team Friendly and accommodate staff Good restaurant Cafe Solaire Chef and manager pay personal attention to ensure that team be not bore of the option Large swimming pool Location be very close to NICE and Nelamangala road intersection hence commute time from city be relatively less 24x7 WiFi be available Areas of improvement due to hectic work could not enjoy oth facility at resort option seem to be limit for engage child if you be go with family we have go as a team of 70 people to Golden palm even though there be oth company on their team outing we do not feel congestion as the property be big enough the room be well maintain with fresh towel and toiletry the lunch buffet be ordinary but the breakfast have a large number of option it have one of the large swimming pool which be maintain well Food be really awesome here moderately large swimming pool to have fun a good sport complex and cricket ground all and all i

neatly maintain have be to this place as part of Day Outing program and wow its so nice silent place to relax and have fun amidst lot of greenary and a huge huge pool love it Only thing be the game part be quite limited and they can expand it if the management give a push look great on the net but the place be pretty poor Food be average People be a bunch money eat greeter for everything u have to pay if you plan to play cricket shuttle then you have to pay for ball swimming pool care taker be very rude for small small thing he will shout like he be pay us or free of cost we go there and swim in very sort i can say that note be there to enjoy for team out it awesome place to stay and relax room be specious and service be very good i like the food quality Pool side have enough space to relax and enjoy you can also conduct office conference very well they be have good banquet Overall very good experience never stay at Golden Palm Spa and Resort for the following reason 1 they be not GST compliant they will provide you the Bill in their fix format 2 Front Desk staff and even Manager be hopeless and they do n t know how to converse with the client 3 on first day they will provide you the bad room in which A C do n t work 4 as soon you reach first floor to your room there be garbage place and as it be stinking it seem their housekeeping staff have not visit that floor from 15 day 5 their kitchen exhaust make noise like any any road construction be go on the bad part some of the room in their Gazania Block be on their Poolside kitchen face Very Pathetic noise and view 6 food menu have limit option and not up to mark as per their pricing 7 nee to carry your own water bottle else you will be dehydrate they do n t even bre water bottle in 1 5 to 2 hour 8 our one of package be misplace from their lobby while check Inn i complain but our company organise an outing to this place where we stay for a night they have good premise to host a party for a 100 crowd buffet place and ample room their food be delicious tidy room and swimming pool Everyone enjoy u get ta go there Hospitality be at the top of their list of thing to do Food variety in their restaurant be superb Swimming pool be the large i ve ever see but no diving Hotel security be most reassuring with agent constantly patrol Area be a huge high walled rectangular formation with lovely garden walk and feature numerous kind of croton and tropical tree some 150 room and 300 guest can easily be accommodate it a long way from the airport and a Metered taxi be a must take about an hour more during

discuss food i have see room be stack along a 800 m rectangular perimeter the middle area have dense plant and coconut tree at the top follow by a huge pool and end with a restaurant there be many team from different company for training and all the area be crowd room be luxurious Could not see many family with kid or couple i stay at the golden Palm as a part of my team outing the place be certainly not worth the hype around it and the price be just too high for what they have to offer Breakfast at the restaurant a dead fly be stick on the bread with many oth fly around 0 for hygene the infrastructure look old and slightly run down i would seek to go to a well place and not there for the price they be charge we go for drink on the pool side restaurant we order 100 piper 12 year full bottle as we be 7 people they ask for 8500 r Original price of this bottle be 1600 r they count per peg 30 ml price multiply by 25 peg and give us this rate we inform HONOURABLE MR KRISHNAN the Manager at the hotel he say he could give in 3000 r if we inform them by email but without inform by email charge bottle would be 8500 r what a rubbish answer and rubbish management system they then referrre us membership plan we be ready to take membership also which be worth 9000 r but then on this bill they do n t want to give membership discount they simply here to loot people Such a rubbish management policy highly non recommend this property it be the amazing experience at golden palm resort i have be there to attend a destination wedding the aura of the resort be wonderful the amenity of the resort be well maintianed and love to use the same the food quality be good and many variety of restaurant be available in the resort it be a amazing experience at hotel Swimming pool and Bar be a great to watch beautiful scenery i be book in Room 198 on first floor i be part of group of more than 20 people the room have excellent pool view i will say it be nice but somehow i do not feel that warmth Everyone work mechanically though efficiently but the feel of human touch be slightly miss maybe due to huge party that they be organise the food be nice in their coffee shop the big precaution one should take be that if one be sit in the balcony please ensure that the door to balcony remain open otherwise you will be lock in balcony and any help will be at least 25 minute away you have to shout to draw attention of any passerby who will then inform the reception the person will then take some time to come as it be fairly large complex i think this hotel be not disable friendly as no lift to go to first floor very co operative stop outside city and quite calm place to stay really love this place and a place where you can relax with family and burn the stres out it have lot of greenery around and be a good place to have some spa therapy use the amenity Good sport activity and relax stay really love this place and a place where you can relax with family and burn

not that good its a huge luxurious place with a huge swimming pool there be many facility both indoor and outdoor game there be a lawn tenni court as well the ambience and the facility be excellent the place be out of the city limit and the approach to the property be not very good you have to travel inside about 2 km from the main Tumkur road on wind road pass thro industry and village once you be inside the property it a totally different world and experience Cost wise it be on the high side and not for the regular visit the place be huge and good but some staff like their sport incharge do not have professionalism the billiard table be all tear up the TT bat be tore the long tenni court have no marking the sport incharge be not available in the sport area where he have to be stay for 1

Actor Sanjay Khan this resort have one of the big swimming pool in India with a Studio themed Bar and nicely landscape garden and plus greenery this property be surely one of the good resort in Bengaluru for both Family and Business Trips the variety of food they offer during the breakfast lunch and dinner be just awesome this resort have one of the good equipped gymnasium i have ever visit will recommend this resort for a short weekend stay on a week long or a month long busines trip firstly have never be to a resort with such a huge pool the resort be well maintain the room be have good ambience though the food breakfast lunch on expensive side i would say its definitely worth your money for what they be offer we have be for a day stay outing on a Sunday and overall it be wonderful experience and day well spend very friendly and cooperative staff place be well maintain Food quality be too good worth the money Well experienced Spa personnel and well equipped gym but some service have to be improve the food be serve in Golden palm Quality of resort be also good but the staff do not have hotel management etiquette sport and Swimming coach think themselves as bos of the place and treat very badly they have define their own set of rule and want every one to follow that i visit Golden Palms Bangalore in May 2017 for a 3 day Corporate program its list as a 5 star 4 star property on all travel website but its actually not worth than anything more than a 3 star property i find it quite overrated why STAY Stay for the beautiful compound with nice garden and huge pool area why not STAY the room be quite average Multiple Power cut be there though it restore soon key be not work twice during my stay Reception be very far from the room so you have to wait if you order for any service for room Entire hotel be on duplex concept so spread across a large area OVERLY PRICED the hotel look lavish on website but once you stay you will realize its not value for money FOOD Restaurant option be there but food be not great Breakfast be still good DINING RECEPTION AREA the seating area be good Furniture be nice HOTEL facility in room you have a TV Wifi for 1 device Fridge Safe Iron Board without iron Hair dry standard shower dental kit etc the interior lighting of Room be quite average oth FACILITIES the hotel have a Gym and Swimming Pool the Pool side be huge with a bar ROOM SERVICE Room Service be slow FINAL GIST if you be look for a great 5 star experience then this be not a smart choice but if you be look for a spacious property spread across huge area with garden and pool Isolated room then it be a good choice one good thing be that they have multiple auditorium and big board room so it can be consider for team stay or corporate programme but please do not have much expectation from service or the room when i step into Golden Palms Hotel with my family i leave one world behind very nice place to stay in Bangalore the space be breezy pleasant and peaceful feel like an oasi of peace in a busy City in evening if you sit near pool side you will love the ambiance around the staff be very friendly and more than willing to help you they make my family feel at home while be far away from home room be specious comfortable quiet and clean i simply love the food here love the place and highly recommend a stay there one of the good

swimming pool food at mynt masala club to host my client for stay and entertainment Excellent accommodation well appoint room fantastic service Convenient location subject to the vagary of the Bangalore traffic situation Spacious room and balcony Green everywhere can t think of anything negative i be write this review purely base on my experience at the Jiva Spa i have call the spa earlier in the week to book a couple massage for my spouse and myself i have clearly ask if we be able to use the pool post the massage as we want to just relax by the pool the person i speak to say yes this be complimentary and can be use by us after we get to the spa and complete our massage which be great i go to the front desk person and she say she be unable to accommodate us and we have to pay to use the pool i tell her that we would n t have book the massage if that be the case Someone from their team have clearly tell us at the time of the booking that we would be able to use the pool for free and now they want to charge us for it after a long conversation with her where she keep say that the pool be chargeable and someone give us the wrong information she finally agree to let us use the pool but it be really annoying that she keep mention it be chargeable even though we explain to her what have happen she should have give it to us complimentary and look within her team to understand why this happen instead of argue with us finally we be able to use the pool and receive really good service from the attendant there i think his name be Rupak Overall this have the potential for a great experience but sadly one person attitude at the Spa change this for us i recommend for a relaxing stay inside a capital city i guarantee there will be Pleasant stay here

courteous staff and prompt response to service the staff especially Gulshan have be very good the breakfast have also be decent Good location if you be visit for busines purpose i have to be in Bangalore for 1 week last month and after a lot of search and contemplate i finally decide to choose this hotel for my stay i have visit one of the restaurant in this place previously so be aware of the property now the hotel be be consider to be the one of the good if not one of the most expensive hotel in Bangalore it a pure luxury to be a part of Taj Hotels around the world i ve visit and i expect the same from Taj West End Bangalore as well unfortunately the experience be sub standard much much below my expectation i would say that after stay there for 2 day i know i m not go to be come here again the staff at the reception be good i check in pretty late around 11pm and be greet with a smile throughout the room they allot be good however only the next day i realise that it be one of the farth from the reception lobby area they have buggy service which be available on your call which be very convenient i call in for room service the same night order a Chicken Caesar salad and be surprised to see the quantity they serve with respect to the cost they charge not at all impressive Night go well they have comfortable bed and pillow and the room be clean and of good size First morning i go into the bathroom to my surprise i realise that there be no basic health faucet in the bathroom this be a shock an Indian Hotel do n t have the basic hygiene faucet in the bathroom the problem go on when i realise that there be no hot water but only warm which also take 5 minute to flow i complain to the house keep and ask them to get it check throughout the day i be out after my return i check with the housekeeping they say it have be correct Next morning again the same thing only warm water and no hot water again i complain same evening i check with a person who be walk there from the house keep department i show him the problem he say i ll have to wait for 10 minute for the hot water to flow from the tap really wow Taj West End wow try this technique the next day waste a lot of water for 10 minute and then hot water start flow what a trick but really at the cost of waste so much water i do n t think so i complain to the house keep again for the 3rd time i know by this time that nothing be go to happen and this be how it be here i ask for a room change but there be no room available as i be tell the IPL cricket team have occupy almost all the room and oth room be preboked so i have to be in the same room the housekeeping be probably aware of this problem and so be the hotel but they be still function with room like these Special thank to Emalaya and another gentleman from the housekeeping team who help me inspite of all these problem i face after the 3rd night i experience some mosquito in the room as well ask for the repellent and it be send in time be a relief in Room dining food as i mention above lack quantity but be tasty the breakfast on the oth hand be a disappointing spread the staff present there be good and helpful however the option to eat for a non vegetarian be very limited even for vegetarian i do n t see a big spread cheap hotel that this serve a big spread of breakfast in the end the stay be not comfortable and not at all worthy of the money i spend there and it be communicate to the staff at the reception while check out i ask them to email me the invoice bill which they still have n t after remind them again by call them personally last week as well in no way i m go to visit this Taj Property again i ve have much much well experience at oth Taj Hotels throughout oth place but this one be surely go to be off

Papaya salad be nice but nothing like what you get in Vietnam or Thailand please note its very expensive and overpriced but nice this be my 3rd or 4th time visit the Taj West End for pleasure and it great 23 acre in the heart of Bangalore set this place apart it an oasi in the middle of all the hustle and bustle the staff be great and the food have be outstanding highly recommend not 5 star but 6 star a hotel over the year know for its classic service standard and its ambience by far be the BEST in Bangalore its lung space and green cap Room positioning be watchful and check at the time of your check in and ensure you stay away from room thats close to banquet area be it the banquet hall especially the lawn they will bother you and irritate you as its extremely noisy all through the day and till close to midnight as and when event be around not consider the decibel level towards resident guest comfort level not to give a mis to its Jiva Spa and the choice on its treatment the product be use be amazing and top notch the choice on its food outlet be good though i recommne Blue Ginger which be the good and its ambience be wonderful with good service too after 3 5 day of travel from the US include miss connection and rerouting the Taj West End be exactly what i need this be not your run of the mill hotel the room be large with beautiful dcor and very comfortable furnishing the

satisfy this be a spontaneous decision to spend a mini holiday with the family at the Taj Westend i have visit before just to have a coffee and realise that the setting and facility be of a very high standard we have a family suite and find it to be ideal for the four of us Close proximity to the beautiful pool area and within the lush greenery of the 20 acre site all of the staff be extremely welcoming and nothing be too much to ask i also have a specific mention for the Mynt Restaurant Manager Ravi who go out of his way to make sure we be look after during our lunch time meal at the hotel

restaurant food and service be excellent their too we love our stay and will be back again lovingly restore maintain this old colonial building be home to the good hotel in Bangalore Lush greenery shade screen the hotel off from the unpleasant annoying pollution of the concrete horror know as Bengaluru Legendary Taj service exquisite cuisine burnish enhance the escapist experience hat off i stay at the Taj West End in April 2019 and regrettably i be only there for less than 24 hour and do n t have an opportunity to tour the beautiful ground that be say i love every minute at the hotel prior to arrive at the Taj i have stay in a 5 star western hotel in Delhi and while that be also great it be miss the rich cultural touch that i experience here right from the moment we arrive we be treat like special guest the hotel be around 125 year old and the building be grand and beautiful they just do n t make place like this anymore the food at the Indian restaurant be absolutely delicious as be the breakfast buffet the following morning it not a cheap place to stay but you get what you pay for and i would happily return to the Taj again at the time of my next visit to India the hotel be beautiful the staff we so attentive nothing be too much trouble the dining be excellent at the different location the spa treatment be relax with a wide range of treatment available the ground be outstanding an oasi of calm and a pleasure to walk through and see turkey goose and chicken i really feel embarrassed the way they treat me and my colleague while check in the room i request you to change those people who be sit in the front reception i have spend Rd 65000 which be not worth Superb place to stay visit while in Bangalore it feel like a different world by just step into this place also their coffee shop have some great thin crust pizza Great ambience conveniently location Fantastic experience we spend two night here Nothing be too much trouble all the staff from cleaner to manager be clearly highly train to deliver the most amazing and personal experience this be a reason to stay at a Taj hotel our club room be spacious and well decorate with every luxury spotlessly clean if we go again something i would love to do i would choose a room with a balcony although you could sit outside the front of our room 1103 Pool be great one pool be be use for a wedding but this be not a problem Club room be small but really good wine in their happy hour Food at the Mynt be excellent Good breakfast buffet we be on a half board basi this appear include 1600 rupee towards either lunch or dinner and on a Saturday the buffet all the food be really good there be no need to spend more if you choose not to Great service at the airport from the staff who greet you to the lovely man who ensure we safely check in and find our way to immigration this be part of the one way car service in club room it be so good we decide to use the same service on return to the airport Do the heritage trip at 5 pm every day well informed staff with lot of interesting history Love the way the garden and building have be maintain Worth around wander to see the bird and some of the amazing tree this be just a five star experience form start to finish there would not be any precise word to describe the Beauty of the Hotel one of the Best Heritage Hotels i have ever stay and what more it in the Hands of Taj Be it the stay the dining the Ambiance and the beauty of the Hotel everything be just mesmerizing my most favourite destination in Bangalore Experience of my recent stay at the picturesque Taj West End Bangalore be a testimony of all the positive that have be post write earlier about this hotel and my five star rating be an endorsement of Taj hospitality their busines ethic employees commitment and dedication towards service even situate on one of the busy area of Bangalore the hotel bring resort kind of feeling with sprawl campu lot of greenery laidback environment etc even the two function that be hold in their ball room during our stay didnt disturb the tranquility of the hotel and comfort of the resident guest all oth quality feature of the hotel have already be highlight by the oth reviewer hence no point repeat them what prompt me to mention Tatas busines ethic Taj be part of Tata be the fact that a vast piece of twenty acre of land in the highly price commercial area of Bangalore be be use to run a hotel with just 117 room just imagine the paltry return on value of capital employ from any standard busines thinking this property could have be monetize in a number of way or at least a new high rise wing could be construct to add capacity but it be the Tatas busines ethic that they be not only preserve the heritage value but maintain it at the cost of los of revenue and off course profit the hotel start in 1887 and original structure be still intact with not much structural change in oth area as well after Taj group take over it in 1984 the only change that have be effect in the building be only to add guest facilitate and comfort i really appreciate this philosophy and principle of Tata and Taj Last but not the least thank for all the employee of Taj west end for make our stay comfortable and provide all the medical help to me it be their dedication and willingnes to go extra mile for guest comfort that have make me a Taj loyalist it be a luxury hotel with excellent service expensive yet give value for money with affectionate staff everywhere in the Hotel which should be experience enjoy while stay fond memory recall often we stay in Taj Westend from 14th to 16th March we enjoy the lovely ambience and the landscape it be unbelievable that in the hustle bustle city of Bangalore can have such a peaceful property Visit to Blue Ginger Vietnamese Restutant be memorable the great Hospitality of Mr Sarvanan touch our heart we be vegetarian be reluctant to try the meal in this restaurant but to my surprise the Chef Mr Vairamuthu prove us wrong by treat us with fantastic preparation of vegetarian dish his magical and creative combination of menu bring us on next day also in this Resturant he be an asset to your organisation Courteous Mr Krishna who take us on Heritage tour need special mention Keep it up this spirit wish you all the good Dr Chandrashekhar chandrashekhar 54 yahoo co in the hotel must ve be quite good earlier but seem wear out and have that look as well in the interior give the high rate and rate for pretty much everything separately it not worth the buck to be pay for they pretty much charge for everything and anything which oth regular 5 star hotel have as a given include their group hotel elsewhere Stay if you have extra money to burn not a big unique experience to come back and tell story about this be the most stunning hotel with extensive ground original building now the spa Hindu temple and two swimming pool the room be spread about the beautiful ground

with a beautiful cake Thank you Taj West end for this awesome stay and experience this hotel go out of its way to ensure personal delight in almost everything the staff be endearing and caring an old heritage property that be set within its own botanical garden be a delight for anyone who love nature the gym and sauna room be well appoint the renovated room super modern yet preserve the heritage a perfect place for a getaway my first room have no window and no desk for me to work at but a comfortable bed and a nice windowless bathroom my second room have window and a desk but a bed fit for a student dorm and a bathroom so old and stain that i could n t bear to shower in it in my attempt to avoid that manky tub shower i book a treatment at the spa intend to use their shower facility instead this hack work very nicely and i discover that in fact the hotel spa be outstanding the rest of the time i make do with a sponge bath which really do n t cut it for India both room i stay in at this property be tired stain scratch and uncomfortable i want to stres all the room be spotlessly clean this be not the fault of the housekeeping staff but the room be old knock about stain and past it the windowless room have fake window set in the wall which be totally blur out with some sort of glaze which mean you feel very closed in and the room have almost no natural light see the photo which be take at 10 am on a sunny morning the decor in my second room be straight out of the mid eighty neither room be even close to 5 star standard nor worth the high price tag the staff be lovely helpful and personable it not their fault the property be be let to run down with no re investment into it this really should be a proud historic flagship hotel in Bangalore but it a shadow of its form self and barely functional for a busines traveler my back ache after have to work at a coffee table in the room with no desk and be bad when move to the room with a desk but a dreadful bed i can not recommend it my family and i stay at the Taj West End hotel for approximately a week and a half my child be 8 6 and 4 so i be understandably concerned about the cleanlines of the hotel and the safety security of the property i have no such concern shortly after arrive the property itself be safe and secure and quite clean they take great step to keep the ground clean and safe and there be security at the gate 24 hour the room themselves be clean and neat and locked etc but i have to say it be the people there that make this one of the good hotel in which i have stay from the moment you arrive to when you leave they be there to help make your experience at the hotel and outside the hotel better and they be amazing with my kid who they take the time to meet my aunt and uncle in their 80 also treat with great respect anyway i can only say that it be a wonderful stay and i would recommend this place with no qualification whatsoever and i would say thank you to Venkatesh Farzana Taj Sarala R Mohan Singh Mohan Mohammed Pinky Dimple Aathira Swetha and Majappa just a few of the people i meet while there well keep and maintain in traditional manner it have be give the nostalgic look of yesteryear each an every space outside room have be naturally maintain since year and give a very natural forest kind habitat within city what an elegant place Beautiful old building with lovely ground the staff could not have be more attentive without be at all obsequious our room be large and delightful with all the usual amenity the food we eat only various Indian speciality be of a very high quality and this be maintain in the wide and excellent choice at breakfast this would be our choice when we revisit Bengaluru simply wonderful experience from start to finish the bustle of the Bangalore traffic melt away as soon as we drive in the gateway of the Taj the staff be pretty special in their care and attention of the guest and the accommodation be excellent Race course across the road and a golf course next door what more could you ask of a major city hotel we spend such a good time at the TAJ at least 10 year ago This hotel be really fantastic room be very confortable park be exceptional Unfortunately it look like the organization of wedding company party be a priority to management it would be OK if it be not almost each day Several night we could not sleep before 1 AM due to extreme deafening techno music Techno be the only choice you get even if you be in your room at the opposite of speaker you must have a strong heart to survive In the evening they ask you if you wish to move in a different room because of night party i do not see what could make it well the speaker be so powerful it be like you be attend a techno live concert since from 5 50 be the park start to wake up bird employee car truck etc it be definitely a short night when you must work on next day it happen that you could be send off from the swimming pool because they have to prepare a party for a company it be obvious that hotel guest have become a plu it be no longer a priority the price of room be consequent it be not normal to be face this kind of today concern with a bit more hotel customer focu there could be many way to satisfy both kind of customer i stay with my husband and elderly mother for a lovely long weekend away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore the setting be stunning and so peaceful the service be excellent a good variety of food and beverage and the great amenity a great spa for example a fabulous weekend and we be look forward to return Wonderful heritage property nestle in a fantastic garden in town centre one get lose among exotic tree old charming building and photo portrae the lose grandeur of the British era unfortunately my room a standard one have n t be check properly recently so i find an enormous Beatle wander around the bathroom the telephone in the bathroom fall from the wall as soon as i touch it and all the situation there look definitely dismal i complain and i have to say that quickly room service take care of all the direction regret the inconvenience i face in every possible way but for such a mythical place this performance be simply not adequate Delicious on the contrary the Indian restaurant that serve menu a la carte i stay at the property for 2 night and have a memorable experience the

even the property be in itself a heritage property and a beautiful retreat and totally rejuvenating experience cheer to TWE once again have stay at this property for a weekend i would say this be a resort in heart of city Someone will not feel that he be stay in a busy city hotel the staff and the service be par excellence thank to front office manager Mr Ranjit to take extra care of us a gem in the garden City and will visit again for sure after stay with some good taj hotel and resort we decide to stay here a mistake the location be good and so be the outdoors but the room be really old and the bathroom be not well maintain the fixture be really bad and do not work the room service be bad and be not interested in serve us have ask for ice ice pack for an injury the ice come only after i walk to the reception in pain the staff also be least interested to help you with the taj membership related issue probably they should not run membership for this place there be oth good hotel in Bangalore please stay there and avoid stay here for your own well being because god only know how fast read slow the emergency service will be no tajnes experience at this place really disappointed we be at this property last weekend and love its quaint Victorian charm here be some pro and con we would like to mention Pros we love the eclectic blend of a high ceiling colonial style room with a modern bathroom the room we be give in the heritage wing be comfortable well light and have adequate storage space the check in proces be handle very efficiently by Kunal who escort us to our room and share a bit of the hotel s history along the way the man and woman at Masala Klub take very good care of us particularly Siddhi and Naveen these kid truly exemplify what we have come to know as the Taj hospitality similarly Farzana and the gang look after us very well at breakfast on both morning Cons perhaps the reading light could be in the form of adjustable lamp next to the bed instead of up on the ceiling this make the reading experience more personal without disturb the oth occupants s while come down for breakfast yesterday morning we find a heap of garbage just below the staircase clearly someone be clean the place and then leave without finish the job not a sight one would expect to see in a Taj property and finally what disturb us the most be not one but two instance of loud and completely drunken guest around us this be at Masala Klub on Saturday night and make us extremely uncomfortable the great service and delicious food could have make for a remarkable experience but for the above Overall we have a nice time thank mainly to the personalized attention from the staff and a lovely room i always like comme back to Bangalore and to get another oppertunity to stay at Taj West End the atmosphere be amung the good and it feel like a private sanctuary in the middle of the city surround by the tree that drown out the noise of the street outside i also enjoy the breakfast and dinner at Mynt be they always make you feel welcome and do their good to accomodate any request a big thank to the team at Mynt Authira Venkatesh R Mohan Farzana Preethi Chef Karthik Giri Swetha look like the Hotel be still in the Victorian style as far as the facility be concern for traditional Indian traveler bath room be a place where certain facility like health faucet in addition to toilet tissue should be instal for bathing bucket and mug be essential especially for senior citizen for whom operate the shower and adjust the hot and cold water directly from the shower faucet be not a very comfortable experience there be no tap to check the temperature of water before hand the bath tub be too high for people with knee problem to step into nee more disable friendly ramp all around wherever step be provide the positive factor be the ambiance and the friendly staff who be ready to attend to every requirement include arrange an emergency medical help at midnight it be a pleasure to stay amidst the greenery and resort like atmosphere over all it be a great experience too too good ambience food room hospitality good place in Bangalore 100 value for money superb stay cation package Spa be mind blow Greenery be top notch you never feel your in Bangalore pro centrally locate Spacious Rooms Delicious Food Excellent Staff Cons Food be tasty but service part nee

at Taj West End this be one of our favorite vacation spot in India and its only a 45 minute drive from where we live we love the feeling of peace and tranquility that come over us each time we enter the main gate of Taj West End instantly distance ourselves from the chao of the Bangalore street the highlight for us be the jungle garden that surround this historic hotel the exotic food and set at the Blue Ginger restaurant and the amazing hotel staff that welcome us back on each visit each time we stay we get to know a few new staff on the next visit we meet a few more now whether we go for a meal or stay the night so many of the staff remember us and they each go out of their way to welcome us and make our visit special Its the small thoughtful gesture by staff that set this hotel experience apart from other on one visit the head gardener see that we be admire the plant and take us on a tour of the garden and his nursery where the plant be grow another gardener see us visit the temple on the back side of the property and give us a few flower to give as an offering to the temple one of the dining room staff give me her phone charger to use during my stay because i leave mine

nice they be quiet clean tastefully decorate bed and pillow be very comfortable with excellent view of the garden bathroom modern and high quality on par with oth hotel of this clas and the good toiletry available Forest Essentials but its not the quality of the room that keep us come back its the overall experience of the people place and food Do n t just take my word try it out for yourself

staff the staff at the breakfast in Mynt restaurant take care of you like a family member Vantakatesh in particular superced everyone i enjoy my breakfast when he be around he would exactly know what your look for present in the good possible manner we nee more people like him in the service industry keep up the good work Venkatesh you be an inspiration for us all the people who work around u we be there at a lunch party in the Blue Ginger outdoor area our guest regularly stay there and we have always admire the property as a unique example of heritage comfort in the middle of the city this time the venue the catering arrangement the food quality and the music be to expectation which be high when one come to this hotel what definitely need improvement be the quality of service at the bar one have to wait approximately 15 minute to be serve the bartender be do sterling work why could reinforcement not be assign when the demand increase the dining area have no napkin although one be procure later be a guest suppose to go from counter to counter beg for a napkin although previous experience have be positive i feel that the quality of people very grim and cheerless as well as the number of service personnel assign be quite inadequate and show a lack of efficiency that i have not see earlier they happily sell room even if extremely loud bas dance music noise will be a problem because they book private party at their outdoor restaurant i have be call the Front Desk since 10 pm to see if they can reduce the noise to a reasonable level and its now midnight and there be no sign of the noise go down Hotels excuse we be try to call you earlier in the evening to let you know that there will be a private party we put a memo under your door to let you know Front desk staffs response party music WILL go on until 1 am and there isnt anything we can do about that their solution for tonight we can give you a sleeping room that be quieter but actually there be a private party and loud music problem last night as well Its perhaps a matter of personal taste but i could have endure better if it be music with some class my room feel like shake because its just heavy bas drum bang dance music with people clap and scream so if you want to take a chance of not be able to sleep or if you be willing to get move to another room in the middle of night choose to stay at this hotel otherwise stay away besides its facility be show sign of age and traffic around here be horrible Everything seem so calm soothing relaxing crisp and fresh about this place extremely good hospitality serve with a smile seem to be the motto of the entire staff and especially the team at buffet breakfast Pin drop silence in the city midst be a luxury we can not afford to mis the room here offer that silence with lot of greenery all around you Great food and a wonderful stay the Taj West End Bangalore be a 125year old treasure that know the true value of service in this increasingly un caring digital age where you be package stamp and send on your way without a thank you or a smile if you value old world charm and service there be always someone to Look after you at teh Taj West End somewhere that be a green oasi in a busy world this be my second review of this restaurant and the first after the recent renovation in Nov 2018 at this restaurant i continue to maintain that for a great fine dining experience food variety north south indian continental Mynt at Taj w end be one of the good option in Central Bangalore this be an excellent place for formal or informal get together with colleague friend or family with recent renovation the restaurant have become more spacious and yet it retain the same warm and inviting feel the renovation have not impact the overall layout and the greenery outside so the restaurant still open out to the idyllic beautiful garden the menu have a great variety of both vegetarian and non vegetarian across breakfast lunch brunch high tea and dinner and the staff and chef accommodate special request also the service quality be also one of the good with very cordial and attentive staff Thank you to Venkatesh Farzana Tilakan Mohan Aathira and the entire team at Mynt for the kindnes and hospitality show to me whenever be there at your restaurant the Taj hospitality remain unmatched and unparalleled our dinner at the Blue Ginger be so memorable right from the walkway light up with candle to the flower petal everywhere which by the way both my husband and i have a fun time throw on each oth to the delicious meal specially curate for us our sincere compliment to the Blue Ginger chef the high tea at Mynt be so delicious we love the roast tenderloin sandwich and i wish i have order more of the fish fingers We enjoy walk on the ground for a cinephile like me it be pretty exciting to know this be one of the site for a Passage to India i wish there be some image show the shoot in progres and walk across the garden where Sir Ronald Ross be know to have discover the cure for Malaria i mean wow we be really take in by how well the ground be maintain and how green the garden look we will definitely be back for many more short break i just have one piece of feedback about our room thank you to the Taj for upgrade us however the room while so beautifully put together feel a bit claustrophobic since the window do not open to a view and it get quite warm during the day also our mattres be too soft and give my soon to be middle age low back some ache and pain apart from this we love the Taj experience and will keep return for more no matter how long you stay no matter which Taj you stay in the service provide be impeccable the decor be fantastic the room be lovely and cozy and if its for a special engagement they really go out of their way to make you feel special Experience of Taj be one of a kind look forward to more experience in Taj my wife and i celebrate our anniversary on June 2018 here the room give to us be very so so it have a wierd odor the breakfast be excellent we love the service of R Mohan who show us warm and friendly South Indian hospitality i would just go there for the food and people like R Mohan Clone him please beware of the check out rule we get charge extra without information unlike TAJ but like everything else even TAJ be change they be polite enough to charge be and we leave feel cheat this be a green oasi in the heart of chaotic Bangalaru we have a comfortable stay in a perfectly pleasant room with perhaps a rather small bathroom Breakfast and lunch by the poolside be delicious mar in a minor way bynthe hungry backdoor who insist on take the bread from our table my wife be lightly shock but the whole incident be handle so solicitously by management that it really become a non issue perhaps the presence of a falcon occasionally may deter the plucky bird another great brunch where Mohan and venaadesh do a very good secure a perfect experience sit outside and listen to the life music make a great atmosphere the buffet be very nice and both serve western and Indian food Champagne and drink be include and all of high quality Look forward to the next visit a great place to stay and celebrate any occasion that one may have could n t have ask for a well experience and the entire team make extra effort to make our stay and experience really memorable we be here for a wedding and everything about this property be just amazing we have a great experience stay here the catering by the hotel be excellent good food i ve have we be really pleased with our stay the staff be very polite and helpful the pool be great as well Taj West End be one of the good property to stay at Bangalore you be in the heart of Bangalore yet

even after provide valid i d proof the person mention incorrect name Mistake correct and the person be nice enough to upgrade us to a suite we have book a luxury room Room the room be quite ordinary heritage should not translate to shabby with old look furniture and less than comfortable bed Have see well bed in much less hype hotel Balcony have an unpleasant rot garbage smell the room itself have a very strong Jasmine smell possibly to cover up the bad odor the bath tub spew dirty yellowish water on the 2nd day of our stay and the resolution the staff give be let the dirty water run out do not touch the tub again while there Pic attach Dining breakfast spread be good but the service be too slow due to the crowd of people Should have be handle consider the luxury price but sadly Taj do not live up to it for the birthday i have order a cake to be send on midnight between 2nd and 3rd Dec the cake be place in the room on 2nd 11 am and the surprise be spoilt Concierge have also ask for some pic to be place out of 3 only 2 pic be place and the 3rd one be ignore one of the pic place be a portrait mode but be place rather clumsily in a landscape paper frame very inconsequential item but i gues Taj do not have portrait frame so should not have expect it the cake be not deliver on the midnight and i have to call them to send it over the guest service phone line person be always in a hurry to just transfer the call to a different department check out on the 3rd and tell them a little bit about our problem staff be apologetic and do not charge us for an in room dining item but consider i want it to be a special experience in luxury it be not achieve and no amount of discount could make up for the bad birthday experience we have the good hotel of Taj a heritage

it be definitely different from a standard modern hotel old historic building and lot of greenery around the staff be always polite and ready to help the hotel be not in a congested area which be great if you be look for some peace and quiet however this also mean that you be limit to eat only at the hotel restaurant no eating place within walking distance unfortunately there be several minor issue that culminate in a less than desirable stay the room be small the mattres be thin and the sheet have a hole in it i be guess housekeeping see the hole the next morning and replace it speak of

take away the extra roll the next day lead to another request use tea coffee cup be not replace clean either the final night see us wake up periodically from some strange noise come from the floor above us it almost sound like somebody be roll stone around we complain to the front desk and only receive we be sorry comment from 3 different people no effort be make to make thing right Most reputable hotel chain take the satisfaction of their guest seriously especially if pay INR 12 000 a night tax but this hotel seem happy with offer apology why ask how our stay be if you be not willing to addres the issue or make amend for the same a big shout out to the lady at MYNT i have skip lunch and request some cookie she go to the kitchen and get me some cookie as well as some banana and she refuse to take payment for the food Thank you we eat at all the restaurant and the quality of food and the service provide be excellent Overall leave a lot to be desire there be numerous reputable

there have not be adequate communication between the reservation department and the front desk regard our early check in which be however be very quickly and efficiently resolve we have nothing but friendly welcoming and courteous service as most of the staff be wonderful it seem unfair to single out individual however i feel compelled to do so as there be some who leave a lasting impression on us all the front desk staff be terrific but Irena and Yangden make such an effort to make us feel extra special to have take the trouble to make a personalise card for us be very touching and go well and over the call of duty Suman with his welcome smile and knowledge of the hotels history be always a pleasure to chat to the club lounge while be a bit drab and in need of modernise be make a relaxing venue by the like of Ravi and Kevin Breakfast at the Mynt could be a bit chaotic but Aathira ensure that we be well look after by the like of Mohan and Vasu we have some delicious meal at the Masala Klub where Chef Paramjeet ensure that we taste the good he and his team have to offer the food be outstanding lastly a thank you to Sukruti the duty manager who make the painful part of pay the

hotel Taj West End Bangalore 20 Acre property which have a fairytale touch to every nook and corner of it a week of absolute fun its not the modern day convenience that make this place standout its the people every person in that palace have a tailor make persona and passion which just elevate the experience they not only treat us well they treat us like FAMILY every day we get out be like take a stroll through our neighborhood a pricey neighborhood P but truly worth every penny if you visit this place you get to meet the follow people Athira Restaurant Manager Mynt a power pack yet amazingly jovial person who always have a sweet smile on her face and dark humor on her tongue do nt be fool by her pretty face she know the busines like a pro Mohammed and Srinivas these charming man can find and get you probably anything and everything you nee during the stay Sweta this cute tweety bird can be see fly around your table with a determined face often Minsomen and Giri Two very humble and patient guy s highly RECOMMENDED have stay in this property a few year back and though the property be top notch the service level especially at the front desk and restaurant be below Taj standard decide to take a chance last week and revisit the property we be impressed with the improvement all around and come back with many happy memory Special mention go out to the front desk personnel include the duty manager the young MT Kevin at the club lounge and graceful lady Sangita at the Vietnamese Resturant this be a real gem of a property make really special by the quality of personalise service by its staff one of the good property one could ever imagine it heaven in paradise one should certainly make this a destination for stay during travel to Bengaluru the overall ambience and environment be highly intriguing Taj West End could be a real gem match a colonial architecture with an aged elegance everything spread on an enchanting tropical garden it be a gem but there be some small issue that dont give it an outstanding ranking in term of hospitality there be not a full attention to detail start from some not fully care furniture in the common area and a not so perfect room cleaning service a breakfast buffet of average value with pastry not so fresh and a little bit of decadence you can smell somewhere i be a bit critical because it be one of the most expensive hotel in the city and it could surely improve a bit to fully honor its beautiful old time structure the room be wide and the bed very comfortable there be two nice swimming pool in the middle of the lush vegetation three restaurant one of this Masala Klub offer an high level Indian cuisine and oth amenity at the end the experience be positive the atmosphere be very pleasant considering that we be in the middle of a big city and the service level good but also it could be slightly more accurate it be our wedding anniversary and we want a luxurious stay and a quiet evening the hotel staff go out of their way to make sure that it be a memorable experience a very lively charming and hospitable young people who make up the front desk team i have already write my review over all nice stay thank to Kiran at the concierge and Junaid Vijay and Ravi at the butler Small eye for detail thing be miss Training need to give at the minibar guy who replenish the item our office have a conference and i be delighted it be at Taj West End where i have earlier stay and like it very much it maintain the same high standard of service and quality of room and amenity the ambience of the hotel be unmatchable and highly recommend for either Leisure or busines stay here on busines the room be great size the food be wonderful the ground be tropical and secluded Excellent service beautiful facility luxurious amenity all around a fantastic stay at the Taj West End a very relaxing and pleasurable trip the room be very clean and tidy the staff in the hotel reception restaurant and bar be extremely polite and welcoming a special mention for Mohammed in the concierge staff who be able to deal with a couple of issue for me i have IPL ticket book but they be deliver to the wrong addres Mohammed calmly explain that he would get the ticket and not to worry he do exactly as promise he be an absolute credit to the hotel all three restaurant be definitely worth a visit the price be obviously quite a bit high than around Bengaluru city but the quality of the food be first clas one disappointment be the extremely high cost of the laundry service 895 rupee 8 90 to wash a shirt seem absurdly expensive it would be cheap to go and buy a new shirt and tuck your dirty shirt in your bag till you get home Live history and rejuvenate at prestine beauty Taj Westend the hotel be an oasi of peace amdst the maddening traffic of Bangalore the cottage be surround by thick vegetation Enjoy luxurious swimming session at two pool move around in golf cart and enjoy surreal beauty of jungle right in the heart of city have be here for dinner with family to celebrate a birthday Have be here several time in the past and have enjoy the food but this time experience nothing short of a horrible dinner extremely disappointed with Chef Paramjeet who didnt cater to our request and deliver POOR QUALITY and TASTELESS FOOD both the starter and main course food be below standard of Taj when we order for flat bread Paranthas we wait and wait and be then inform that it be burn by the Chef and would take more time suffer with a stomach ache now because of the food we have there write this review so dinner could be plan elsewhere a high clas hotel with a unique atmosphere and dcor lovely tropical garden Great conference facility and service catering for both busines and private need Ideal location to restaurant and sightseeing without much traffic Staff be competent fast and efficient a stay in Bangalore make memorable thank to the hotel highly recommend for discern traveler overwhelm with the personal touch and care every need be take care of and preference never forget Imagine a footh massage awaiting after return forma hard day work it be so touching Floral rangoli as you step out for the day this hotel come highly recommend so despite the high cost i choose it for our accommodation whilst in Bangalore i be greatly disappointed for the money spend it be very underwhelming the good i can say be that the ground be beautiful the breakfast quite good and the service excellent R Mohan in particular be extremely attentive to our need the room be average and just comfortable enough there be a party go in the next room the second night we be there and you d have think it be on our porch i do n t know if because we have a corporate booking along with the need for two bed as it be just my daughter and myself if they give us what room they have available which may not have be a well room in the end if i visit Bangalore again the Taj West End wo n t be one of my first choice if location be n t as much a concern stay at the Taj Bangalore before i go into the negative i would like to point out the positive the tip KUNAL give us while check in to the TAJ WEST END the HERITAGE WALK at 5 pm after a slightly lengthy check in by KUNAL we be take to our room 1705 love the traditional TIKA by the young lady we be able to join the Heritage walk the same afternoon our guide SUMAN KUNDU do an excellent job of so proudly show us and explae us about the History of the Taj West End he be wonderfully pleasent knowledgeable patient with our group and very kindly explain and answer all our question after the most interesting hour spend with SUMAN we feel and understand that the first Taj Hotel we decide to stay in India be the correct choice during out two night and three day at the TAJ we take time to explore and enjoy all the beautiful nook and cranny and for this we be grateful to Suman for open our eye and heart to such an amazing Hotel we manage to have three meal at the restaurant MINT we love each and every curry during lunch and the breakfast be wonderful also during breakfast we meet a wonderful young man KHUS he make us feel special as he take time to chat with us we really think the room be beautiful but it lack a window from which we could look out if it be rain or sunny the separate dressing room and Bathroom be pretty and useful the negative part of our stay be that when i book our Room via makemytrip com i have pay for a LUXURY ROOM with a GARDEN VIEW we get the HERITAGE ROOM by the end of our stay we feel very suffocated and i feel to be hon a little cheated as i have expect that the staff would not be make such a mistake we really we re try after a long flight so we do not have the energy to move still i feel it be Hotel and the person who check us in or assign the Room to assign the correct category of room pay for by the guest i have learn my lesson and i will be more careful when i check into our second third so on and so forth visit to oth Taj property still just meet such a wonderful young man like SUMAN who be always most charming be a great Positive for us Taj Westend be not the typical hotel of the modern day it rich in culture and the sprawl property with it tree and greenery be such a great place to stay top with the Taj service Check in be smooth the room be luxurious and very well do with all comfort the bathroom be extravagant with their tub and shower the bed be comfortable they have two swimming pool and the kid pool be such a delight with the child the buffet breakfast have a large spread and not to be miss the Spa be good we arrive late on a Monday evening at the beginning of our south India tour the check in proces be very prompt and all the staff we encounter be incredibly helpful the room we have book we be a couple travel with my elderly mother be luxury room with their own little courtyard garden just a short stroll of a couple of minute from the main building they be really well appoint and quiet and the heritage detail be maintain beautifully the room themselves be spacious as be the bathroom and we do n t encounter any noise from the main building or from the city itself after we refresh ourselves we have a brief snack at the main restaurant which be all we could face after a long flight and the food be good quality and service be timely Breakfast the next morning be a good buffet selection of Indian and western food and again the service be good our only complaint be that we have so little time to enjoy the room and this beautiful heritage hotel we do not manage to see the ground or anything of Bangalore as we leave at 9 am we will just have to come back we be give a room which be not walk distance from reception we have to even ride a buggy to get to the room since the place be full of tree and plant there be mosquito around the room be standard and yet pricey Staff be not that flexible with request from guest we visit Blue Ginger in Taj Westend for celebrate birthday and we enjoy ambience and food very much the staff help us in choose the good Vietnamese cuisine Food be yummy and worth every bit money you pay for the ambience of Blue ginger be awesome there be a artificial lake and you can hear the water hum sound which be very nice a must visit place for food lover i be at this hotel right now 30th March and can confirm what the previous poster write the music from the Blue Bar be incredibly loud especially the bas and today be Friday it be impossible to sleep we complain a number of time and be tell by the reception that they would turn down the music which they do not do until our fourth complaint and say that the music would stop at 1230 1 it be still go at 1 30 am really well below expectation Avoid we plan a family getaway for Easter weekend Most people would go to a resort but we choose Taj Westend we make absolutely the right decision Its a beautiful resort in the heart of Bengalaru the warmth of the management GM Somnath Front Office Manager Ranjith Head concierge Mohammed and their team be exemplary the food be to die for Blue Ginger Mynt and Masala Club all great Kudos Chef Sandip Narang and F B head Sumit will be here back again for sure i have stay in the hotel now for 3 night and the room be lovely however on my last night i sit listen to a disco from the blue bar as if it be in my room i stay all over the world in hotel of this standard and high and have never be so disappointed as i complain twice which be out of character for me then i even ring the manager who say the blue bar manager have nt turn down the music even after several complaint and be ask i have to say at 12 29am in the morning this be very very poor this be a truly luxurious hotel with beautiful ground contain ancient tree so it feel like be in a rainforest the room be impeccable with every convenience at hand the service be superb and the various restaurant offer a vast range of multi cuisine food Would love to stay here again have visit Taj Westend Masala Klub Restaurant which serve Indian cuisine for our anniversary dinner which be the first choice of our daughter son in

be a part of the usual Taj experience we be pleasantly surprised by the spread and layout of the property it 125 year old and maintain beautifully i would rank it higher than Taj bekal only because this feel like a big and more spread out property and also Taj holiday village Goa coz the upkeep at Taj w end be way well Check in be really smooth by a very pleasant lady who please us with her choice of room for us the property be also home to a no of duck who just walk by you and be the cut little thing walk in one straight line there be also big huge turkey the food and service be

this hotel i eat all 3 meal at the hotel and the food be good the breakfast buffet be awesome the room could do with a little updating the property itself be beautiful lush green oasi in busy city the

Hospitality from Taj West End staff have be great my choice for future Bangalore visit my first time in Bengalore staff at the hotel super nice and helpful i stay at room at number 18xx its outside the hotel like a multiple cabin the only problem be that its close to the bar so you can hear all the music i do nt use the swimming pool but use the spa for a deep tissue massage and it be really good after 12h flight 6h conexion 10h flight my husband have stay here at least ten time over fifteen year on busines trip and i have accompany him on a couple of occasion it be therefore disappoint on check in that no one seem aware of our previous visit welcome back unlike oth hotel brand we stay in after our visit together in October 2011 we note in TripAdvisor We would definitely stay here again this time we be not so sure as definitely do not receive a good to have you as a guest feeling more as if we be a hindrance Most smile and greeting be from the cleaning and gardening staff Check in take a long time and several phone call for no reason we could ascertain but believe these be for people involve with an event happen at that time and we be finally show to our Taj Club room the bathroom be spacious and well lay out the actual shower however be not good the flexible one do not have a variable bracket mean it be direct straight at the face we manage to have small workaround with a bottle of shower gel the oth option be the overhead rain shower which be not great for those shower when you do not wish to wash your hair on the very good side the toiletry be vegan friendly now that deserve a gold star the bedroom be also spacious with a lovely couch table area and small chair in the window there be plenty of storage in the room from the large wardrobe but with only five hanger so have to request more to plenty of drawer the large picture window really brighten up the room and outside the door there be a great public cover balcony area overlook the Rain tree and small garden area it would be good to have an actual opening window though as the room can be a little stale when return if the a c and fan have be off all day the furniture be completely adequate but a little tired with scratch scar and burn mark on the top the bed be extremely comfortable with lovely linen and pillow Breakfast be include and this be in both the Myntt and Masala Klub and we often have an excellent masala omelette and Sweeta be a very good attendant we have a wonderful tasting menu dinner at the Masala Klub we select the one with only one meat dish and this be replace by prawn for me the quality of the food the taste and presentation be all excellent Shame that it take over twenty minute to make and deliver our two martini which we have want as pre dinn drink not with the first course we also order room service Masala Klub Tiffin twice one seafood and one Non vegetarian and both be very good and Ravikant our room service attendant be extremely efficient and friendly i only use one of the pool area and there be very few oth none one day guest there these may have account for the lack of service in the area unfortunately it be the lack of detail to attention that irk during a visit and remove the feeling of be in a luxury five star hotel the slow check in at reception the fact that we have to ask for two dressing gown for our room as none provide a lack of glass in the minibar only a couple of bottle of water all these be rectify although again for some unknown reason one of the dressing gown be remove upon the room make up the next day and the slipper disappear on our last day for some reason we realise on our third night want a beer that the minibar wasnt work correctly and therefore no cold drink again this be look at the next morning when request but have not be notice during the daily minibar check for what we have consume and it wasnt really cold by the next night after return to our room one afternoon neither of our key work not sure of the reason although be ask at reception if our bag have be collect yet on a couple of visit to the public restroom by the lobby toilet paper have not be replace in two of the three cubicle three time tray of food remove from room be just leave on stairwell for some considerable time not a great look it should also be mention that the Taj along with the majority of Indian hotel do host a lot of very large family wedding and oth anniversary so area of the hotel will from time to time be out of bound these event can comprise of loud music and at various time during our visit one garden area a restaurant and a pool be not available at various time to hotel guest one afternoon an event start to be set up around me by the pool force me to leave the area earlier than i have intend maybe the name should be change from Taj West End to Taj Function Hotel perhaps we shouldnt have have such high expectation from early visit but be definitely disappointed in the general service this time Shame my first trip to Bengaluru and choose Taj West end out of the 5 Taj property in the city its locate in one of the posh area of Bengaluru and i do n t know whether one should call it a hotel

most day go more than the normal extra mile we eat in all 3 restaurant and find that the Masala Klub suit us best in term of food quality sorbet on dry ice be a standout memory the quality of service and ambiance not that there be anything wrong with Blue Ginger or Mynt the staff be all so nice and its so difficult to remember all of the staff who assist us as it seem to me all of the hotel employee strive to ensure that they really do look after its customer however Fazarla in Mynt always take my wife around the buffet and together they select breakfast and then Fazarla would ensure my wife transfer from her wheelchair to a normal dining chair with care and devotion Savindra Suluman in Masala Klub be superb all the house keep team be great and lead by the wonderful Sarahs the front door team Vasanth in particular be enjoy his extra weight training who call for and assist in transfer to the golf buggy the concierge team Kiran Junaid be great Sumon who show supreme patience at the hospital it would be totally wrong not to mention Ranjith and Shawn the front office manager who ensure everything work thank to all we have a great time and would totally recommend the West End as a hotel since more than 29 year as an IT consultant i travel around the world and have live in more than 100 hotel for my busines trip however for the Taj Westend Hotel in Bangalore be the good i have ever be for me all what i expect as a busines traveller i have find see and experience in this lovely hotel the area i e the park around the hotel the building and room themselves old fashioned but inside up to date the service reception desk room service restaurant service the food itself and last not least the overall friendlines and helpfulnes of all the hotel personnel whenever i would get the next chance to travel to Bangalore busines or private the Taj Westend Hotel would be my first choice to book it in any case after do the normal tourist trip to Delhi and Agra which we thoroughly enjoy we go to Bengaluru to catch up with some old colleague that i have not see for over 20 year we choose this hotel as it be the one i use to use during my many busines trip although it have be many year since i have last stay there and it have be absorb into the Taj chain i be not disappointed Everything about the hotel be superb the staff be so very friendly and helpful in any way that they could this be not only the we be here to serve you attitude but one that seem genuinely intended yes there be less expensive hotel but there be none well in my opinion no high rise no ugly concrete structure its like stay in a resort in the heart of Bangalore in a 125 year old Taj property locate on race course road and sandwich between the race couse and the Bangalore golf club the hotel be perfectly locate amongst the green the height be limit to two floor the room be spread out in the 25 acre property situate ideally amongst tree and garden with chirping of bird in the morning we be stay in a block which have two floor with 8 room on each floor each such block have giant tree and lot of greenery surround it the hotel still retain the 125 year old block which be a originally a 10 room inn with horse stable there be a prince of wales garden where prince Charles visit in 1991 and some part of the movie a passage to India be shoot here the hotel staff be courteous and most helpful a mention be essential for two key human resource of the hotel Ms Ankita and Mr Abhishek of the front desk always go that extra mile to help us and make our stay memorable hat off to both of them Ive stay at this iconic property twice both time a relaxing experience in an oasi in the heart of the city i be tell this property be rate the good hotel under 5 star in the country i believe it three restaurant Vietnamese Indian and Multi Cuisine spa gym pool two clay tenni court busines center Taj club and ground that most botanical garden would kill for and bird many many kind of bird the room be old fashioned but comfortable Stay in the Frangipani wing and when the fig be ripe youll have fly fox outside your door every night Service be impeccable from check in to check out the West End will supply hospitality at its Indian warmest Pick your own herb and the chef will make a special dish with them just for you Take the 5 pm tour and realize that people can and do live here and immerse yourself in the history and see more bird i would recommend for busines or romance kid be welcome but its a bit pricey for a family holiday i go just for small party here as it be my friend birthday Everything be so freaking awesome i know Taj give a sense of Luxury but i go there and its true room and all stuff be kinda seem expensive but hey the same thing come again Taj if you really want luxury its a GOGO i have to Call 3 Different Phone No to Book the Complimentary Night Stay along with Paid Night Stay but the Staff do not Understand our Requirements the Discount Stature inform at the time of Member be Different they say that 10 Discount will be give to all room but when i call up for Reservation then all be different story Discount be give only to Rooms without Breakfast Many such Fraud discount so please my Suggestion not to Buy Inner Circle Member i stay at the Taj West End on a busines trip the Hotel be conveniently locate and be a 130 year old property build on 24 acre of land the check in smooth with smile staff all around i be upgrade to a suite and take by a golf cart to my room which be on the first floor the room be decent so be the washroom the glas panel on the the bath area be get old the Hotel really need to spend money on the upkeep of furniture fixture the toiletry be good though i have my evening drink in the executive lounge which have extremely limited bar menu with timing from 6 30 pm to 8 pm if i compare this with a tower room at ITC then this be certainly poor the bar menu at ITC be extensive with a timing from 6 to 8 pm so i be certainly disappoint with what Taj offer although Manoranjan there take good care of us we have dinner at their Vietnamese restaurant call Blue Ginger the setting and ambiance be superb and second to none we take the set veg menu and be happy with our choice Babu take very good care of us the breakfast again be disappointing with limited option and spread even the south Indian cuisine serve be not authentic the idli and wada be both poor i certainly expect better from Taj here the check out be also not great with the front desk say that they do not receive the money from our travel desk it take them some time to figure out the same but the staff be helpful overall a beautiful property with staff who be helpful and cheerful but could certainly do better hence the rating of 4 and not 5 Excellent hotel at a cost highly majestic excellent ambience food and service locate in the middle of city near to all visit point Excellent gym and spa facility with a large outdoor swimming facility this be our second stay here the hotel staff could not be more welcoming the room be spacious comfortable and charming the ground be beautifully landscape a perfect escape from all of the noise and traffic of Bangalore three restaurant dont mis eating at the Masala Klub Fantastic food and service i have be to India many time this be my first visit here and it have become one of my favourite Indian hotel unlike most in Bangalore it be a low rise group of heritage building set in a beautiful verdant garden of 22 acre it be a haven of peace in a bustling city the room be lovely most with balcony look into the garden and forest all facility be available include spa pool and tenni court the restaurant South Indian and Vietnamese plus multi cuisine coffee shop be very good but what be truly outstanding and memorable be the quality of the staff the concierge lead by Mohammed be outstanding among the good i have encounter anywhere in the world they be courteous efficient knowledgeable and willing to go out of their way to help guest i would single out Kiran who be absolutely brilliant Treat yourself to a few day here you wo nt regret it Blue Ginger never disappoint us they not only bre out fantastic food and drink but the staff ensure that the experience be special and memorable Sourabh and his team do a wonderful job once again highly recommend for someone look for good food with a personal touch of hospitality we stay at Taj West End for a week recently in the club room category accompany by our 6yr old daughter Sara its one of the fine Taj property true to its legacy the entire team be do a fantastic job to ensure the stay be perfect one of the most memorable one a great place for family kid with the rabbit park be of most attraction in addition to the

wish the entire team at Taj West End the very good congratulate them for the great show the reason i love stay only at Taj property be the service provide at Taj West End it be extremely personalized my wife and i be celebrate our 5th anniversary and be treat for a surprise cake cutting at the terrace this be follow by a private dinner sit at Blue Ginger one of the good Vietnamese restaurant in India the property be beautiful especially if you be travel with kid they also have animal like turkey rabbit duck geese on their ground thank to i like to specially thank Ankita and the front lobby team for the anniversary celebration also like to thank Suman for the amazing experience create for my 3 year old the multiple heritage walk on the property in the buggy and interact with the animal and good trip organize by Kiran who at the concierge make sure our Bannerghatta trip be hassle free what trouble me the bathroom in our room be bit of a nuisance be a heritage property the plumbing be not do properly the toilet have weird smell and the shower be not work the staff do change our room eventually to take care of this issue Hope they will proactively look into this go forward it be a beautiful property surround with lot of tree and plant feel like you be in a jungle the room remind you of of the colonial past Big room with great view the spa be a must visit they have a pond on the property and variety of dining option it be a wrong choice to dine at the Mynt Restaurant of the Taj West End i be take over a dozen relative out for dinner and we decide to savour the lung space offer by the open garden area of this hotel the reservation be confirm well in time some of my folk be Bangaloreans settle in USA so they remember the restaurant and they look forward to a lovely outdoor dining experience thing begin to go downhill from the time we arrive they seat us in a real corner of the verandah outside close to the service entrance for the staff of the restaurant be that the only option it neither look out anywhere nor be it a pleasant ambience the wine list take its own time come why yet eventually my guest feel the wine offer be not exciting so we mostly go with beer and juice for a restaurant that be half empty we wait for over 40 minute for just the drink and they come one at a time it be so frustrating be this really the way you serve for a 14 pax party at the Taj the starter we order be decent and come really fast after i speak my mind at the bar counter but the main course leave much to be desire in the taste department the lone tomato soup we order be a disaster the Mexican Pizza need to have a Mexican flavour hello which be miss and it be so full of corn i be also wonder if you can charge reasonably why isnt there a healthy option of wheat base pizza some of us order a mix of Indian dish and there be total chao when they start serve us the entire staff around our table look like rookie to me there be no coordination nor a method in the service no one know what the oth one be do or go to do it be hilarious Sample these nugget one side of the table get plenty of Indian bread whereas the oth side of the table just keep wonder if they would get serve at all some of the item get skip from be serve to the diner until we have to point to the empty plate i have order for the tasteless pizza yet a staffer keep ask me whether i would like to have Dal with Roti and when water at room temperature get over on the table one of them ask us if he could serve us chilled water also on our table say it be only little cold be it really that hard to quickly get a refill of water at room temperature where do you want to go with this what be you think and when we ask for the menu card why not hand over 2 or 3 so that the large group can choose easily maybe faster Deserts be just average Nothing gourmet here and lastly 3 people 2 reasonably healthy adult and 1 child complain that the chair we sit on be so uncomfortable that their back start hurt Someone need to do an ergonomic assessment of your sitter man what make me even more upset be that i have ask to speak to the manager of the restaurant there be no move from anyone to get him her over nor do anyone come and even check with me till i leave the restaurant maybe they forget i leave feeling that the place be get old past its prime take old customer for grant Common the least you want to do be to TALK to a miffed customer and i tell you i be an Epicure program member do n t i Overall really disappoint with everything at the Mynt the meal be not worth over 500 USD we pay just to compare i be stay and dining at the Lands End in Bandra a few week ago what a difference be you two different company once again i ve be at the West End Hotel in Bangalore enjoy its location atmosphere service and the always perfect welcome by the Chief Concierge who know me from long ago and be ready to assist me for any need moreover the season be wonderful a plu for my stay its a good hotel with a very cordial front desk we stay overnight in this hotel and love every bit of it only drawback be the food serve at the coffee shop we be run late so decide to have a quick meal at the coffee shop which be not at all up to the standard nor be its staff this hotel have so much charm it recall the old Victorian time when Britts where look for some comfort in some place that could give them the feeling of be back home the colonial style of the architecture could be compare to the Raffle in Singapore however the charm stop there the service be poor the food uninteresting and the room be run down this hotel deserve a complete refurbishing and a more efficient management what a pity do not seem to be worth the money they do not have prop stock of wine we have seek for we have to settle for an alternative we have opt for set menu for dinner the quantity of food be deplorable it be just not worth the money the hotel seem to be always in a renovation state their car parking nee not even be speak about a local hotel or bu stop would have well car parking facility this hotel be excellent hotel and good hospitality staff and service and food in breakfast be very excellent hot and very nice taste with good experience this area be very good for hotel and near many area to visit place also the Taj West End be a lovely oasi of green and luxury in the middle of the busy bustle of Bangalore our room be set in a delightful small building of about 8 unit nestle in tree and flower Birdsong be the accompaniment to our morning tea on our shady porch the main building with fine dining massage and sauna and more be an easy walk along path line with beautiful flower also if you have an issue of any kind the front desk and concierge staff be fully at your disposal to solve thing they could n t have be more solicitous and kind go way out of their way to make sure our stay be seamless and happy we love the Taj this be my first visit to the Taj West End and i have a wonderful 5 night busines trip stay my room be elegant and well appoint with a very comfortable bed and all amenity i eat in all three restaurant and the food be delicious

to finish we arrive in the very early morning and we warmly receive by the hotel staff say it be the middle of the day facility ground and amenity all first rate very positive first staff impression sustain throughout we eat at all restaurant on site all excellent a terrific introduction to India highly recommend stay only one night Lovely expansive property with large room it almost resort like in the middle of the city Would have be awesome for a family romantic holiday unfortunately i stay there on busines and the walk from the room to the reception and or restaurant be almost painful if one be in a hurry they do provide buggy to travel though there be a wait involve Will i stay here again definitely if travel with family on busines no locate in the centre of the city and have very calm and peacefull room be perfectly good indoor pool be good with coffee and tea counter Taj w end be one of the royal hotel in bengaluru stay here only 1 night for busines it be at the end of a whirlwind 5 city tour the hotel be an oasi in the middle of the city and feel very calming and peaceful enjoy dinner at the Blue Ginger walk the ground in the morning Breakfast outside on the verandah be awesome can not wait to go back for an extended stay 3 night stay in September as part of a tour around southern India Delightful hotel in its own extensive ground Lovely staff make us feel very welcome a real oasi in the heart of bustle Bangalore the property be lush green and transport you away from the maddening city hustle and bustle the entire team be wonderful and i would like to specially make a mention of the front office team Pinky ghosh and her colleague apology i do n t know the name of all exude warmth and make one feel right at home this be just the break we need and we would love to come back again our stay be most enjoyable and the garden in the hotel be simply fantastic Staff go out of their way to make our stay pleasurable and happy Look forward to spend some more time at the hotel next year congratulation to member of a great team of a great hotel we enjoy our stay and have a great stay overall we be pleased by the hospitality of each staff we like the food at their coffe shop the pool be very nice thank once again and would like to come back again the hotel be base in the centre of Bangalore and be locate on several acre of land room be spread out over several building my room be very spacious and have a great view of a garden the room itself have a large walk in wardrobe which be connect to the bathroom strangely enough there be no book about the hotel facility in the bedroom furthermore the work bench have a couch instead of a chair i gues this be perhaps Tata standard Check in be friendly efficient and as i be very early they even offer me breakfast very kind Overall reception staff be indeed very friendly and willing to help Breakfast be perfect with all the choice one can desire both continental as indian cuisine be provded i have dinner only once in Mynt which be of a nice quality strangely enough though as i be sit in the garden there be a rodent run around i hurry my dinner and tell staff who tell me to take care of it finally oth reason why the hotel be not rate as excellent be that i brough my trouser for laundry only to find out 24hr later it be it not still not in my room after call and wait 15 minute someone come to return it however i wonder if they really clean it it be perhaps dry clean as there be still a spot on the trouser which be the reason why i bring it overall though if you take these minor disturbance not too serious i would definitely recommend to stay there however if there be a wedding the music can be very very loud i arrive on a Sunday afternoon and although my room be 100meters from the venue where the wedding be hold the room be shake of the bas whether you be travel on busines or pleasure you can safely choose the Taj Westend after a long tiring day you will look forward to retire in the comfort of this beautiful low rise property surround by tranquility the room be pleasant and surround by abundant greenery all around some of them 100 year old tree the service be excellent the food be good with a choice of fine dining at either their signature Vietnamese restaurant the blue ginger or masala klub the Indian restaurant the staff be extremely courteous and professional and carry the now take for grant Taj motto customer come first you may find need for some rework with plumbing and interior but give it be a 125 year old property it be still very well maintain and the overall experience more than make up for the minor glitch my stay here be always the highlight of my trip to Bangalore this property be over 20 acre of incredibly lush tropical garden the hotel be low rise two story building spread through a very lush garden with view of tropical plant tree and planting Room be nice although become a bit date in need of update nothing wrong just some age on thing Staff be exceptional and the Masala Club be over the top good Indian tasting menu we have experience the chef at Masala Club be incredibly talented there be two blue ceramic tile pool and a very modern fitnes centre and locker area with steam and sauna this be a restive break from the urban pace of Bangalore and be a recommend place to stay the quiet luxurious and sylvan setting make it the perfect Taj property for a mini break along with my wife and teen daughter while we stay for only 24 hour the quality of the experience be quite superb our upgraded club room be simply gorgeous and so be the warmth and hospitality extend to us by the hotel staff our lunch at Masala Klub be quite memorable with the kebab platter be the standout later the mai tai and Mojitos at the Blue Bar be perfectly make our highlight though be the dinner at the Blue Ginger where the recommendation by our excellent table steward be spot on the mango papaya salad soft noodle and lemongras chicken be outstanding so be the coconut cream dessert we also use the fitnes centre and the hair salon that be top notch a couple of small area that could be fix would be a more informative and pleasant check in experience and a wobbly basin faucet in our room 1102 Small indeed consider the rest of the experience Special thank be due to Mr Somnath Mukherjee Mr Shawn and Mr Ranjith Kumar whose consideration and courtesy be heart warm we look forward to come back to this wonderful property soon Excellent customer care comfy bed in a spacious room and a choice of two place to eat drink this hotel be a sound choice if on busines and be well locate for tourist too it be currently be refurbish but the work do n t in any way interfere with my stay Nice place to be there like the restro and the variety of food they serve the service level be good and quick though expensive good to be there to enjoy the good experience overall it be good fantastic and large property in the heart of the city and yet so quiet and peaceful i ve stay at many hotel in bangalore before but this one take the cake the breakfast spread be simply amazing and the chef at the live counter make some great south indian food this property be over a 100 year old and the upkeep and maintenance be top clas never really get around use the pool and gym for lack of time but i do have a look and all the equipment be top clas staff be very courteous and friendly if you have spare time at hand in the evening walk around this large heritage property and you wo nt be bored so much to discover about this place the Taj West End be a very unique property a tastefully renovate heritage property what set it apart be the amount of greenery all around you not something that you would expect in a Business hotel in a city like Bangalore this be the first time i have stay here and be very impressed with the friendlines and courteousnes off all the staff who i interact with i be give a ground floor room in the newly renovate wing and i love the balcony that open out to what feel like a forest drink a cup of coffee in the morning look at the greenery esp after an overnight rain be one of the good way

suite at that hotel our host in Bangalore decide to arrange our rooming at the Taj West End and what a pleasant find it turn out to be the food spread at the breakfast be clearly lay out and offer a mix of Indian and non indian dish we get in quite late at night almost midnight and do not get to explore the property it be after breakfast that i decide to venture around the ground of Taj be totally impressed am a fan of old world hotel which be far remove from tower block structure the personnel be attentive and when there be a billing issue at our side they dilligently attend to it

have see the effort that the hotel staff put in for those wish to host event or for celebrate special occasion they really do go above and beyond the amount of long term customer some of whom be resident become a true testimony to the quality of service that you receive in what be clearly one of India s if not the world s good the Taj West End in Bengaluru be a serious rival to the Taj Palace in Mumbai as the hotel chain s flagship while the Mumbai Taj be awe inspire in term of the heritage build it sit within the West End have a much large footprint with multiple historic building and amazing jungle like garden and pathway you could enjoy get lose in the Taj Club room be the most expansive and detailed compare to other i have enjoy in India and well worth the price of admission alone Staff as with most Taj establishment be outstanding and very enthusiastic in their assistance the breakfast restaurant be pleasant particularly if you could secure a table on the veranda if i have one minor quibble and this do n t detract from the excellence of the West End it be that the Executive Club be unusually small but regardless the West End be a Taj diamond and one which i ca n t rate highly enough Taj Westend have retain its old world charm but with all modern amenity both in the guest room and the restaurant the hotel be centrally locate with easy acces to Malleshwaram for traditional shopping and iconic eatery and Good Malls in the neighbourhood as soon as you see the gate and plaque say 125 year and counting you feel you have hit an heritage the property sprawl over a large area the lobby be massive in itself room be renovate and give you a feel of live amidst the wild you wake up to squirrel and bird with private balcony and all equip modern facility this property

no 1401 around 10 30 pm whilst walk back to the room i pass the noisy party and loud music emanate from the open air Blue bar i sadly presume that they would turn it down by 11 pm not to be the music just go on it be unthinkable that any hotel management and not especially a TAJ hotel management would be so insensitive to its room guest at the cost of a party at their open air bar and torture them

reflect on the hotel room and amenity but they do have the new room which be so much more of a luxury aspect to it the only disappointment be the lack of activity for kid the pool be the only activity

busines meeting offer a slice of the garden city at its very heart the hotel be sprawl rich in history and very green with great restaurant option in Blue ginger and the Masala Club which in my mind top jamaivar of the Leela and ITC Windsor s North Afghan the room if you plan well be gorgeous and grand i prefer 17 14 11 and 16 serie room in that order option which Tushad who help with the booking offer and available if reasonable advance notice be provide Note these be just the standard Taj room which make this even more impressive the conference room be gorgeous with beautiful chandelier great food and lovely outdoors for a team activity the nightmarish traffic be a thing that can be avoid if team dinner be plan in UB city s vicinity around Orion mall to club shopping or ITC Windsor next door but the reason i write this review be purely for the service offer which be extremely accommodating and personalise especially for delegate with dietary preference that make my job absolutely hassle free and easy inspite of my not live in Bangalore not allow me the opportunity for advanced planning Special mention to Prasanna Vijay and the banquet chef who ensure we get everything we would possibly nee even with impromptu decision viz hold a part of the conference in the sunny outdoors when we do n t have to present lovely lunch seating which be n t originally plan for et al i d do it again here if i have the opportunity and i could n t recommend it enough decide on a night away and be able to book this property be give one of the garden room beside the pool the room be very well decorate in a classical manner the room be large and have excellent amenity there be a nice area outside with table and chair and in the shade we eat dinner at the Blue Ginger restaurant on site and the food and service be both exceptional this hotel be not cheap but we feel it be worth it stay here for the weekend for our anniversary celebration this be the 3rd time we be

help senior citizen navigate step around the property make one of the pool heat so that family can enjoy with small child though they may nee to demarcate a wing of the hotel near the pool for family with child so as to not create too much noise for some of the more privacy seek guest amazing hotel great staff clean room great food Masala bar be a must eat resto the breakfast be amazing and serve

with lush green garden all over the room have be renovate since my last visit and i enjoy it very much one recommendation would be to have more railing in the bathroom so one can hang the towel else

Great service as usual at by Taj way back then we use to order a dessert call Knicker Bocker glory a large icecream serve in a tall glas stay her bring back sweet memory Reception Excellent very accommodate to guest need Room very good Breakfast buffet good option Room service very discreet we specifically book Taj West End since we have hear that its a luxury property great service and all in reality it turn out to be hollow slogan there be a marriage party on the eve we have check in we be allot a garden view room which initially sound great the receptionist create that impression Room be not sound proof Loud party music in the marriage hall do not allow us to sleep Complaint be not attend by the Duty Manager we be tell that it be legal to have loud music after 10 PM Great Hotel and Staff stay in room 1406 Rooms be comfortable and well equipped only item be a sewer gas issue in the toilet area of the bathroom not sure if that be an India problem or a hotel problem Staff be

in Bangalore absolutely marvellous hotel Can thoroughly recommend it the bed be the most comfortable of all those we sleep in in India and the pillow be divine by comparison very high standard Lovely setting and excellent amenity this 2 week stay be on busines and the hotel could n t have do a well job whilst not as dazzling on the eye as oth busines hotel i ve stay in this hotel exceed expectation there be 2 restaurant and they be both exceptional there be a gym which be adequate the pool area be very good Laundry service be always faster than request the customer service be absolutely fantastic and all staff be a credit to the hotel Only issue be location bad traffic but you ca n t pick where your office be in fact the hotel ease this problem by be walk distance we have stay at many of the Taj hotel in our year of travel to India the West End offer a good level of service but do not perhaps live up to the standard of other have recently stay at the Taj in Chennai where the service be exemplary the West End fall behind a little in particular the wait staff who seem to un motivated and over work the food in the main dining hall be ok but not excellent we eat at the India style restaurant and the food be good but not as good as the Taj in Chennai the room be good but perhaps not as good as it look in the photo you do not really see the heritage vista of the hotel as the view guest see be look out over the garden the pool be not as large as it appear in the photo and a bit squeeze into the garden the front of house staff be very helpful i be struggle to find anything to say about this hotel it be nt bad but it be nt really good i see oth guest have a heritage walk and this would have be a pleasure to enjoy but it be not offer to us and it would have greatly improve our opinion and understanding of the hotel the Taj West End be a gorgeous place a sprawl heritage property in the heart of the city with plenty of greenery however the room be n t as nice as i have expect consider Taj be otherwise so good with heritage property i understand that the idea be to retain the vintage feel but the room just feel drab and date on the upside it be very

do a nice job operate and keep it up we also stay at the Leela faux palace and it do n t really compare neither Taj nor Leela be well place though at least Taj can walk or rickshaw to more of the center city like Chickpet market and there a very good dosa place walkable up the road within another small hotel the ground and the heritage of the Taj be what set it apart Beautiful ground wonderful facility in the centre of a city Excellent food but most of all care helpful genuine staff who ca n t do enough for you Easy to get taxi or auto in the street if you do n t have your own car Convenient location for sightseeing or shopping Try to take the Heritage Tour at 5 pm offer through the concierge desk as this give an interesting overview of the history of this fine hotel this hotel

Bangalore and we keep come back with family at least once a year though we reside locally in Bangalore for the she extravagance of the heritage and the way its build sprawl to the 20 acre as it give a great feel and satisfaction as if have travel some where to far away place and away from all the urban living hazard without doubt the Taj West End be a green oasi in the heart of traffic city bangalore it boast a 125 history and unfortunately still seem stuck in India s past while hotel like the Shangri la manage to keep up to date with bangalore s statu as an IT capital the Taj s service seem stick in a lackadaisical and lacklustre old india manner quite different to the charming efficiency of its Mumbai namesake our reception on arrival be pleasant enough despite a distracted receptionist our room be well proportion and tastefully decorate and look out onto the lush green garden the bathroom however while apparently clean have a plague of little fly that suggest otherwise a minor irritation the garden of the hotel be the real highlight of the stay Beautiful tree and shrub the path around the garden be a little confusing and to get to the health facility from our room we end up veer off the official route and that old India of pile up rubbish and lack of care be what we experience just behind the veneer of grandeur at the bar in the evening we decide to sample the Taj s own brand wine it take an inordinately long time to be serve a stale red serve refrigerated one just have the feeling of a disarray in the service Room service be not much well a vegetarian biriyani be order a meat biriyani be bring after wait again for inordinately long Breakfast in the morning be just okay again one feel the service in disarray in contrast with the attentivenes of the Taj in Mumbai and oth Bangalore hotel dish be leave to pile up on the table and we be not check on once the pool be pleasant to relax beside and the sauna area be nice enough again it be the greenery that be this hotel s real highlight the Taj West End be a beautiful heritage property that be set in beautiful garden as long as you do n t look behind the scene but in the end i feel disappointed by the seeming lack of care by an inattentive staff Checkout be no different on settle the bill the receptionist refuse to offer change a typical old India problem yes there have be problem since demonetarisation but if oth hotel Shangri la have no problem both change money and offering change you would expect the Taj to be able to too it seem to be just too much of a hassle i would love to be able to submit a more positive review be a fan of the Taj brand and Inner Circle member but in this instance my hope and expectation be definitely not meet Second visit to Taj and while the property be glorious really sad to see that it be not well Organised and the service be poor from efficiency point of view Example at breakfast there be no coffee or tea machine and therefore during new year when lot of people be present they do n t upstaff nor do they manage to get the beverage in time one have to ask and wait for 45 minute to realise that your order be forget only to ask again Same with many oth thing the staff would say with a smile for anything sure we will get it to your table and it would n t arrive at all or arrive 1 hr later Executive inn be so much more efficient the hotel be confuse not enough staff to maintain the old way and not efficient like the contemporary hotel Same thing be evident in room and at reception order forget not get back in time and not efficient Food be not at all up to scratch quite unauthentic Sweet sambar and uninspiring dosa the property be charming and the weather glorious i have give the west end average only because all try to smile and be

soon the staff of this hotel be very nice and helpful however the room be really wear down and even after we get the linen change it still have spot and stain on them for the price of this hotel this be definitely not value for money its such a beautiful property its huge spread out with so much potential but unfortunately not take care of at all Huge gap in the whole ambiance room suite be so big with large sized bathroom but cleanlines of sheet towel be not up to the mark extremely lay back staff the suite 204 we occupy have a leaky basin we ask the housekeeping staff to look into it but nothing be do each time we use the flush it be like a mini tsunami the floor toilet paper roll keep there would get wet we complain but gues the staff be just use to people complain they turn a blind eye to it all the restaurant be a huge let down Breakfast buffet look pathetic because no one seem to be interested in cleanlines Food be all over the place no one bother to clean up tablecloth look as though they have n t be clean for day cup saucer plate all need to be check properly before use as most of them have mark surprisingly ala carte dinner be well the buffet look pathetic Management really need to look into the running of this property its very sad to see such a run down state of someplace which could be a winner hand down glad we choose Ramanashree California as a venue it be an dream event everything be just perfect supportive staff they make sure minute detail be take care Special thank to Surojit and Pullappa i go to this resort as part of my office team outing we stay there for a day we get a good deal price wise however the expectation i have from this 3 star rate resort be disappointing now this resort seem to be more around 15 to 20 year old and it clearly visible in the structure it only the reception and lobby that good the rest of the area be below average when you consider the 3 star rating Planning be poor and the only restaurant Dabba get an 80 s theme it like you re travel back in time the lunch buffet be bad and majority of the dish be tasteless Service be pathetic and we nee run after them to get anything Evening snack and tea be horrible and we have to complain it to the manager Manager apologize and say that he will personally check the dinner now the dinner turn out good so the staff know how to cook better but they be just lazy before and least bother room be good for the price you pay it be clean however bed linen be old and there be no water bottle in the room you have to call room service to get water in fact they give complimentary bottle but you nee to call them for it now come to amenity they get badminton tenni basketball and squash court it be just fine nothing great the pool look good but it turn out to be nightmare 3 of my friend get cut their toe in the pool staff be nowhere to be see and we have to call them to get first aid box it the tile that the culprit they be old and need to be replace better not to get into the pool if you care for your safety it be again the same casual reaction from the staff it like you re go to a government guest house and nobody care i suggest to stay away from this place i have celebrate my 1st aniversary in Ramanashree California Resort Everything in the resort be superb the staff be very cooperative they will take care of their guest in a good manner Food be very tasy and resonable they make our day very special Everything be upto the mark highly recommend to evryone this be my second visit to Ramanashree California hotel and this time i have book two room there be no oth good hotel at this price point in this location Food be generally good but you do nt get la carte in the morning only buffet in the morning about 7 of us be go to a marriage in the morning and we do not want to have breakfast at the hotel as there be a sufficiently lavish Breakfast spread where we be go i want to order idly for my mother in law only who be diabetic and need to have an early breakfast but i have to pay for the buffett as i could not order idly only Food quality though be sup and it be better compare to my previous visit Ramanashree also have oth activity like the pool sauna gym kid area etc which you may want to use its a good value if you use them we have a suite and another room that be book the oth room be also upgrade to a suite and i appreciate the gesture the room be very clean it be airy but in Bangalore you can not keep the window open at night without mosquito come in the general area where the hotel be locate be very clean though Hotel itself be very neatly maintain Service in Ramanashree be very good Staff be always courteous and do their work with a smile i would especially commend all the day time reception staff and bell boy the security staff be also very helpful and do their job with a smile i somehow do n t find the bed in Ramashree suitable for a nice sleep second time in a row they be a bit hard and clumpy and the comforter be also a bit rough i do not get good sleep this time as well or it could be myself i have a very tiring day both time bathroom be nice they be very clean compare to my previous stay we get hot water everywhere in the sink in the shower and even in the toilet spray kudo one thing i would tell the hotel management Improve the bed and comforter please Everything else be sup and please maintain it as it be we go there for our team outing it be a group of around 40 50 people the place be easy to reach although away from the city it be on a highway so you ca n t go out of the resort for a walk or anything they have pool volleyball court badminton court and the regular indoor game but there be no cricket for football field also the property be old decently well maintain the food be average room be spacious we stay in this resort for two day the location of the resort be nice without traffic hassle Checkin and check out be smooth and fast Room decoration be mind blow they

be attach pic below in the spread of item hardly there be any non veg item except half cook oily hot dog with a Chinese taste also no one expect non sugary tea or coffee because it already mix with

be good expect the breakfast few item be not fresh Manager in restaurant replace and give straight from kitchen Rest all be good bye we book this resort only because it be close to the airport we be 3 girl stay at this property for 2 day and 2 night thing go horribly wrong as below 1 we book a 3 occupancy room on booking com it be claim that it would be double bed a futon bed but they just put a mattres on the floor with a duvet cover as blanket they take an hour just to put a mattres on the floor and the housekeeping guy have the audacity to tell he be train to do his job they all know very well to back answer though 2 House keeping service be so bad that despite of multiple reminder they do not clean our room for 2 day 3 Room service be so delay for anything we call they use to easily take good 45 min to 1 hr 4 our package be with buffet breakfast but the buffet management be so bad such that some 100 people show up there be no refilling for food and we all feel like beggar ask for food there Hotel staff be least bother about all the chao 5 one night at 2 be we hear someone knock our door we immediately call the reception they say it be a room service person to give us the water but we have not ask for water at all we complain while check out and they call us later to say that it be the next door guy who get the wrong door but i still wonder why the reception person claim that to be a room service person the previous night he even say he would make us talk to the service guy that incident be little creepy i do n t think the management be bother about the safety of the guest at all 6 Property be not great since it be locate in the outskirt you can expect a cheap crowd driver house keep people who would just stare at you we pay Rs 7175 for this horrible experience i be never go back there nor do i recommend this resort to anyone it be a comfortable stay with short period as i be there for only one night could not use oth facility s but hope for next time but must say tasty food and value for money its well than last stay away from the chao that Bangalore city have and also close to Bangalore airport Food be a treat to the taste bud but the room service be delay also the room need some renovation Spa be be miss we spend a lazy evening near the pool enjoy the nice climate Will surely plan up a revisit it be a second time trip for me as i be there for a

hear for conference well train front office staff and good service nice swimming poll with all sport facility we all be enjoy cricket check in and check out be very smooth room be equip with all necessary amenity Front desk manager and all the resort staff be good with and helpful overall be good stay this be one of the old resort on Doddaballapur Road and hence not necessarily the clean one but it have a great ambience green surrounding and a good food option Stay may not be a great one for all but ideal for spend the weekend in a relaxed manner or for hold small group meeting busines or family i stay in this hotel with my kid as i have to attend a marriage near Doddaballapur for 2 day i pay r 4k for 2 adult and 2 kid its high as i book through Cleartrip but i have no option as i have a Cleartrip voucher and do not book sufficiently in advance my wife decide to stay with her relative at the last moment as well Pros 1 Location its locate on a nice major road lead to Doddaballapur from Yelahanka and you will not find any oth hotel at this price nearby with the same quality i would have stay at Angsana which be nearby but its a bit expensive at r 7k per night 2 amenity its not just a hotel but a resort too you can enjoy free swimming pool Sauna Gym and oth activity 3 very friendly staff and service Neutral Buffet Breakfast OK food Cons 1 Bedding bed be not very comfortable and also we do not get a King size bed also my young son fall off the bed twice as it slope at the edge which be strange Comforter Duvet give be not cosy at all and a bit rough we do not have a restful sleep 2 Bathroom Bathroom be cramped there be a bath tub but its spotty and not very clean Toilet seat could be a bit more clean shiny as well also you do n t get warm water in the evening if you nee to take a shower but we get nice hot water during the day include in the sink Conclusion if you be stay for a few day and want to use the Amenities this would be a good choice it would also be a good choice if you have busines in the surround area Good for a couple maybe Everything about the hotel except for the Breakfast be poor Food be terrible lot of big mosquito in the room the Curd Rice normally decently available in South India be extremely terrible in nature California Ramanashree be a misnomer the hotel have quite frankly become a complete dump Whats bad be i have stay here before its not fancy but in a pinch it work this past trip however be a memory i wish i could erase not just for the room but the attitude of the management lets review i book a room March 24 27 of March and pay for it online over 21k in total it be for a family emergency and my flight to Bangalore land late the night of the 24th when i get to the resort after 1 am the receptionist who greet me look like he have just roll out of bed his hair be tousle his tie and shirt throw on and untucke frankly the security guard be better dressed than he be i get to my room 211 and when i go to lock the door i find the lock would not work jiggle the key in the door think the lock may be stick but no luck call the front desk and the man who come up to the room first try to convince me all i need be the security chain and no function lock when i protest he move me to room 206 with a door that look like the lock have be chew to bit see picture that wasnt the bad of it there be a swan sculpture on the bed which while kitschy be cute move it however reveal the issue Dirty sheet and it wasnt just one side of the bed it be both i be exhaust at this point but still call the front desk and ask for fresh sheet i be tell there be no one i just say send me the sheet and i will change them the porter finally bring new sheet and in a real bad temper rip off the blanket and chuck it on the floor when he remove the sheet we both see the stain mattres pad and i ask for a fresh one he reluctantly go to see if he could find it only to come back a half an hour later and say there be none they be ask to never change the pad i ask if he would sleep on that stain bed and he shake his head of course as a guest we be expect to i try to call the Duty Manager and he be miss in Action MIA i be a guest complain about a dirty room heaven help the guest who may have a heart attack in the early hour of the morning i finally give up in disgust and spend a few hour scrunch on a tiny couch Next morning the Duty Manager come up to the room and agree it be a mes as to where he be a few hour earlier your gues be as good as mine he say no one try to reach him the front desk say his phone just keep ring when they try i speak with the Front Office Manager the Housekeeping Manager and the Duty Manager name all below send the Front Office Manager a letter request a full refund and at his request sign a copy of the bill for the first night procedure i be tell and in my tired state i just do it fast forward to March 29th when i call the Front Office Manager he confirm i will be issue a full refund which have be clear by the Head Office Today April 2nd i get a call from the Accounts Manager say i will be refund only for two night because i technically stay one night on a couch in a room with a dirty bed with no help from the hotel whatsoever Hospitality and accountability redefine at this resort the manager i speak with on the day include the MIA Duty Manager the Front Office Manager Rohit Kumar Asst Banquets Manager Basava Kumar S not sure why he be there and not housekeeping and today Accounts Manager Praveen the picture attach will show you the quality of the room provide to me the bed remain unmade the entire night to everyone who be there the night of the 24th your mattres pad could have be just as clean as mine Veerendra Shadakshari as Managing Director you should be ashamed to have this property in your portfolio without a complete quality review who sign off on these room before the next customer check in id like a complete refund please without one night be swallow up for a very grubby room in pass i end up staying in Bangalore for a total of 5 night if your room have be clean and service professional i would have stay and you would have have the additional busines never again you describe your hotel as an oasis on your website ill pas thank stay for a day nice location on main road though no dust and noise Road communication easily available surround tastefully do with a small swimming pool garden be well maintain so sit out be pleasant i be give a room behind the reception Room and toilet be not maintain clean properly Basic toiletry not provide Food be good complement to the chef not really sure if the resort be design to service busines or leisure traveler do n t exactly meet need expectation of either Basic facility be take care of room be much small than they appear in the photograph still could be a good choice if a short stay be a must in this part of the city stay with family for day use prior catch the overnight flight get a free upgrade to Suite room friendly attentive and courteous staff during the day evening staff ruin this with pretty little issue due to lack of front desk communication no hot water entire my stay just little warm water which be run out in the afternoon have to ask the front desk multiple time in the evening his answer be boiler be off it will take 45 min to heat end up with warm water after 2 hr ask for extra cup and some tea bag in the evening after repeat call they show up after one hour with a bucket and tea bag Resort be old it seriously need the renovation you will notice mould every corner in the washroom break tile and not work power port i wish they prepare the room as per the number of people occupy so the guest do nt nee to request for extra towel and oth amenity tip no power port near the bed the only available one in the room be under the tv so carry multiple socket one with a long wire Hotel be not at all worth for the full price book only when there be a big discount so you wo nt be disappointed if you do nt get hot water tell them immediately they will not switch on the broiler unless you complain my visit to the resort for a day stay on 20th December turn out to be a very harrowing and disappointing experience Contrary to what be show on their website the quality of service be extremely poor the attitude of the staff be as if they really do n t care if you stay or not stay on their premise this time of the year bengaluru be cold and there be no hot water run when it be bring to the attention of the staff they just do not bother eventually we have to somehow manage to take a bath in cold water Next day again the same story no hot water for take a bath their staff be least bother and this be a very sorry situation no one from the management even bother to meet up with us to resolve the issue just when we be check out their manager come to meet that too after my repeat request it appear that they be not interested in do hospitality busines as they just do n t care about customer i advise all Trip advisor member not to visit any of their property on their trip to bengaluru please stay away from Ramanshree California property i stay at this hotel about 6 year ago unfortunately i do n t think some of the room have have the maintenance they require for me to provide a well review my room itself be fine with adequate space the bathroom while have plenty of hot water and great water pressure be in need of some maintenance such as replace the grouting break tile and bath sealant the shower head could also do with renew the bath shower tap be a bit stiff too i do have to request toilet paper on more than one occasion on the plus side the staff be friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet be more than adequate with a mix of Indian and continental choice Food for dinner be also tasty and portion be good the lobby area be bright clean and welcoming and although i do not use the swimming pool this do look very clean too as the corridor be not carpet it can be a bit noisy when people be walk and talk in them at night i have to connect to wifi through use of a code send through to my mobile which have to be renew each day this be not a huge issue for me personally i believe this resort be more than 15 year old naturally the AC s have outlive the utility and need replacement we stay here for 6 day with MAP plan luckily we be upgrade to suite room after 3 day which have a good AC we be book at r 4500 per day on direct booking and late additional discount of r 500 be offer the resort have a gym swimming pool and a basketball court Sauna facility be not available despite our repeat request one excuse or the oth be give Hot water too be an issue during evening time 24 hour hot water be not available but they arrange for in case of necessity or demand generally buffet breakfast be serve but in case occupancy be less Ala Carte breakfast be serve which be good because of freshly prepare stuff on Sundays special brunch be serve we be unlucky not to taste it because we be invite by family friend for lunch Ala Carte Dinner too be good consider they serve what you require our food consumption be limit and therefore we enjoy the same basically the resort be fill due to seminar and group booking which be at bargain price the location on Doddaballapur main road be ideal for people look to travel to airport one nee not get catch in traffic jam at Hebbal hopefully they will upgrade all their defective and outdated AC we would recommend the same on MAP plan its an old 1980 style place Mix of hotel and resort room be big enough but not maintain and renovate Unnecessary furniture keep in room surprise me as well as miss towel for which i call the staff 3 time Stay if no well option avbl its a very well maintain hotel consider that it be over 25 year old the staff make the difference their courtesy and pro activenes set this hotel above the rest in its league a special mention of the GM Mr Thakor he be a veteran in hospitality and be one of the most affable person i have ever meet Do n t mis their sunday buffet lunch especially the biriyani my kid call it awesooooome i love this hotel Breakfast buffet be nice Lunch and dinner be on order basi food be good Front desk staff housekeeping staff restaurant staff be really polite and very humble Room be clean and quite spacious Basic amenity be provide in the washroom overall it be a good experience stay at this place earlier in Feb 2014 this apparently be a poor man s resort who have little money and be in need to experience resort like feeling People like us on busines trip be exploit to the core be it accomodation food transportation you name it Facility and Services be average or may be a notch below staff be unqualified and unprofessional Come evening and mosquito from drain and lake in the vicinity come look for frustrated prey and have a field time beware Only thing be the GM Mr Rathore but he too be bind by stingy rule from the management be compel to stay again this Feb for professional reason but well sense prevail within a day s stay and move out to a well alternative God bles our soul we go for a DAY OUTING package to this so call Resort basically it be a Hotel with a swimming pool and some regular game room we reach there and nobody attend to us for almost 15 min then we spend time in the Swimming Pool for 2 hour the pool be sparkle clean we head on to lunch he say there be no buffet for the day we go the person just keep whatever food he have on our table we have no option though the food be very good we would have preffere a buffet so we can choose what we want there be nothing much here to do for a day outing play some basketball and table tenni and go to their small garden nothing special i recommend never GO for DAY OUTING in this RESORT experience on 26 June 2017 it a nice property huge one with a lot of facility the food be not so great but rest the place be nice you will have a lot of thing to do as almost all the facility be nice and fun be there on multiple occasion for busines purpose it recommend to give it one nice shot okay furnished room with good AC and neat bathroom that sufficient when you ve a large Indian family to cater for a day D their buffet lunch and dinner have almost same menu but the dessert be a delight Breakfast have a good combination of continental and south Indian and be good again so value for money definitely Location be great for those hop in out of the airport Perfect place for day out pool be good and food be awesome the GM Mr Thakore be very helpfull and personally enquire about the problem face and take the feedback overall a great place to visit there be also a tenni court and outdoor game like cricket can be play although there be no seperate ground for cricket we gone 3 day i really enjoy and i have wounder full meomerie and special the food be awssome and we swimme in awssome and high quality swimming pool and rally these 3 day i will remember and i advise eyryone should go to this place as we have to catch an early morning flight we decide to stay in this hotel it be a small hotel with small room our room have basic amenity our room be small and cramped its okay for a single person or a couple but for a family its too small and cramped its good for people look for budget friendly hotel in that area our stay be inclusive of breakfast and the buffet breakfast be good have stay for two night whilst on official visit with two oth colleague have a harrowing experience be shock to see the appalling condition of the room one of my colleague have to shift room thrice at night due to unserviceability of TV Ac power failure Response from house keeping be unprofessional as report very basic facility in the room not commensurate to the charge and the claim on net of a three four star hotel resort the F B segment be very elementary and the spread be very very basic Bell desk not man have to carry luggage to room the toilet space be cramp up with neither the tap work smoothly nor clear flow of water from the bathing place hence the basic not provide grossly under staffed as at night time the desk be un man when question about the hotel certification the desk show a certificate as Ramanashree Shopping Arcade Ltd in summation it s a glorify lodge so do nt get mislead by the advertisement on the net if you desire value for money Attempeted to discus wiht the manager but to no avail over all a miserable time wish my visit organiser could have visit prior to booking i have organise a get to gether of about 100 guest in the lawn on 22nd April 2017 the arrangement make by the Resort be fantastic the food be amazing the service be par excellence we have also take two room

for kid swim pool and small park be there and veg and non veg food be available Cab be available room be good with TV and freeze Nice conference hall be available room show and amenity show here be entirely different from actual room be not good complete waste of money no Scott they do they only hand over the key at reception and show you the way rest you nee to help yourself out yes food be

bird relax Refresh your self a short break gateway in banglore Resort be beautiful however the the management be poor Pool be so dirty full of dead fly bug and ant every where on Sunday Morning i ask the staff if the pool be clean and she say yes Staff do not mention about any complimentary stuff you would end up pay for water bottle if you accidentally dial Room Service instead of House Keeping no one tell about complimentary High tea have to figure it out while take a walk Bar Tender be very slow to respond Lot of fly fly around buffet spread no staff the take care no board keep between Veg and Non Veg during High tea go with family and take two room stay for 2 night and 3 day over a weekend there be a special package that we get by talk to the staff directly which be not list on their website the property be fantastic and be away from all the noise and bustle of the city list the positive and negative below positive Great property Good facility Good food negative Poor maintenance disengage staff Reservation proces be complicated Details Reservation no one answer the phone we try for a couple of day finally leave a note on the website with our phone number and they call back we get a good deal that be n t available elsewhere on their website or on any oth travel aggregator s website it be pretty painful try to reach someone to talk to the website say they be fully book but accord to the staff they be n t our own experience indicate that they be n t fully book so if you experience difficulty with booking leave a message and hope that they call you back Check in proces be smooth and there be no difficulty experience the staff take care of transport our luggage to our room when we be have lunch the property be fantastic lot of tree plant and bird all around the place Several plumeria tree bre in a relaxing aroma in the evening and there be gras lawn all around the place no problem with insect or mosquito whatsoever which be a terrific experience room be OK and well equipped clean towel sheet Plenty of storage space a safe TV with cable work table plenty of light and electric outlet there be a few power cut but the generator kick in very quickly bathroom be super clean and basic thing like soap shampoo moisturizer shaving kit toothbrush and toothpaste be all provide there be a few laundry bag but no slipper to wear inside our room one power socket be almost come off the wall there be also a fine layer of dust on some of the cabinet and when we walk in it do n t look like it be clean properly TV in our room do n t work well and there be band problem top 1 3rd of the screen be mess up completely do not use the WiFi on property and no one mention that WiFi exist i find out that they offer free WiFi when i be settle the bill and a guest who be check in ask about it there be a decent variety of food for all meal overall the food be decent however on one evening it seem that the staff forget about people stay at the resort and forget to serve coffee tea in the evening we have to request and there be some confusion on whether it be part of our package it be or not it take around 30 45 minute for them to sort it out and finally serve us Many table be n t clean when we arrive at the restaurant plate be remove table be dirty glass for water be n t place at the table and we have to scout and pickup unused glass for drink water ourselves among the facility provide the pool be the best maintain however there be no umbrella to provide any protection against the hot sun during the daytime if you want to just relax by the pool the indoor sport room need some serious look into and require cleaning maintenance and replacement of equipment Provision for regular water be poor with almost no water dispenser we have always want to avoid single use plastic bottle and have carry our own bottle but have to really try hard to find dispenser to fill the bottle up Staff keep say Room service will provide bottled water and could not understand our situation while we do n t see many people in the resort the spa be fully book throughout the duration of our stay so if you be look at use the service of the Spa you nee to make reservation well in advance they treat walk in and guest of the resort with the same priority and there be no special reservation available for guest of the resort Checkout proces be simple but with one glitch settle the bill and request for a bell boy after around 15 minute of settle the bill we decide to walk our luggage to the parking since no one show up one staff notice that we be check out and offer to carry our luggage Overall i would not recommend Angsana Resort highly neither would i consider stay there again while they have their positive many oth resort offer a well experience for the same amount of money when i pay a premium price i expect premium service Willing to overlook the maintenance of indoor sport room but the rest of the experience be far from premium i have recommend spending time at Angsana with awarenes of their international reputation but be let down with their quality of service to me they re just an above average resort with good property bad EXPERIENCE ever we attend a wedding in April 2019 we stay for 3day from 20th 22nd April we have many complaint regard the hospitality concern to the resort they complain be as follow 1 a terribly unhygienic hotel dirty linen smelly bedroom bathroom be broken and dirty curtain be bad 2 Staff untrained and clueless about the response to their guest 3 no bell boy facility we be the one who be lift the luggages which be disgusting 4 Food be terrible no taste at all the food service be really bad as there be no waiter to serve us the food be not serve to the guest at a prop time as the closing time be 10 30 they close at 10 00 and start the food service at 9 00 for the breakfast 5 Dinner and lunch be serve very late there be nobody to pick the plate from the table as there be no prop facility of the waiter 6 Mr Subrahmania manager do not reapond to our query 7 the room be not allot to us on time 8 House keeping do not respond to our request for pillow towel bedsheet cleaning room cleaning Didnt respond to our call 9 the charge of the room be very high and overrated 10 i stay in the suit room the room be very bad and untidy and the curtain be badly tear and the bath tub wasnt working overall my EXPERIENCE in this RESORT be bad and i WOULD never RECOMMEND this RESORT to ANYONE Thank you for the bad service Booking be take by their GM himself as i know him and and it make very simple and easy Perfect coordination i would like to review this place with rating so ot give clear picture of the facility Food 5 10 Room Service 6 10 General Amenities 6 10 in Room amenity 4 10 Value for Money 5 10 for some citi cable issue the channel be not work and kid be extremely bored out end of the day Unbearable toooo many mosquito Suggest them to introduce a day out plan and maintain the pool for a well experience we be due to be in Bangalore on a stop over from 5 am to 8 pm and book this hotel so that we could get some sleep Were a family of 5 and have stay in oth Angsana and Banyan Tree hotel previously so i think the 2 bed suite would be ideal for us it wasnt cheap almost 400 for the 1 day so i be expect it to be at least comparable to oth lead hotel weve stay in even after adjust for general Indian standard we werent expect the same level as London or Dubai but certainly up to the standard weve experience in the like of Thailand Overall we be extremely disappointed the staff be great and very keen to help but in all oth regard this hotel be pretty awful the room be large but basic there be a kitchenette with a large DIY rat trap in one cupboard the bedroom be ok but the bed hard and the bedding old even after fly all night we be only able to get a few hour sleep here the ground be ok but nothing special the uneven paving of the path and walkway be a nightmare for buggy and small foot and there be quite a lot of step up and down from room to restaurant or reception the pool be grubby and full of dead insect leave etc to the point that even the kid be reluctant to get in the pool there be a waterfall that come on briefly while we be there for little more than a demonstration before stop again the day bed which be in the hotel picture of the pool be filthy now even sit on towel i be concern by just how dirty it be the lounger no longer have cushion so arent very comfortable Room service food be dreadful we be hungry but barely manage 1 3 of it the pizza be tasteless but edible but the chicken sandwich be full of bone and gristle and be completely inedible the diet coke be fine but the latte we order be undrinkable taste like the milk be off the ride from the airport be about 25 min at 6 am through some interesting but very poor area Overall i would struggle to identify any positive reason to stay here and the fact that two room at the far superior Taj Bangalore at the airport cost less than a two bed suite here just add insult to injury we be due to stay there again on our return journey but the anticipation of it be so bad that weve forfeit our non refundable room charge another almost 400 and book room at the Taj instead have a great experience at Angsana Bangalore the staff be very friendly and helpful Food could be a little well but all in all a wonderful experience Special thank to Mr Om Prakash and Mr Mahipal for their continuous help and patience in deal with a big team visit the place to celebrate my wife s birthday and spend a day far from the daily hustle of life the place exactly give that Nice food lovely room and the ambience be of the reality be brilliant it be a great time spend with Family room be neat and clean the Service be also excellent there be enough space for parking but if it get little busy then it may be difficult to get you a parking space the approach road be bit bad now improve visit on busines but i would clearly rate the place perfect for a personal getaway as well base on the experience Good ambience good food good service good from the manager to the service guy Didnt get a chance to find anything wrong overall the property be excellent its great getaway i be there for Corporate meeting and i think that the House Keeping be not at all at its good it take at least 2 3 reminder to get their attention and get the basic necessity item the aroma tea light in the room be not there be available after three reminder only for the personnel to realize that the equipment be absent in the room the shampoo and conditioner be not available again 2 3 reminder the personnel come with a refill only to realize there be no bottle toiletry be unavailable Slippers be not available AC be not function towel be not crisp and clean thus i would give only 2 for House Keeping and thus 3 for an overall experience we be very much happy with our stay at resort food service be great Resort be green very well maintain great setup of facility good location for relaxation we have a candle light dinner at pool side it be so romantic atmosphere location be perfect for couple we book a one bed room suite which be suitable for us all the request which be place by us while reserve the room be take care by Special thank to Mr Ankur for make our Day special the resort be about an hour from Bangalore city and maybe 30 45 min from the airport Approach road be decent the property be green and have a lot of activity but the room while spacious be in desperate need of renovation and housekeeping and service be poor my bed have make in a hurry when i check in fan AC do n t work properly no hand towel barely any amenity in the bathroom Good for an outing but definitely not a five star property though the rate may be clearly this resort have see its good day either in term of Maintenance Food and Banquets or Service one would expect a Property of this nature consider its in Bangalore bless with good weather and fairly decent rainfall to be maintain well but clearly this doesnt seem to be the priority of resort management Inadequate proces absence of quality practice and supervisor and perhaps absence of training all have leave this property very rusty off course this resort exploit its proximity of location and the huge demand of IT Industries in and around Bangalore for an outside location venue their meeting training need and couldnt care less to maintain as busines come automatically and most time overbooke we could clearly see that this resort invest very less than what it earn and the decay be to be see come to Food very poorly maintain and run hygiene be give a go by not to mention of either the quality or taste of food one the first day the Idlis be so bad that it resemble an rubber ball most preparation be terrible either prepare by people who have so little knowledge of what they prepare or couldnt care less the overbooking of the resort ensure that during peak time the user have to fend for themselves and the supervisor or manager do a disappear act leave the hapless staff to take the wrath of user if youre arrange a cocktail or party please fall back on trust and mostly dry item as most non veg preparation be very poor sight to even see forget taste the staff be very poorly train in service etiquette have no mean of properly guide any request have to be tell again and again it look like no one be in charge and thing happen just by itself in a totally messy way the room maintainance be very poor please take your own towel to avoid use poorly wash dry towel of the resort there be many more thing to go on and on overall we have a very forgettable stay and its very unlikely that we would ever go there consider the resort management poor commitment to its customer and very little value for money Ambience of the resort be good the resort be very spacious the room be not maintain well as it a old resort Flush be not work properly in bath room it be break Wash basin in bath room be clog the food be not tasty and good compare to lunch and dinner breakfast be ok Swimming pool be maintain well Landscape be good over all experience be ok we have visit Angsana for a busines meeting the resort have fabulous pool great food decent room and service overall well maintain locate 25 30 min from airport plus point have a wonderful stay Varun be so hard work person seem like he be work for the guest he provide us great hospitality and willing to visit the resort back soon with family Keep up good word and varun be asset to angsana resort go there for a full day meeting with the office team the resort be beautifully do up with quite a few facility like the swimming pool meeting space lawn tenni indoor game pool table etc but the villa steal the show they re huge clean and aloof such a beautiful and relaxing place away from the city Wonderful staff

experience we enjoy every moment of the stay at the resort Homely environment great place to enjoy away from city life Vicinity to airport and city make it more comfortable we stay here for 2 night for a wedding we be look after well and a special thank to Mr C Subramanya the GSM he make it extra special he give us a good rate and ensure we have no trouble whatsoever extremely polite helpful and prompt which be what make the difference my husband even undertake a spa experience which be heavenly the breakfast be great Thank you so much for the brilliant hospitality love the setting too book almost 60 room for a family wedding last week over 3 day Spacious airy and well appoint room very courteous and accommodation staff very attentive chef who cook the food to our requirement and lush green natural ambience far from the city Particular mention of Mr Varun Bharadwaj a trainee who go out of his way to get us quality service on demand on the negative side facility be not wheel chair friendly path be stone line so not easy to walk on and we have people with twisted ankle path be mood light during the night however overall really memorable experience for the whole family across age group firstly we have book a executive room from make my trip which show picture of a spacious room with 2 queen size bed but when we check in the room be small and have only twin bed we ask for extra bed as we be 4 of us they tell us that the cost of the extra bed be the same as the cost of the room after much haggling they move us to a 1 bedroom suite unfortunately we have an incident at the resort my mother who be 68 year old have a fall while we be take a stroll at the resort she need immediate medical help the hotel send a doctor after 1 2 hour they have no first aid facility available at the resort the doc suggest we should go to the hospital as it could be a fracture we ask the management to arrange a transport as it be late in the evening and it be an emergency the resort have no transport and they say it will cost us r 1000 to get us to the near hospital we have to arrange our own transport finally the management have no basic courtesy to help us with get a wheelchair till the gate or even to check if we need anything overall very unfriendly and unprofessional staff Exotic Venue for relax Must go for Couples on special occasion and celebration lot of Flora to enjoy this place Wake up and be surround by the vivid hue of nature Be enchant by the culture and history of Bangalore the gateway of Southern India Angsana Oasis Spa Resort straddle between the major city but yet preserve the history of the destination give traveller a taste and touch of modernity and the beginning of Bangalore after much search on trip advisor i finally book this resort for an overnight stay with my teenage kid honestly initially when i book i do feel it be a little expensive as compare to some oth resort in Bangalore but after check in i feel it be value for money and in fact much more reasonable as compare to certain oth so call luxury resort that charge similar but do n t provide comparable service the pro of this resort be 1 the moment you enter the vast green and exceedingly well maintain and clean landscape of the property soothe your tired sense 2 swimming pool be huge clean and actually very beautifully design 3 well equip gym 4 excellent outdoor game facility football cricket court lawn tenni court 5 food be awesome the complimentary breakfast have a wide variety of spread their aloo puri and pan cake be a must try we hog so much that we have to skip lunch 6 their accomodation be what take the cake away from oth resort i have book for 3 adult so be under the impression that we will be provide an extra bed in a standard room when we enter our one bedroom suite we be speechless see its size and luxurious set up we have one large bedroom plus a humungous living room with family size dining table study TV sofa cum bed on which my teenage boy sleep like a baby the accomodation provide have 2 bathroom so no scramble for 3 people there be a beautiful lawn at the back and a small lawn in front too see the accomodation i understand why their price be in the bracket of exclusive resort and not the budget one 7 last but not the least and in fact the most important what make a resort successful be its staff and service and Angsana have excellent service the staff definitely have attention for detail their guest relation coordinator Noorjahan make our entire stay memorable and comfortable on arrival it be she who establish the first good impression about the resort for us she give us personalized attention to the extent of smilingly take us on a tour of the entire property she be always there just a phone call away to take care of all our need what touch me the most be that during the check in we be not just pack away into our room with room boy it be Noorjahan who personally accompany us to our room she surprise me by offer to help us carry our hand luggage which i offcourse refuse the next day i see Noorjahan accompany oth guest too Overall the resort be a must must stay in for a relaxed weekend with friend or family it even get a spa health club and indoor game that we could n t try due to shortage of time one night be too short to enjoy the place so if possible book for 2 night Cons well i really ca n t think of any con an excellent resort on the outskirt of Bangalore the landscaping be excellent and the room though a bit old be well keep there be varied kind of accommodation available from double room to suite with even Jacuzzi and private pool the common pool be poorly locate at the entrance with no privacy Suitable for Corporate function with a large conference hall almost in the basement with no disturbance the dining hall be a bit crammed consider the large number of room have a good chill out day Great hospitality from the staff particularly Varun who insist on drop us with our bag to the car park we do not have much luggage overall a very relaxing day the balcony be a nice place to spend the evening the resort be too old and not maintain properly when it come to outside facility the dinning area be poor both in term of food and service Shortage of staff and menu choice the swimming area have a family of 3 monkey who play more in swim pool than the child look to the service of dinning do not try to take a chance with the health centre not worth the value for mo any seem that it be not earn the required revenue thus maintenance be very poor we be about 11 member from different geography stay for 3 day Suites be like 1 BHK very spacious and comfortable well maintain clean and tidy Front office team member and customer relation officer be very humble and very co operative Check in Check out formality be very fast the Pre requisite for the busines meeting well organized during meet the staff serve the cookie and hot beverage and they do their part very well

could often get confused lose Would not call it a great place for family as kid would get a bit bored with no much of activity area overall a pleasant experience and nothing much to crib about nice property large and airy but i find the layout and pathway too confusing the room be date and in need of repair redeeming factor be the food tasty and a large spread to choose from good for offsite but i do nt see this as a family destination Overall very good experience very friendly and helpful staff specially varun and other i have leave my laptop charger they be so nice to courier it to me

property have turn more into a place for corporate offsite outing Corporate event experience be fair where people do not expect the pampering that come with an upmarket resort and spa package they nee to be a little more particular about overall quality for example the the towel provide in room smell of oil its common sense to keep and wash spa towel separately Nothing too much to write home about food too one can not really qualify it as best in class five star cuisine Mind you even the corporate event price tag be not at low side the overall feeling be of an establishment run in los Hope they go back to their past glory soon we have our Offsite arrange here for 140 employee and as you know its not an easy task to manage the logistic food and accommodation Angsana team ensure everything be perfect Accommodation well keep room with clean bathroom bed welcome us we have close to 60 room book and hear no complaint from anyone which prove the service quality Food Services Yashwanth Singh serve lip smack buffet for Breakfast Lunch and Dinner Excellent service by the service staff as well overall a great culinary experience the Aappam live counter we set attract a lot of folk Banquet Kamala and team ensure the hall be ready and preppe before the event the high tea we arrange be always on time and the seat be arrange as per our demand all the time she ensure our requirement be meet all the time the resort may be good for day outing and for group this be not a really great option for family the restaurant may serve only buffet and if you nee ala carte you only have option for room service so you be second grade if you do n t take buffet it overrated and high price resort Food very average be there on the Ramzan day disappoint to see no biriyani for lunch try to get a time slot for the Spa but it be completely book Staff be very courteous locate not very far from the centre of the city but definitely away from the traffic we narrow on this resort for a group outing with family after read good review on web and we be extremely happy to have make it here right from the facility and book detail on phone to the entire experience of stay it be smooth right through Ms Zenobia help us do our booking with our requirement with ease she be forthcoming in make call from her side too the drive to the resort be easy the moment we enter the campu we be amazed by the

full of praise for the spread Special mention of Mr Kumar and Chef in charge who look after guest personally the live counter at the breakfast be quick and have enough variety for everyone choice we have book a room for our personal get together and it be set up very well by the organiser the pool change room Steam and Sauna be superb the lush green gras garden and flora be indeed captivating Must mention the involvement of the manager Mr Subramanya who speak to us for our need and ensure that our stay would be a memorable one Thank you Angsana for a fabulous stay we make a quick 1 day visit to angsana on 2nd June to celebrate a birthday as always it be a memorable experience the property manager Mr Subramania make sure that all your request and need will be meet with he definitely

nice and a beautiful getaway not too far from the city my daughter enjoy the pool to the core and write a beautiful note for them the property Manager Mr Subramany be very professional warm and welcoming we would soon visit it with our friend i have a great time in spa the massage be extremely relaxing and would surely come back Staff be really good Place be very quiet and refreshing freshnes in the air and natural beauty be ice on the cake we think this may be a good getaway from Bangalore hence the stay get a reservation be a herculean task the sale manager only respond a maximum of once a day after much prodding if you have a query to an email he have send you will get a response only the next day even if you have respond within minute of his email after several day we have the booking in place we arrive at the property after the bag be unload and everybody get out one be inform that there be no valet parking so i put the hand carry bag back in the car and then go out to park in the designate area Check in be smooth front desk staff be helpful throughout we be escort to the room the room be fairly well appoint the aircon in the living area be not cool enough we have to use the fan as well one of the tv be not work the spa close at 6 00pm who do that at a resort although we arrive at 5 00pm we could not use the spa that day we be not up to it the next day just our son use the spa the service be good at the spa although quite over the top in term of pricing the property be reasonably well maintain give a good ambience the food serve at dinner be mediocre Breakfast be a forgettable experience 1 Idlis werehard an dry they stick to the cloth at the bottom of the vessel it be place in 2 Uthappams same problem dry and stick to the cloth in the serve dish 3 the fresh poori be palatable as be the sabji 4 the omelette be reasonably good 5 they do not have salt and pepper dispenser when i want salt and pepper for the omelette after much discussion and think they bring out two bowl of pepper and salt 6 Coffee be just cold milk with a dash of coffee terrible the lunch be a well experience the quality of the food be well than dinner and breakfast Overall it be not an experience that one would like to remember quite forgettable and definitely not worth the ridiculous amount they charge under the guise of a high end resort locate just within an hour drive from the city of bangalore be this beautifully landscape spa resort of angsana many of the picture do nt do justice to the beauty of the place calm and soothing environ beautifully landscaped and good service Food be amazing should mention the lahori chicken and chowk ki tikki surprise us with a complimentary gajar ka halwa which be wonderful a perfect getaway for the city dwell kind like me could nt experience the spa this time but rest of the facility be amazing Pool tenni squash child play area be good a must visit for sure we have a perfect two day of tranquility away from the hustling bustle city life Appreciation go in for the entire team along with the GM of the property for have make the upgrade of the room to extend excellent hospitality the child enjoy the pool and the recreation club to the full to the extend that they want to stay back for a couple of day more good place to check in and unwind wither your tirednes enjoy the spa and the pool the room be fantastic with amazing view and facility a wide variety in the buffet menu make it a perfect meal everytime stay with friend for a short getaway the lawn be well maintain and the property be well spread out and be beautiful however the pool could do with a bit of cleaning the room we be give be face the back wall and be not what we be look for these be the bad room on the property i think the mini fridge in the room be not work and the AC be not cool adequately the room look rundown a bit another point be that the restaurant do not have enough item on room service after 10 30 so that s a bit of a hassle however they be kind enough to send us some dessert to the room the staff be polite and helpful Breakfast be good however not very attentive staff here the coffee be cold and we could not get a hot one visit this so call resort in Mar end we be two family with kid to unwind on a weekend the experience be horrible the air conditioner be not work so we be juggle between room till midnight the staff be indifferent and senior manager incapable of handle the situation Mr Subramaniam be discourteous and arrogant he do not bother to help us in any manner good to avoid this place a well build resort with spacious room and balcony have a nice swimming pool tenni court spa gym and the like it be a way from the bustling noise of the city but within drive distance for a weekend getaway with family the food be a nice spread too a perfect weekend getaway destination one stop shop for spa sauna swim pool and great food highly recommend for small quick getaway with friend and family to relax after a week of hard work an Amazing place locate outside of Bangalore we have a event here last week they have an amazing staff extremely flexible and they seem to cater to any eventuality meal timing last minute glitch nothing seem too difficult an Phenomenal Banquet team lead by Purushothaman and Komala definitely come back with team for a less stressful day out Lol we stay over the weekend in a double room suite when we arrive the Manager himself come to meet and welcome us Chicken Tikka Masala serve in the lunch be really good the property be ideal to relax around the wind pool and the lush green lawn since it be a birthday celebration that we be there for special arrangement in form of a candlelight dinner be organise by them sup cool Dinner be really good with a lot of variety the soup serve be excellent and later in the night we also receive the cake as promise in our room what a warm and friendly stay the room be good and our room be even decorate by the staff with balloon Breakfast spread be very good with ample of choice from South Indian to Continental Would recommend this place to other without any hitch Nice Place to stay i be there with a corporate group and stay for 1 night and 2 full day the place be nice to stay but as the day progress service level drop no room service at night they be equip well to manage a large crowd a chao at the lunch and dinner place difficult to get cutlery water and even refill of food Food be ok as usual at Buffet vegetarian be conveniently ignore the place be very expensive unless you get a good discount on bulk booking i stay here for 2 day for a busines conf it be a good resort to spend time with family or just to relax Food be okay sort but the landscape be amazing staff be courteous Spacious and clean room for stay over all good place far away from the noisy city peaceful and quite mid session break and you just step out into a fabulous lawned area extremely cooperative staff good food and service room be musty but i gues it be due to the overall natural ambiance a must for Corporate event we finish of with our corporate event last week here truly a thrilling place to be away from the hustle bustle we have a training program and it be very well take care of the food and the service be really exceptional Puro Kamala Kiran ensure all be take care of Chef make sure we be well fed a special thank to these guy so we get to the room and one of the bathroom stink beyond belief Its attach to the bedroom and hence the bedroom stink too and this be a 2 bedroom suite after at least 3 call to housekeeping one guy come in with a bathroom spray this be after we tell them that this be beyond what a spray can fix the room still stink then come lunch Dear staff at Angsana if you can not serve a decent meal at 12 30 dont promise your guest a decent meal at 12 30 just tell them 1 and they will come 1 onwards first of all the food wasnt serve at 12 30 surprise and secondly Cold food if i want cold food i would have just pack some on my way here you just serve the food how can it be cold the first request to serve us hot food go to deaf ear the second concern raise to a man that look like a supervisor have him give me a cheeky which dish all of them sir thank you very much and the third ask for a manager have me drum my finger on the table for a while before eventually pick up my phone to write this review my friend be sick and all she want be a decent hot meal which apparently be too much to ask for i have a training program and the property be excellent Food be excellent the staff be very helpful very nice atmosphere the training hall facility can be improve overall a good experience you will enjoy this property in a nice complex in the middle of nowhere this complex of building have no particular taste or architectural beauty the garden be very nice and keep quite clean and in good order the rest room include be to forget room be huge and quite desert Furniture il quite used and old insufficient low value the cleanlines be just acceptable the bathroom be large the shower poor for a place with this level of ambition the restaurant offer a breakfast in my opinion quite poor in quality Bottled juice in India fry egg that seem omelette poor variety of international item the swimming pool whereas clean well every morning collect the fall flower and leave from the many plant around the bar be awfully expensive and the service be very poor for the price of a good european 4 start hotel this complex can not offer anything well than a poor service poor room and tableware often dirty a last minute plan to visit angasana have really make my day the property be amazing lush green beautiful landscape Awesome weather it a cherry on the cake the calmnes here have make a perfect afternoon the food and service be a finish touch to perfect afternoon for anyone look for an idol place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of the city Angasana be the good place for it check in to the resort as a part of a surprise from my family for my birthday we stay in the Villas which be ideal for our requirement to be spend quality time with family the resort be within a gate community and hence away from the hustle and bustle of Doddaballapur main road Staff spare no effort to ensure the guest be well attend to the food be good but add in more variation could help as it tend to get a bit monotonous when avail it on the trot all in all a great experience while the stay food be ok the service be really disappointing i have a special request to be cater because it be my husband s bday Nothing be do effectively Multiple reminder and they go and ask my husband itself if they have to serve the cake while that be suppose to be a surprise also when ask for a headache medicine they tell me to go out and take it that be least expect while the price be high expectation be that the service have to be good not worth that much money i have send email on my feedback and i still have n t get a response not recommend Stay and room ok type game be decent Food be horrible service be pathetic Lunch have one starter dinner have no starter some of the food item smell stale they donot even bother to refill the food item once finish Breakfast suck big time all of us be wait in queue to get food and their staff be busy on phones games or chat not even bother to work Staff be not train properly no handwash basic near dining area we ve to walk to near rest room in another floor we order coffee at room service by the time it arrive it be cold and disgusting and get charge nearly 450 Bar be ok type bar tender do n t know how to mix drink no mocktail or cocktail SPA be super expensive so do nt try one massage will cost you 7k 10k 28 taxis sadly it no longer the good resort in Bangalore i last visit this place for a corporate offsite 4 year ago and since then it look exactly the same but with more crack and tear all around scream for attention while the surround garden and the outdoor property be very well maintain the room nee a major makeover i stay in room 2009 on the first floor and the upp wall closer to the ceiling roof be crack chip with peel paint if the room be dismissal the bathroom be in a furth state of disrepair crack basin counter broken shelf and leak water faucet i could n t get to have the hand shower work and there be water leak from all side i also suspect if they provide 24 hour hot water service as the water in my bath be barely lukewarm another peeve be the bath towel provide once white and fluffy they look dull and work out the same with the bed linen be anyone pay attention to these detail it appear that only one of the restaurant be operational the sundance and the food also leave a lot to be desire i think what need be not a big buffet spread but one that reasonably sized with freshnes and quality i honestly think the vegetable in the salad look very dead and meek the only positive for me at this point would be the ever willing and helpful staff around the property they be not the best train but be very sincere about their job to meet customer expectation despite its flaw this resort be still very popular with the corporate for host team offsite event and while this be evident during my stay this week i seriously doubt if i ll recommend my corporation to consider this place in the future it high time the management take notice of these issue and act upon them rather than continue to run this place on its past glory and reputation we have a lovely time at Angsana last weekend the room be spacious we have a one bedroom suite the landscape garden be a perfect place to relax and unwind they have maintain the place very well Would love to go back rightly name this be an Oasis in a middle of no where a very beautiful and well do up property which be easy to acces but at the same time not in busy city chao the check in be breeze the room be huge gues most of us get mini or duplex suite and all have a sit out or balcony overlook the green oth cottage villa in front in some case the decor be decent but the air conditioning since it be split AC be not effective and efficient but be good weather it be not much a concern in the day of HD the TV be SD and load with more of regional and local content if you be look for HIndi and English very limited choice charge point be limit to study table and none around the bedside which be weird Bathroom be fair size but what i find most uncomfortable be miss Hand Towels and no tumbler for your tooth brush etc the hand shower in our room 2037 be break and the rain shower be chock Service be poor i understand its a resort but still very poor Housekeeping phone never get connect have to leave message at reception have request iron which be not there as room amenity and it never turn up till end of day despite repeat follow up at night before retire i again check about it and be tell they have only iron and no board and later tell that all the iron be out with oth guest and i would be give one early morning at 6 i finally get one at 7 30 after a follow call 10 minute later they come knock at the door to collect the iron as some oth guest need it i be not do with the job hence request some time on which i be tell oth guest need it too where be this aggression when i wait the whole day if that be not all in 2 minute no exaggeration oth person come for the iron i be like what Most of our meal be serve at Sundance the open cafe near the pool the food be average and need to be improve even the local dish do n t have the right flavor and appeal no comment absolutely on oth region dish i find almost all the plate bowl not very clean despite check the whole lot of them the live counter be okay and the spread average with not much choice the most disappointing be no hand wash area in the restaurant one have to go to the health centre wash room the bar have a good deck area a good place to chill and relax the pool be decent and i be glad they be particular about the dres code for swimmer overall a good place which need a bit of pull up to be call as an excellent getaway it 5 star but they have to improve lot Lawn be maintain very well kid will feel bored Food be average Price be very premium room be ok Service need improvement Easy to reach the location i have stay 1 night with 20 of my friend stay here on a monsoon get away package the property be nice with lush green lawn and manicure landscaped garden but the service and food be terrible as for Service i get a call in my room at 10 40pm that they have arrange for a candle light dinner for us as we be celebrate our anniversary Nice of them but whose idea be it to call at 1040 to check on dinner and if they have take the pain how about inform the guest about the plan then i be tell that the cake will be send to the room yes the cake do come but at 11 45pm disturb my sleep yet again Damn irritating be n t the word then Food quality be pathetic and high tea mean just tea as the snack pakodas be over by 530 and i see the guest wait for the great Pakodas to arrive Overall pretty bad experience may as well stay away i have go with my memory from almost 8 year back when angsana be one of the top rate resort but ala with time it have lose its sheen if youre look for a quick weekend getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city of Bangalore Angsana be only an hour away from the city center locate along the Doddaballapur main road it be around 8 10 km from the international airport flyover the road and approach be good the property be a sprawl one with well landscape garden well lay out and its easy to find your way around while it be a bit dated it be decently maintain and the room size and space be certainly a delight we put up in a one bedroom suite which be far big than the average suite size and area the suite have a separate dining sit out area and two balcony two TV set in the dining and room as well Room also have oth standard amenity such as Safe deposit locker tea coffee maker mini fridge View from all room be nice since the property be part of a large residential layout also own by Prestige group that own Angsana there be lot of trail to take nice morning or evening walk in amidst nature there be three restaurant within the campu one of them which also double up as a bar serve drink however the service level be far from what youd expect at a five star rate property i be not so sure if it be because we visit on a long weekend and they be book to full capacity or otherwise but certainly either which way youd expect well service and hospitality at a rate star property as this the room service be very poor their line be down for 30 min and we be unable to get through and upon visit the restaurant they dont seem very happy to offer you a la carte for some reason compel customer to opt for the buffet the food be quite average in taste quality and serve or plating restaurant have very little variety in term of cuisine its mostly Indian continental fare be very limited the complimentary breakfast be OK though especially the south Indian fare be quite good but all in all pretty poor in the F B department People around the staff in general dont seem very courteous and seem to be very preoccupied with i dont know what to care about customer yes youll go out of here with some good memory such as the beauty of the property per se the Xtra large swimming pool and the well landscaped spacious room this place boast of but again here be some of the aspect you nee to be wary of 1 no free Wifi charge at 700 buck a day seriously 2 Place isnt very infant handicap friendly i say this because pathway be heavily ridged at many place lot of level and there be no ramp in quite a few place undulate landscape make it tough if you be use a pram stroller or a wheelchair 3 Hot water be an issue i also hear oth people complain at the reception about this suite do not have bathtub positive be definitely 1 Room space and size 2 Property be beautifully landscape with garden flower plant fruit tree and a green haven 3 Spa have a lot of option to suit various prize range and preference 4 Huge Pool with artificial fall 5 lot of oth amenity be list in the property description leaflet oth than spa and pool outdoor indoor game library etc though i think many of them be not existent non operational all in all its still up there if this property wasnt rate a 5 star i think if the management be to fix a few of these issue and improve their service level they certainly have it all to become a much well much more value 5 star property we have a fabulous stay at Angsana for 02 night with consist of 41 pax for conference event all staff be very helpful and quick service provide even dinner be provide at late night around 01 30 AM Mr Hemanth Mr Venkatesh Mr Sridhar have do excellent job and even in the reception Good luck team i gues its my mistake that even after read so many review i choose this place as many people have mention food be just ok absolutely no thing spl Landscape be good that s it nothing more on ve side start from brunch on Sunday everything have be go from bad to bad to nightmare 1st of all the brunch timing be at 12 30 and previous night dinner end 10 30 there be no prop seating arrangement make in the dining area we have to wait for 30 min just to get seat the brunch be open to general public as there be a sudden surge of people out of no where if this be open to public you guy nee to make sure people who have pay high price to select your resort to stay be give 1st priority you ca nt be so careless they nee to be have properly seat the food menu be almost empty by the time we get our plate in our hand we be tell to wait 5 min for refill but that refill happen 30mins later by then we have lose our appetite NOTE since we do not have breakfast we be force to order room service from the exorbitant price menu Neat trick here Correct right who can live without food basic do nt give them breakfast provide them brunch at 12 30 so that they order food by pay hefty price do nt mind that too since it be our anniversary i be in no mood to get upset later when i tell the reception that it be our anniversary and ask them if it be possible to arrange some basic food they say they will tell by 9 that 9pm never come if they have tell me on the face or decline it would n t have care why play game and upon that they tell these thing need to be inform before hand so that they can arrange candle light dinner cake etc i be pretty sure i have tell you during the booking and the reason to choose the garden suite instead of executive room since it be a spl occasion i never ask them for a candle light cake the request be quite simple and it be polite request which could have be decline upfront Forget that i have be call room service and reception from 8 30 PM to get me 2 pint of beer the reception say i ca nt smoke i be tell him i have a garden suite and a Jacuzzi i will be outdoor when i smoke and not inside the room when i drink smoke it be some moral policing go on here Its be wait for 2 hour and no1 be even bother to inform if the food can be arrange nor have the room service arrive finally at 10pm we go to have dinner and an absolute shocker we be pure veg be about to drink chicken soup when i ask the waiter he say sorry Simple plain do even mean the sorry call the manger he tell there be many kid play they may have mess it up i mean what the hell its their job to check these thing and that i be be charge right now during checkout i will also say sorry my card be not work so i ca nt pay the balance will you guy be ok i be write this during my checkout as i be wait to just step out of this so call 4 5 place mainly a resort to be enjoy during weekend as on weekday there can be corporate group land up which can get noisy Set in a very large expansive property the resort offer a big swimming pool world clas spa beautiful room to stay which have living room and bed room with huge verandah not very far from Bangalore on Doddaballapur Road it be a quiet place with beautiful setting strongly recommend this place for those try to have a calm weekend away from hustle hustle of Bangalore Amazing place for high energy kid as well as they offer a lot of activity for kid Food be average though Good property green lush lawn and landscaping well maintained and lush green lawn be spread over a large area have many facility like squash spa swimming pool kid play area etc They food choice be fine and one can find food of his liking this can be a good place for a short break from the madnes of large city however the property be in need of an upliftment The room be get wear down the cutlery pale and the towel bedsheet etc nee an upgrade the management must invest some amount to bre the much needed upgradation of facility Overall a good place for a short break to unwind and relax this be in fact flawlessly do then i nee to thank Subramanya Hemant Venkatesh and his team to have help me and have support me form the start till the finish it wouldnt be fair if i didnt mention a special thank to Mukesh Sudharshan Sharath Murali for ensure to get all the check in do on a timely manner i should say they have a knack to handle every guest many thank to the boy at the lobby who have help us with the welcome drink and luggage to the room every load that they carry be heavy but they smile Smile be a wonderful thing and they all have it and my sincere thank to Ms Kamala for keep up with our time and take that extra effort to get the coffee sort from the coffee shop i call her Ms Prestige she know what the guest need before even they could ask all of the above my sincere thank to the house keep staff to help us with clean rooms hygiene be basic but to do it in style be fantastic they do it it will me my honor to appreciate the effort of Chef to give us some great buffet at Sun Dance and Bosco stay here between the 8th and the 10th of this month Family outing with an elderly lady require wheelchair assistance too have read several of the poor service review on this space it be with some trepidation that i go ahead and book the place what a wonderfully pleasant contrast await us from the time of park the car at the entrance portico it be a high level of personal attention and care Mahesh at the reception be exceptional the staff have no hesitation in come over to the room any number of time with the wheelchair for my mother in law Room service too be prompt what we like best be this the staff trainee there be from all part of the country they be all very young not all of them speak good english but they more than make up with their infectious enthusiasm and eagernes to be of service that level of motivation be incredible the spa part of the resort be highly professional and the service of a very high quality completely worth the charge levy in fact all of us go there more than once or twice the food spread be average but the chef and staff go out of their way to personally attend to us suggest dish and even conjure up food not on the regular spread be everything Utopian definitely no one of the good part of the resort be the open to the garden balcony of the Bar on both day however this be let out to some coroporate event prevent us from use that space the estate manager have to be a little more diligent in the maintenance of the cottage the covered AC duct be in disrepair with water drip in the sit out area of the room there be plant grow out the crevice in the wall the garden chair nee upholstering they have soak all the rain water and freely give it out when you sit on them spend a couple of day with old friend at the Resort find it to be over price and service largely unsatisfactory while the garden be well maintain room be very small and cramped lack basi amenity like mini fridge wi fi Service be quite poor for tea and snack we have to wait one and a half hour for some ice 45 minute Food just passably good not worth the price they charge our family of 4 have book for a 2 bedroom Suite through Mr Irshan from the sale office who patiently respond to all our query and suggest a good deal when we check in our original booked room have some technical glitch and to make up for that we be shift to another accommodation to our surprise the manager in charge Mr Hemant shift us to the Presidential suit which have its own private jet pool massage chair vast sit out Mr Hemant graciously attempt to make up for the initial inconvenience we be put to which be clearly a reflection of the value that Angsana uphold the Customer be the king the staff be courteous and helpful the greenery around you offer you the much require tranquility and the offering of the Spa adventure and indoor game give you the right mix of relaxation and excitement the phone line for housekeeping or room service and handling of customize service request can get improve a recommendable gateway within reach from the city have a Business Conference at angsana enjoy our stay there with the ambiance a welcome contrast to the brainstorming session in the conference the hotel be always ready to conform to our requirement and everything be do smoothly Great work by the manager Kamala and her team they anticipate our wish and be ready when we need them thank a lot guy i be write this while at the resort my one day night sojourn with family turn out to be a nightmare Room service be non existent Person take room service order lie about the order time to cover up for the delay even after wait for 1hr15mins dinner never come my 6yr old kid go to sleep without dinner Pathetic and this kind of treatment borderline on harassment if you do n t have enough people to cater to guest you announce that there be no room service Will save people time and harassment be not connect to the manager even after request multiple time the room have date furniture not really 5 star as advertise Food be strictly decent Nothing great Landscape be the only save grace of this resort maybe spa but we do n t use so ca n t say Overall leave a bad taste and do n t know if i will ever consider this again pro Good place Check in be smooth we be upgrade to the next high room category thank you guy Lovely campu Clean room and comfortable bed Cons no Free Wi Fi seriously for the amount charge they could not offer free wi fi i be offer if i d like to buy wi fi who do that these day Unresponsive staff it take me 1 5 hour just to have a menu card deliver to my room why be n t it there in the first place no one know it require umpteen number of follow up i actually offer to walk down and get the menu card if the gentleman at the oth end could ve instruct me where to come TV remote be miss its battery cover owe to which the battery keep slip out Air Conditioning be very old and non functional i d to switch on the fan along with the sloppy air conditioning to enjoy my time in the room no HD channel in the TV seriously for the price i be pay i could not get HD channel Food not at all impressive for the size and clas of the property i d not like to go back there because of no free Wi Fi and the pathetic service this property be from Prestige construction which be a reputed brand in Bangalore this also be a fairly old and establish resort be a Prestige property the room building and landscaping be good the USP of this place just stop there nothing else to talk about it advertise as a 5 star resort but it truly be not Property and room Medium sized resort with well maintain landscaping room seem to have be renovate recently Old and Noisy ac in the room though Food strictly AVERAGE price be premium food be average at best Facilities Spa be the main activity here along with a medium sized pool oth activity be non existent or poorly maintain the pay activity area can be compare to a road side temporary setup you find in the village fair child will get bored Service DOWRIGHT PATHETIC this be one cost cutting case worth an example of how to not do the staff be mostly local who can not converse in Hindi English very few prompt decision maker around the team entirely seem lose and without purpose no smile greeting from staff everyone seem to focu on their own task and how not turn it in to a mes it do not seem like a happy place Service overall be leave to last level staff if you be lucky you will get ok service after struggle with communicate what you want for my family vacation this turn out to be really frustrating experience with front desk staff just exchange the card key without really understand that the lock could have an issue staff who do not know how to swipe the credit card and so on this place run on corporate booking and best suited for those type of scenario not for family for sure we run a week long training course for my company s Asia Pacific sale team during March 2017 the resort facility and staff be good and the accommodation of a decent quality i would recommend this as an excellent destination for corporate retreat great meeting room and support facility Thank you to Purushottam Anil Walavalkar for her attentive support we have team off site very recently must say you guy get a place which people would love to be there for the rest of the life individual from Security staff to Front desk personnel they always have the good thing a guest would ask SMILE Reason why i have give Average rating above be for the pathetic dinner you have serve to us we re force to eat salad though we re not diet i believe improve that will make my feedback from Average to Excellent i look forward for the improvement as we love this place the property be nice huge and well maintain situate away from the hustle bustle of the city Would be a good place for a day s outing or even if you be look for a short break for a couple of day frequently visit by corporate for team outing Overall service be quite prompt a lot of activity within the resort to keep you busy Good spread for all the meal but the menu could have be a little well if you want to stay here without need to ask for any service from the hotel guy you can survive but once you ask them for something your struggle begin first even the reception person can not speak and understand either Hindi or English they call it a five star Second food serve at the restaurant be mostly cold Third it take them 45 minute to serve milk to me that to not as i want it Fourth they have some lousy DTH service you nee a special training on how to change channel or how to find channel of your choice Fifth like a PG most of their service close before expect time Spa close at 6 pm restaurant at 1030 pm game at 0830 pm nobody pic up the phone at room service even at 0645 am the infrastructure they have be decent but they nee to work a lot on manage this property they staff be polite but that not enough if you fail to provide the basic service go to the resort in April for a meeting stay there for a night the place be far away from the city and the airport too but it seem that the concept the place nicely plan and well maintain Health club be nice place and give special attention Swimming pool be also clean two restaurant and bar be well equip but if u ask for brand at bar they will propably will have only 2 3 option generally the staff be well mannered and help nature Food quality be decent in Indian menu a place about 20 km from airport and about 50 km from City centre majestic a good place to chill out Do visit if u r with family or in a group we stay here with family few day ago the property be nice mostly visit by corporate for team outing team building etc my dad book us a two storey bungalow here and the booking experience be excellent the room though seem a bit dingy and not modern in any way with dark heavy duty furniture and balcony door please change the mattress on the bed give us a backache coz it be so soft out of shape my infant be not too fond of be in the room as it be so dark even during day time when it be sear hot outside lol the pool be great we have a blast there overall well maintain garden and property my main grouse be the food which be way below average the spread be not wow in any way barely any option for fish or seafood i ask for banana for the baby and be give half ripe one they be perpetually confused where to send us to eat as their main restaurant be book by the corporate biggie one morning there be no omlette counter in breakfast buffet one big thumb up to Swapna the health club staff who go out of her way to help us out and clarify thing kudo to her attitude she a gem also be nt free wifi the call of our time i mean who charge for it in today s day anyhow we get the family time and fun time we go there for so it be okay PS this resort be not

in Crisis management on the first day itself the foreign guest have issue with the spice level in food before this could be blow out of proportion he very carefully handle the situation along with his team of chef and their staff the situation be quickly diffuse and no one ever speak about it even the tea session be so lively highlight be the special cookie bake in their own bakery on the premise Ms Kamala and her team do an awesome job the chef be ably support by Amit Rahul and Kumar overall an awesome show while i receive the accolade these be the real hero behind the scene a big THANK you to Angsana and team as we have happy guest at the hotel which be most important we have showcase international standard to the foreign guest who be apprehensive about the venue i look forward to many more such event here and will recommend the same to other cheer martin Beautiful property and that too very close to Bangalore CBD Large and very spacious room well maintain lawn positive stop there the room be unduly large and that cause a problem of too much and unplanned furniture the equipment inside include the air conditioner be very dated Staff nee a lot more training and more particularly the staff in the restaurant Food be so repetitive that you feel fatigued if u stay for even two day May be time for them to change some fo these thing to ensure the property get the rating it deserve i visit this place very often with my family because it our favourite weekend stays and initially we use to have problem with book room i bet most of you will be face same issue if you call the

spend the weekend at Angsana in Bangalore and have a terrible experience Sower fitting and the intercom and door lock be n t work in my villa room when i complain the front office could n t understand when i speak to the manager Hemant he be discourteous aggressive obnoxious rude boorish and downright hostile hardly hospitality if you ask me in the morning there be no hot water and after call the reception from my mobile no intercom 9 time and wait for an hour i take a cold shower finally they overcharge my by r 5000 and give me the correct bill of r 9000 only after i point this excess amount out to Sudarshan the front office guy he try justify it say it be a printer mistake whatever that be suppose to mean i have write a letter of complaint to Zenobia who take my booking and Prestige to voice my anger at such horrible service Avoidable resort imo the i care a damn attitude of the staff a 5 star Spa Resort have that different aura which elate you as soon as you enter the property no such feeling here strictly average ambiance make bad by the age infrastructure seem the owner be not so interested in run the property anymore to start with they can not even provide Wine and Whiskey glass in the room and the reason give be they do not have any my Son forget his skatescooter in the lawn somewhere and we immediately call the front desk and the housekeeping individually both casually reply we will search for it it be only us with our own effort who find it with some fellow guest the next morning no one call us to check on the statu talk about food a 1200 r buffet have only 12 dish to talk about Same go with the Breakfast spread the room service staff do not know the detail about the dish they serve and casually talk as if it be a road side eatery not hint of anybody senior from the staff walk around whom you can talk to basically the resort have start take guest for grant and its a bad bad sign honestly speak we do not like nothing as such no good memory we take back with us even if there be any be cloud by the totally careless attitude of the staff Would not recommend it to anyone we have 2 day meet at Angsana Beautiful place the entire team of angsana be very friendly the room be good and food be also great overall our 2 day stay be great only issue we face be on the WIFI plan to stay for 2 night with my wife and baby at Angsana as we just need to take a break from our hectic life and be n t this a good decision we choose the suite and to our delight it be a massive room the hall have lot of space despite the sofa and dining table the mini bar and tea coffee maker be in the hall TV unit in both the bedroom as well as the hall and 2 fully equip bathroom mean smile checkin guest we have lot of luggage thank to the little one but we never have an issue with move thing around as the staff be very helpful the reception need to be design better and man by a professional which be n t the case and check in and check out take a while we have only one buffet lunch at the resort and it have good variety and taste be very nice they have an amazing pool which we do n t get to dip in but take some photograph atop the little bridge on top the oth facility like indoor play area squash and badminton court be well maintain we visit the spa and love the experience it have a very good decore and the massage be very professional and super relaxing unfortunately we have to leave much earlier than expect due to a contingency but love the experience overall in term of food facility and value full mark i mostly stay at this property during my visit to Bangalore it get good location excellent room staff its General Manger Mr Vivek himself take care of everything and mostly available at the reception to make sure customer service be good its my favorite property in Bangalore the stay and the room be very nice but have an issue with the reservation i book through booking com for 2 day but when i want to extend my stay for a furth 2 day the charge be hike up by another 1000 r since i be do the reservation at the counter ideally would have prefer the same online rate should have be continue for the additional day Good location and staff be very cooperative be here for 2nights and it be very comfortable and hygnic room face towards brigade road enjoy my stay Would recommend to my friend and family and will for sure will stay again AC be very noizy not Tere be no balcony as show in the picture at the time of booking towel be very bad Breakfast be fine some sort of fragrance shoil be there room look like gloomy Average refer customer rating i be impressed and i could meet the expectation also however only observation for improvement be to have prop air circulation in bathroom it do n t have an effective air duct hence there be lot of suffocation and strong smell Rest all be good i stay here for 4 night no complaint about room or food but front desk staff nee to be more responsive to guest s concern after i check in to the room i hear heavy hammer noise from the floor above me i call front desk to inform about the noise but the staff rudely say its not our problem then i go down and request for room change at the front desk they say room be be clean and they will call me once room be available gues what they never call me back after a couple of hour the hammering noise stop so i do not bother them for room change so the management should train their staff to be more sensitive and responsive to the guest s concern otherwise the stay be ok Could not fault anything with the hotel Location be great as it be right on Brigade Road itself Breakfast buffet spread be amazing choice of Indian Continental and egg to order Would definitely visit again the first thing i do after this visit be to delete an early good review that i have post in TripAdvisor the hotel be my regular one for all my Bangalore Visits and most of the visit be before the treebo tie up hence do n t search for a second choice to book since i think it should be still good the only thing that be improve be the elevator and rest everything so poor start from the cleanlines of the room Wash room Breakfast serve the bed comfort almost everything that i experience be pathetic we travel as a family for 2 night and 3 day the location of the hotel be excellent while be bang on Brigade road its sufficiently tuck in that you be not disturb by the action on Brigade the room be reasonably large for 2 adult and a 10 year old the staff be pretty courteous but the check in do take quite some time give that the staff be multi tasking between me and another guest i arrive a hour earlier than the check in time but the staff be able to allocate a room the room have a split air conditioner which i presume be never clean in age had some stale smell a quick look inside reveal a filter that be scream to be clean unfortunately the room do n t sport a fan which mean we have to do with the AC the linen do n t feel fresh but be ok not sure if this be the cause for some rash that take a day to subside for my son the bathroom need quite a bit of upkeep the health faucet be hardly work shower be good but the layout be pretty bad get the whole bathroom floor wet after each shower no panel shower curtain the breakfast spread be decent predominantly south Indian cuisine taste wise be average nothing spectacular but nothing to complain significantly about the good part of the stay be the friendly and courteous staff Parking be good they have decent basement parking give the location and the staff if the management be to take care of maintain the room and the amenity better this hotel could be a good winner very nice hotel in hart of the city on Brigade road and very near to MG road 200 meter and with

bathroom and on the buffet table in the morning we leave the place the next day and find a well place not worth the money we stay there for 5 day our plan be for r 4000 taxis include both breakfast and dinner when we be pay for the plan at the front desk we be tell that we can order anything from the menu and it will be cover in the dinner plan however the first night we go for dinner on the 5th floor terrace we be tell that our plan call MAP something include one starer and one main course item either of which can be non veg with veg soup salad rice chapati and dessert although we be communicate something else we though we be n t go to eat more than this anyways so we let it go on the third night we be tell that MAP client have their dinner in the first floor where some ICICI programme be go on the buffet dinner spread there be nowhere close to what we be order for the last two day we refuse to take dinner there the hotel staff grudgingly serve us on fourth day they again insist that we take our dinner with ICICI guy which we refuse and they serve us only now the time they take to bre each dish be more than 15 20 minute one can imagine the amount of time we waste for our dinner finally the rice we order take so long to arrive that we leave our dinner table the last night the same ritual follow only this time they bring us stale vegetable for the mixed veg we order i take one bite and i know it be stale my colleague smell it and it smell stale they throw in some cucumber and onion piece to pas off as salad as oppose to a full platter they offer on previous day Nobody bother to serve water we keep ask the waiter to get the restaurant manager to our table so we could talk he never arrive he know what he be do be blatantly illegal and even refuse to come talk to us anyways this be the harrowing experience we go through there and i hold the restaurant manager completely responsible for it Avoid this hotel if you can at the same price you ll get much well option in Bangalore stay over here for 2 day the hotel be well maintain with good and supportive staff the location be not that good in term of front view otherwise its locate near to city center the buffet breakfast be good with south indian dish the roof top bar be excellent the night view from the roof top be wonderful Good and helpful staff the swimming pool be not upto the mark look like a water pond they have provide me 24 hour check in and check out which help me a lot in plan my next travel thank to the hotel management what i have understand from whatever little travel i have make

stay here in July 18 on an official trip the room be big spacious which may not be easily available elsewhere within the city at the rate they be offer the buffet breakfast have a widespread which include Indian as well Continental option apart from a live dosa uttapam counter the only sore point be the locality as the property be situate within autospare repair shop they have a rooftop lounge which be good for relax after a hard day work one can have a view of the city at night i have book this Booking com for 2 day stay the picture show over the sight be really eye catch as show close by to Richmond Sq Banglore i couldnt stop myself to book it but the experience be not upto the mark Ambience of the Hotel good but the roadside entrance be very dirty it be the only property close by to Urvashi Cinema but the locality be unable to explain it have not concierge service Long room but not comfort inside very limit staff Buffet breakfast item in menu be much more good no doubt but attention towards customer be less but cant help in the location even though they improve their service i have immidiatly cancel the one day stay and rush to oth Hotel all the good Location be not that good although it be easily accessible cab availability to the hotel be very poor during peak time we wait almost an hour at 8 30 in the night to get an ola cab or auto Auto in front of the hotel be charge very high rate oth than that stay be comfortable Good break fast and good room service the white theme of the hotel be fantastic and very pleasant Enough light in all room room be big enough

MRT which be just 2 3 min walk over all a good experience room be very good also hotel inside amenity be very good it be a very good hotel to stay for professional and personnel trip Out side road cleaning be a improvement point surround cleaning be important point of improvement i have to drag my own luggage up the stair to the lobby as there be no one to assist when i raise this to the front desk person one of them look disinterested and thankfully the oth junior person look apologetic and try to find the guard outside i m give a room key which do n t work and the boy use the master key to my room no replacement for my key post that since i arrive late that night i order room service which be okay but the next morning be a challenge especially when you have to rush for meeting the AC

of min i have no choice but to shower in cold water the breakfast be bad the towel be of low quality no hair dryer in the room be from the travel trade i do n t think this be a 4 star busines traveller pls stay away Clean basic faciltie very friendly staff Good value for money if you a royal enfield fan motorcycle then a must stay place as it next to JC road the bengaluru centre for

during my stay i would thank to Rahul and team what a kind of effort they put on their job to make us comfort i would love to come back again and stay here i have awonderful sty wth Ibis spcl thnkak to front desk staff fiza raahul Santosh and raavi surely will visit again Staff be always cheerful and hospitable room be clean and hygienic Bed be too soft and have soft pillow too the hotel be very well maintain and locate at the middle of the Bangalore centre near by cubbon park and cricket stadium you can have a good walk around in the evening i have stay very short period of time but Check in and check out very pleasant and reception staff give excellent clean room i have find room well maintain and neat Interior design fabulous i have stay oth hotel and also different city but compare to other hotel Ibis housekeeping staff s and any oth staff s be well trained and hospitality manner as well as room morden style with bath room aminitie be good quality as per my experience during stay period over all i will say good value for money but breakfast time in ground floor restaurant be a bit of a shamble plus you have to contend with music that make you feel like you be in a nightclub even if you be the only guest in the restaurant it be really LOUD i talk to the supervisor Harsheed about this and he say it be management decision seriously he agree that music in the morning should be quiet as people have just wake uo on check out the FO staff ask it everything be ok against the once again loud music i shout to them my discontent about the volume of the music seriously if management think this be on trend to hurt your eardrum first thing in the morning it do not add to a breakfast experience that should be enjoyable and will make me rethink stay here again oth than this the hotel be good location and generally good value i have be to the hotel with my friend the dinner experience be memorable love the Starters and live count food highly recommendable and i be surely come back the bar be also a nice place for a drink Great staff my membership no 3081031866603773 it be my 3rd stay in IBIS city centre Bengaluru in Feb 2019 since November 2018 i have note that every time the front desk staff ask for a high amount than the booking amount mention in the online booking receipt however after show them the online booking receipt they finally agree to accept the booking amount my booking come with a 20 discount on food bill it have be note that if the 20 discount offer be not bring to the notice of the staff they print the bill without offer the discount at the time of check out however they refund the discount amount once the mistake be bring to their notice before leave the Hotel i fail to understand why such thing should happen each time in such a repute Hotel probably there be a problem with the booking and billing software they be use to start with my loyalty to accor be more than respect i get an early check in of 830am i be offer free breakfast and a very responsive staff from the front desk to the restaurant check on my comfort at every stage the concern be such that when Uber mess up the hotel arrange a taxi in minute from Syed to Priyanka and Pramod and several other include the smile sweep boy i be make to feel at home very nice hotel and food be amazing here in spice it staff be amazing as always Good for those who like to be out with friend for a get together located at the centre of the city Coffee here be also very good stay in ibi for first time get to know ibi standard staff be very helpful especially Anil from front office Breakfast spread be very nice one suggestion Room service should be quick thanks i hope my feedback will be take care of i Vinay Kumar stay for 10days Amit Subho be house keep guy make my stay more comfortable and smooth i appreciate them and the good part be the very helpful Mr kaleem the man who be respond quickly for all the thing and Hotel offer a good choice of food to eat have a wonderful 2 night stay at Ibis City Centre Bengaluru be shock that the shift Manager Syed offer to carry my bag have be my first time in India that a Manager have do this immediately respond to my visible discomfort of carry two bag Will be great to come back and stay here stay at the property on 6th Feb totally a budget property the staff be welcome and that the only plus i see there room be so congested the bathroom be of fiber and a person wo nt fit properly in there be a heavy task take a shower no toiletry or body lotion available go down to hotel restaurant where there be no prop menu and food option i plan stay for a night but i check out earlier Bathroom be very small and congested and make with fiber so always shake while get shower shower have slow force Room size also small compare to oth same category hotel Location be good food quality also good i stay in this hotel for 2 night Staff be very helpful polite and really generous room be ok size but enough for 1 person Bathroom be small but nicely make Check in and check out proces be fast Breakfast be good but dinner be ok overall a comfortable stay if you be look at something within budget this one be pretty far away from the Bengaluru Airport and the IT office on the eastern fringe but very close to MG Road Brigade Road and the Majestic City railway station Small cozy room and offer everything the IBIS brand bring locate near the central busines district of Bengaluru this hotel be suit to all category of traveler but the young crowd will love it Practical and modern with a hep interior it definitely appeal to the young people the breakfast be good and the room be a bit smallish but well plan the bathroom be a small cubicle and all modern facility be available the price vary a lot and slightly on the costly side compare to oth similarly rate hotel stay there a year back room be small but very very well maintain and have all the modern amenity however Bathroom be very small but spotless bed be comfortable we get room at low floor so not much city view from there however the complementary breakfast be very nice and well spread staff be helpful specially the lady at front desk could not remember her name be very helpful as i be new to the place it be very nice stay in Bengaluru Service cleanlines and staff be very good Only thing be size of the room be very small comparing to oth accor hotel Location also good of course it be little away from main city but there be no problem for go any corner of the city because you will get variety of transport we book two standard room for single occupancy the room be modern and functional but both the room and the bathroom be definitely on the small side the room be perfect for us but could be a squeeze for some Its in a good central location but despite face onto a busy road my room be extremely quiet it also have good blackout blind so i get a couple of unusually good and peaceful night sleep the staff be friendly and helpful and the breakfast be good i would definitely stay here again this be a Ibis so my expectation be not the same as from a 5 star hotel but even with low expectation this place manage to disappoint me the hotel have tiny room and bed the rest room be feel like they be take from a airplane i know that be a bit harsh but if you take out the triangular shower area away what you be leave be indeed the size of an airplane restroom believe me the shower area itself be make of plastic fibre and the rubber sealing to prevent water from spill from in between the two glas door be break Worst of all be the restaurant i order a dish for dinner after have to wave atleast 4 different server then have to wait for 40 min but my order do nt arrive have to run through 2 waiter 1 restaurant manager and then the hotel duty manager to finally get the food deliver in my room after 1 hr Pathetic hotel Would not come back Excellent location make travel to most place within the city easy Friendly and helpful staff Breakfast option in the buffet be very limited Room be small with the result that some of the luggage have be leave in the locker room i have stay at many Accor hotel internationally as well as in India this property location be excellent with proximity to UB city center the breakfast be sumptuous and staff friendly and courteous overall a good experience hi this Dr M Ram Prasad stay at IBIS Bangalore for two day few month ago Hospitality be so great and location be main advantage reachable from railway station bu stand Mr Anil from front office take care of me very well through out my stay thank IBIS Standard room size very small as compare to show in pic Toilet shower seem to be an aircarft compact toilet only one point for mobile charging and that too not in work condition and no attention by reception to get the same repair or provide an alternative Website clearly state that standard room with additional benefit to include 4 alcoholic drink however only 2 be serve good hotel to stay in the staff be very friendly and the service be amazing the room be clean and amazing nice view from the room good amount of amenity in bathroom and room look forward to visit this hotel again Hotel will meet your expectation i stay for 14 day Room be nice and staff be very helpful proffesional in their behaviour specially Rahul Shukla a guy in the reception be very nice he help me at every moment from start till the checkout Excellent location property staff and service Can stay here without any hesitation right from the security usher frontdesk and restaurant staff everybody be pleasant and helpful Have stay at Ibis Paris and Sydney before but this by far beat all of them hand down kudo to the team stay for 7 day while attend a congres in Bangaluru even in a small but good construct room i feel at home it not a luxury but a very suitable hotel like in daily life once there be a technical defect in the shower cubicle repair within breakfast time if i have any need it be meet within short time with Fiza i have someone like a personal assistant and even Pryanka Pooja and all their colleague at the reception be helpfull and supportive all the time even all the doorman like Prajant be very kind and helpfull as a german traveller stay a lot of time in India over the year i enjoy the cooking of Deepak and the attentive service from Srikant Abraham Pooja Vikas Madhu and all the rest in the restaurant but different western traveller may ask for a great western offer at breakfast beside indian breakfast you will find fruit yoghurt cereal toast and jam i get a good price performance ratio but at the reception i see that price be change day by day up to an offer of about 5000 Rupees 60 incl tax and breakfast for a single room i will come again all the time so next year September on Friday 14 12 2018 when i check into this hotel on a very urgent short trip i be extremely satisfied with a energetic efficient very

Comfortable and cozy stay load with most essential amenity a comfortable bad and clean interior and essential amenity a decent food menu with less option but sufficient for your requirement Good food with fine preparation and freshnes in the menu loveibism Everything go smoothly during my recent trip we be meet on arrival at the airport by the hotel driver and have a relaxing drive to the hotel the front desk find our reservation quickly and give us room on the same floor the lighting be a bit subdued for the room but it be compensate by the desk lamp over the writing desk and bedside table the aircon temperature could be set exactly to my preference Bathroom be a small plastic cubicle with just enough space to maneuver in for one average sized person Front desk provide complimentary shaver and toothbrush set and tea and coffee packet be replenish daily by room service my room on the 6th floor face the stadium and UBCity and be quiet the lift work well Front desk staff be helpful at all time they be friendly and answer our question about transport and even help to book a hire car for my trip to the airport and email me the receipt Breakfast be satisfactory with different type of local food and cook to make omelette and dosa Masala tea and kappi be available as be coffee and tea the fruit juice though be not juice nicely and be too lumpy Bread and cake selection be limit Check out be fast and efficient all in have a pleasant fus free stay for 4 night the place be good especially the staff be very warm and welcoming the staff member Gulshan help my mom when i be not in hotel he help in get all the supply she need with a smile on his face the good hotel in city center and budget i regularly stay in this hotel Easy to acces Complimentary breakfast high spped wifi car parking i love this hotel and recommend to use this property they give me extra time for check out i be currently stay at Ibis Bengaluru City Centre on a busines trip and my experience be definitely not the same as what other have post here First let s talk about the room the bathroom be the small i have see in any hotel in my life as you can see in the attach picture you have basin on the left WC in between and right next to that be the small shower area but this small bathroom be not my big problem as i get use to it my big problem be the lack of power point there be just 1 power point next to the bed and that mean if you want to charge your phone and the laptop at the same time it ca n t be do i ask for a multi plug or a power strip which they deny the socket i be use be one of those where you have to put the charger in a very specific position or it stop charge i be now force to charge my device one by one and i have to keep check every few min whether they be charge apart from the bathroom and the lack of charge point the room be good Second be the restaurant which be my least favorite thing about this hotel they do not deliver food to your home you have to order and then come down to take it with you but that okay minor manageable inconvenience a big inconvenience be their price and service they have one or two waiter service the entire restaurant and it extremely difficult to get a hold of them only thing you can do be wait for them to look at you Attached be the picture of a single piece of bread which cost INR 100 taxes here way more than most fine dine the reason of this exorbitant price be they want to push their buffet dinner which be n t that reasonable either at INR 900 so you have to choose between either a 100 rupee bread or a 900 rupee buffet dinner i end up take the buffet the starter be cold main course below average and no one tell me about the dessert the buffet be spread across the entire restaurant and no one tell you where thing be you have to hunt them down yourself or ask them oh and i forget to mention breakfast be not include in the room price you nee to pay INR 500 extra for that too overall not a positive experience and i regret book this place you may save some money in upfront booking cost but thing like food will make the stay way more expensive that oth hotel nearby Service be nothing to write home about Room floor and service be amazing and very fast Easy communication with the staff every time you nee any kind of service you may start your day with a workout in the gym on the top floor of the hotel thank to Pooja Gowda at FRONT OFFICE ASSOCIATE who be always there to assist you with anything although she be not from bangalore i wish to recieve good offer from IBIS to plan my next visit LoveIBISM the hotel be really good not only in term of its location but also in term of its service towards customers guy like HK Anil really take care of the guest well the hotel s bed be so cosy that it force me everyday to sleep for some more time the room be clean and have all the require faciltie the staff be very helpful and truly practice IBISM the room be cozy and pleasent stay there for around 7 day the room service be good the service agent Anil HK be very helpful now come to the food the breakfast menu be quite nice overall a good experience Trust me i like this place because of Pooja Gowda honestly if not for her i would have dread my stay i be not big fan of the food Can improve food quality and service quality you can improve keep necessity in the washroom one of the good hotel that we stay in the city of Bangalore in recent time as soon as you enter you be greet with amazing positive energy throughout right from the trendy slogan write on wall of lift to all sign board include the uniform wear by staff be all so peppy spunky and trendy a very modern feel to the entire place this place be indeed a value for money option right in the heart of the city the buffet breakfast be good the only issue we can perhaps advice the hotel improve upon be to not consider package paneer for their paneer dish Excellent service Restaurant be very good Staff be very helpful Mokinul anf Mariam be always smile and ready to help thank to them my stay be nice i look forward to mymrxt visit Lovation of hotel be great i have be use Ibis in Europe and now in India Bengaluru be

free breakfast beverage and a starter in the evening though the choice of beverage i choose a beer be very limited Breakfast be a busy affair but have all the right offering obviously will not compare to the oth 5 star property like ITC or JW Marriot which be stone through away as the price too be not comparable Excellent front desk service great breakfast buffet nice room with all the desire comfort Good value for the price each time you come back to the hotel they remember your name it not much but it make a big difference its a typical IBIS brand hotel which come with Accor standard Same size room and toilet worldwide same amenity go as a walk guest early morning at 6 30am book room with member rate Front office staff be helpful give early check in Breakfast be good enjoy complimentary beer at Bar Housekeeping need to improve as the shampoo cum bath gel set be empty which i realize in mid of shower which force me to have bath without shower gel and shampoo in the evening get it replace by call housekeeping Rest a good stay i would rate this in the top 3 or 5 Ibis hotel i have stay with and believe me i be stay in a lot of them all the staff right from the door man bell boy to guy in kitchen housekeeping front office restaurant and everyone else be do a great job if i name some that will not be do justice to other and i stay here in the past and have some

me and my wife would eat the staff at restaurant sanjay would take care of our 1 year old baby the manager also throw a cocktail party on friday evening to all people stay there for long it be a pleasant surprise one weaknes here be that you nee the acces card to take the lift which be probably necessary as a security feature however when 2 of u be stay and one person be at the reception it become a minor irritant as you have to ask the reception to aid you of course soniya would always oblige breakfast they have a decent spread with item like chicken sausage 2 item on egg one be boil egg and oth steam egg bhurji etc its the steam egg which be really tasty they have porridge bean bake almost every day which be ok on indian they serve some good vada and upma i find the chutney for

be great and way to start the day close to ub city shopping mall the restaurant be open 24 hour and have a variety of food but what stand out be Mr Dillip who make all difference i have be stay in ibi Bengaluru city centre for my official visit Hotel be centrally locate Reception staff be very helpful and food be also nice surely come back soon Thank you ibi for wonderful hospitality Keep it up though the staff be very friednyly good i be not happy at all with facility its not worth spending room be too small and hardly a person can adjut himself in the washroom Buffet menu be very limited ibi bengaluru city centre be my favourite hotel i be come to banglore every month and regular staying in this hotel because my office be near by hotel special i like restaurant staff my favourite Mr Dillip and santosh mariyam also food be excellent thank to all ibi staff i happen to stay here for 8 nights 28th Dec till 5th Jan 18 and i be repent for this decision initially thing look hunky dory when i check in but problem crop up when one of my friend come to see me in the hotel and i decide to take him to my room he be stop to come with me until he be force to show his i d proof and the bad thing be when he leave around 12ish i be make to pay for double occupancy yes they have their bizarre policy if a guest come to see u in ur room post 10 pm it will be take as double occupancy no matter even if the guest leave i have stay in many star hotel and mostly 5star one but nowhere come across such bizarre policy i have a huge argument on this with their front office manager who think that he be on a mission to protect their self create security policy and mostly to corner a solo woman traveler with moral policing he be rude n headstrong and ensure to screw up my stay there a very important piece of advice to solo woman traveller if u be plan to get ur guest in room be prepared to go through their harassment and be ready to shell out for double occupancy if it happen to be after 10 this sound like one be stay in a hostel where all these stringent rule be heavily impose anyway this be my first stay after this sickening experience with the front office manager and the hotels weird self impose policy i make up my mind not to repeat the same mistake of stay here ever there be no dearth of option definitely this hotel rule suck big time and so do the FOM this hotel room be very small and bath room be even small you ca n t even move around it be not worth the money pay the location of the hotel be very strategic though the breakfast be decent Small room good air conditioning just one hand towel bed comfortable enough friendly front desk staff large breakfast room good breakfast not the good omelette i have eat bathroom very small this be my first visit in Bangalore we be regular staying in Mumbai but this time we choose here and we feel like home and we enjoy New year party in this hotel also food Excellent and service very nice special thank to Dillip and Srijant and mariyam it be indeed difficult to find a hotel that be clean neat and comfortable and that have wifi IBIS have all you require our Stay be pleasant and Team IBIS make it memorable Breakfast be good and be a must have highly recommend IBIS as it have all one need in the evening i meet Dilip at the hub and ask him to make mock tail which be not on menu he ask preference and make a drink which match to my wish Great would recommend him and ask for some more hidden surprise drink this be the 2nd time i m stay in Ibis First time be on busines trip and this one family trip we choose Ibis for the location as we want to be as near as possible to our venue so that not to get strike in B lore traffic Room Room be clean and crisply do bed be good enough for a family of 3 the space around be a bit congested bco of luggage for a family if you be alone this wo nt be a problem at all the towel be show the age which can be improve one night there be an issue of smoke alarm get trigger in one of the room bco of vapour from the shower later i also note the exhaust in the bath be not work properly and hence there be too much of vapour rise in Bathroom after each bath this should be take care Restaurant Bar Breakfast spread be good Good option on all the cuisine and make to order dish Staff be helpful and courteous Overall be a good experience surely will recommend this one staff be so helpful especially i see all the time Dilip and Naveez keep up the time for any work assign to them and they be friendly make us comfortable overall great experience love the hospitality have a comfortable stay perfect air conditioning good breakfast good view and a complimentary beverage coupon unlike my experience at Delhi and Jaipur Special thank and recognition to Mr Syed Mr Rohit and Ms Piyanka for the warm reception accord feel pampered i have be to Bangalore several time and this be the first time i enjoy my stay the ibi hotel Bangalore city centre have give me an excellent experience equivalent to the one i have enjoy in some of the hotel in my European trip the room be clean and well equipped staff be polite and always ready to help and the food at the restaurant be of great quality especially the breakfast be fantastic hence for all who be plan a visit to Bangalore Ibis city centre be a good option for your stay everything excellent peple very nice good food good location the restaurant on the GR floor be great all the restaurant staff be really nice next time if come here will choose this hotel again if you do businee in this city good choice excelent service by DILLIP SANTOSH good Location good value for money Good staff and helpful Quite place and comfort Good for family as i could see some of them i will visit with my family again to this hotel i wish all the good to them i be there for two week in first half of October i have choose it simply because Name IBIS carry but the stay be n t very pleasant the plu be good view i get a room overlook kanteevara stadium and it very close to cubbon park the room be very small Bathroom very cramped for the price whoever have to pay from pocket its certainly be n t the place they do goof up with laundry bill which be modify after multiple follow up but they want to adjust it against something else which i be n t keen on Poorest thing be service i never ever get even water at breakfast without my asking and menu be too repetitive Food be ultra expensive for no such quality they have some thali cost 450 buck which be just ok but absolute no value for money and in that as well on few occasion i have to tell the person take order what to serve Bangalore be a nice place and you can certainly have meal outside but when i be there it be pour down heavily hence i be dependent on that meal there be restaurant in the vicinity of km which you should explore rather have any meal here Inspite tell them not to knock on weekend early morning for newspaper they do ensure i do n t get good sleep this be tell and reiterate Small thing but matter a lot in hospitality industry Tv volume be low for many day until they do adjust it after tell Internet speed be fine no complaint there there be less to no plug point in case you want to use good night etc Replenishments like water be n t keep on few occasion without inform no Fan AC do n t have remote Billing be request a day earlier and manage well but all and all complete avoidable and if you still end up here a strict no for food and long stay if you be a family will hardly have place to move after keep luggage and service be way way below par i have get this book for my colleague as she have some busines in the city the booking cost be INR 5500 avg price for a good 3 star in bangalore with all amenity although the location be good the room be pathetic the bathroom look like a well version of aircraft s bathroom the seat of the toilet be v small there no mini bar just a old fridge the coffee and tea sachet provide look as if the person be in a cheap lodge the buffet breakfast be average the egg omelette have so small piece of of onion tomato etc in my life i have never see such minutely cut vegetable the tea serve be 1 4th cup in a very small glas there be be no almost walnut only raisin the gym be so compact while use treadmill u feel the roof be hardly few inch away from your head i wonder a 6 foot plus person cannt even use the treadmill quite odd pls note there be no SPA no POOL just a CONGESTED GYM with no attendant no water bottle no toilet BASICALLY they have do cost cutting every possible way they can i would suggest take any oth hotel room at this cost and eat and stay properly Ibis Bangalore Located Centre of City fast check in Room too compact but clean Near Room Bathroom small but clean Breakfast too good with variety over all Its Purly for Business People the hotel be situate in the heart of the city centre The staff be very cooperative and our overall stay be just excellent its a value for money hotel with all basic amenity in place for comfort i come to attend the meditation clas here and i be clear in my mind that i will eat very less during lunch break but when i finally come down for lunch the food be so good and the service be so great i end up eat good amount of food Anand and Vishwa thank you for your hospitality i would probably be a regular visitor now on Govind

coupon as well which come in handy the service staff be pretty prompt and courteous have a very pleasant check in and check out experience Room itself be pretty comfortable for a busines traveler i would say that the room be well equip for a single person if two of you be travel it may be a little bit cramped up unless you take a twin bed room i be a 7th floor will nice view of Kanteerava stadium the free wi fi be a must these day anyway the food breakfast and dinner be lavish and nice variety the only uncomfortable thing be it be literally spread out and i have to make 2 3 round just to ensure i at least see what all be there in the menu during dinner time the rotie do take a bit of time to be serve and in Breakfast it be pretty crowded thus there be a momentary shortage of cutlery but overall a very good and comfortable experience the front desk have even call me within 15 min of check in just to confirm that all be well with the room Must stay if you be on a busines trip Santosh and Dilip have be excellent in their service very warm and quick much desire in this industry Wish them good luck Regrds Anil Singhal President Spectrum Group member of Accor hotel since

busines visit Check in be handle efficiently however i be assign a smoking room when i specifically ask for a non smoking room i go back to the front desk and be reassign a non smoking room the bathroom be a plastic enclosure which be really cramped and no toiletry apart from a bar of soap and liquid shampoo soap in a fix dispenser in the shower for the price i pay for the room i could get a much well hotel in Bengaluru i forget a pair of clothe in the closet when i check out and remember when i arrive back home i call the hotel to ask whether they find the clothe and they say they would get back to me no one ever call back on the plus side breakfast be good and there be a huge spread of food i stay at this hotel for two day in March 2017 the hotel be centrally locate with easy acces to place of busines or entertainment since i be on a busines visit this mean i do not have to waste too much time in travel Traffic in Bangalore can be a nightmare so this mean i could put my time to constructive use the room here be impeccably clean and the service be friendly i reach the hotel a couple of hour before the regular check in time but the front office person Rohit be extremely helpful and immediately arrange a room of my choice the dinner buffet be quite elaborate and enjoyable overall this be a good value for money hotel in a place like Bangalore on the flip side there be very little space in the lobby and if you have to wait for someone you be well of wait in your room this hotel be definitely one you can come to and expect to be take complete care of start from the wonderful reception where people actually make you issue their issue and try to solve it even if it not in the scope of job It an absolutely delightful stay with staff who actually live up to the concept of personalized care the duty manager Ms Subarna Sarkar deserve a special mention also a special mention of the head chef Mr Rajan and the smooth operation in the restaurant with a mention of Mr Zafar the ever smile and helpful person ensure an amazing dining experience Clean room and peace of mind with amazing food that ibi city center bangalore highly recommend i be very impressed with the responsivenes of the staff the duty manager Subarna Sarkar be a top down example of a service drive organization whose aim be to delight their customer although i do n t stay at the hotel i be glad our training event be hold there and the food be great Staye here for 11 night on a busines trip Great value for money staff F B be fantastic no cool that Accor do not credit you with loyalty

experience here dash my belief while the room be okay i be put off by the kitchen plate be dirty every time and rhe staff do not seem to care T when i bring it to their notice they say that 1 in so many plate will be dirty now this be unacceptable Location be okay not too great so all in all avoid go here the location be the good of it come to work in a city like Bengaluru u really nee to cut your travel time and this place offer it Food quality be perfect and really enjoy the buffet this property for accor surely be one of the good for me in Bengaluru if u travel for work Accor need to

the staff always happy smiley face with staff always ready to help reception team hardworking efficient room attendant small but clean room food have meet my expectation would love to visit again Kudos team keep work the Way you be there be a promise of 15 min service or on their account the staff have apparently take this in the wrong meaning 1 the check in here be one of the slow i have experience 15 minute so unfriendly check in 2 the wifi code be not work the front desk be not take the phone after five ring 15 min they come 3 fortunately wi fi start with the brew code but the slow wifi speed one can get any where 4 the hand wash in the toilet be leak 5 the service in the resturant be absolutely third rate 6 garbage be not remove from the bin in the room but the positive be cleanliness because of the newnes of the hotel cubbon park view stay on a recent trip to Bangalore for a night for a budget hotel IBIS be definitely expensive room be way too tiny and the bathroom be dirty and stinky Check in and check out take over an hour Breakfast be awesome Good hotel Small room small bathroom very central near MG road Good food friendly staff Price stay be good Diner all type Breakfast also Great cappuccino in the restaurant we enjoy Taxi to airport available have be to this hotel on a recce and the property look quite new as it well maintain only one category of room which be opt for a busines traveler be at the prime location be a main attraction to this property and it have gym conference room which can take around 50 60 people in a theatre style and rooftop restaurant in the evening the buffet spread be good and have an attach bar to it the advantage for the guest here be if they tend to check out early in the morning still they have something to grab which start from 4 AM also for late riser if the full buffet breakfast be miss out the quick byte be available till afternoon to begin with from the location its locate straight in the heart of the city very close to all the place where we can go the building be very huge and the staff everyone from the checkin at the reception to the staff at the kitchen be very welcoming the size of the room be very small and bathroom be too small its like you be enter to some play field it end where it start this could have be well the restaurant the breakfast be too good a very large spread be there to choose from and obviously the price be a bit on high side but its good compare the service this be the second Ibis hotel i be stay and must compliment Ibis city centre for the amazing hospitality the room be small and so be the bathroom however ou would not expect much of the Ibis brand for the price they offer however theit hospitality right from the restaurant to the HK on floor in commendable always have a smile and willing to go out their way to ensure we stay here for the first time in January and find this hotel more than welcome staff all of them have great attitude room be good and amenity and facility be good thing include wifi work well though wifi be patchy in between although we be not happy with the breakfast or rather some part of it be in bamgalore we expect well taste for sambhar and chutney and ofcourse also for the idly but somehow we be disappointed this be not the sambhar and idly and chtneys one expect in the capital of Karnataka but else everything be fine guy cheer u do a good job this be the perfect place for a busines trip as the hotel be conveniently locate and very comfortable the room be neat and clean and you can really get a good night rest to keep you fresh for the next working day my stay here be good the location be very accessible and the staff very hospitable please do something about your bathroom size as it be very small for a big size person like me the bar be nice and the staff very smiley i make a booking for this Hotel through a well know on line Travel Company who send me a voucher for the booking two day prior to the travel i get a Text Msg about the cancellation of a booking which be abort so i call up the Travel Company which reconfirm the booking yet when i arrive at the Hotel i be tell that the travel company have cancel the booking i show them the conformation and make the hotel and book company talk to each oth fortunately one Mr Kedar step in be resole the booking issue and allot the room i be really flustered on this avoidable mes between the two party this put me off badly the add on to this i want to get my room floor clean up of the food spillage i call up the Guest Services and House keep four time each between 11 00 to 11 30hrs on 15 02 2017 and no one bother to pick up the phone once again i report this to Mr Kedar who have promise to look into the lapse i wonder how ACCOR tolerate the inconvenience to the guest while we be there we have step out for awhile and before we could get back some violence have start around that area as a bundh be enforce and hence we be not able to get back to the hotel but the staff be really wonderful and after we explain our issue offer to send a car for us it feel wonderful thank ibis d i like the the location of the hotel Good scenery of the city can be view from the top the hospitality of all the staff be good among all i love the hospitality of Mr Sourav Mondal he be a hard work dedicated employee his gesture cooperation and the hospitality be excellent another employee i find best be Mr Rohit for his good and Frank communication with the visitor this be not the first Ibis i have stay at and must say it be definitely what it be across the globe so do n t expect anything different Everything from Room Size contain bathroom Liquid Soap and Small Window the bed and linen be very good and the room be well maintain the service at the property be very good right from the reception to the restaurant i must specially mention the food at the hotel be excellent i have the buffet for INR700 and simply love the food lot of option in the buffet and fruit and Dessert the breakfast again be good with lot of option Will definitely recommend this hotel first i like the location which be near by greenery Cuban Park and another thing i like the very nice city view from hotel room during my 3 week stay in IBIS hotel i meet different staff all of them be very nice from floor in charge to the person sit in the reception but i find excellent hospitality service by Mr Sourav Mondal and Mr Rohit during our breakfast and dinner time i have find Mr Sourav to be very active and provide excellent service everyday he be work so hard and give 100 to each and every guest excellent person that i have ever meet his way of communication be also very nice find lot of respect to guest from his side IBIS Hostel be really lucky to get such type of staff and equally we be and talk about Mr Rohit he be also very nice person that we meet in IBIS hotel communication be also very nice indeed excellent person and one more thing i should n t mis security system be very nice we do n t have to worry Thanks Bikash Shrestha Room No Check in 217 and and 411 Jan 15 to Feb 4 Excellent hospitality service by the staff of the hotel especially Mr Rohit and Mr Rakshat Value for money Wonderful location Buffet breakfast can be improve stay for 12nights i have very limited choice during breakfast Good standard IBIS Hotel locate in the heart of the city Everything be in close proximity Good efficient and friendly security and the staff be always helpful and smiley we definitely recommend it i stay here last week till 2nd Feb and find the room clean and the bed comfortable the breakfast be Indian however they do omelette on request ca n t comment on roof top bar as it be shut but the bar downstairs be pricey drink be all can and bottle no draught beer however i find that majority of autorickshaws driver do n t know this hotel so i have problem return back to hotel in the evening on checkout i have early morning flight i ask the receptionist to call me a taxi and they refuse say that i have to use there shuttle service cost me 2 650 rupee in tax as i do n t Know this city i have no choice my ADVICE to FELLOW traveller be to MAKE SURE you BOOK a TAXI beforehand or USE ub otherwise your GET sting if i ever return i try a hotel nearer to M g road this be a budget hotel with pricing at premium end possibly because of its location otherwise like any oth Ibis hotel smallish room decently do up clean and functionally efficient Do not expect any additional charm some may consider it as cold service but gues Ibis do not promise otherwise on the negative side Service not as good as i be expect the TV in my room be not work one day Inspite of call up housekeeping reception no one come to check on the positive the hotel service can be say to be reliable you get largely what be promise the food at the restaurant be good Overall you get what be largely expect of Ibis though i would have some issue with the pricing Would have appreciate a morning newspaper Food be pathetic they do n t have a basic first Aid Kit with them and neither an antacid no toiletry either inspite of charge as much as oth 4 star room be good Staff be very courteous Cleanliness be upto the mark location be central to acces all the happen place around very good compact and cozy room nicely finish and maintain highly recommend for everyone locate strategically Breakfast menu be excellent and swimming pool be also very good stay here for two night and really enjoy Rehemat do the very excellent Support service Dilip Rajan Sanjay Vikas sagar all be very supportive in service while dinner Rohit Tez Subarna be very supportive and excellent service in my long stay more than four month Ibis as usual be pretty good hotel with a value for money the location of the hotel be in city centre though taxi people find it difficult to recall the room be nice though a little bit small in size the place be good and recommend for busines traveler for short duration the breakfast menu be limit and can be increase the good part of the hotel be that it be very conveniently locate in the city center the hotel be very nicely do up and staff be very helpful the decor of the hotel meet the Ibis style of do up i see the same decor on a very recent trip to Goa the room be also good they have a nice restaurant and it serve all meal as buffet the food be good too they have a nice bar although a small one all in all a nice and comfortable busines trip stay here for a short busines trip the hotel be good for the price it offer the room specially the bathroom be small but clean and well maintain the breakfast buffet be excellent and have a good variety the staff be very courteous the check in check out be smooth overall a good value for money the only downside be that the hotel should provide basic toiletry like shampoo and conditioner the only thing that it provide be a soap and a body wash the body wash have a weird smell the hotel aim at provide a decent room and a decent breakfast at a budget and it do full justice basically you get how much you pay so if you be look for a 5 star facility then this may not be the right hotel for you for that you may shell out more money and book ITC that be across the road me and my wife stay in this hotel for 10 day and the one word come to my mind be awesome to summarise my stay there the hotel service be very nice the staff be very friendly the buffet breakfast be too good we d book 5 room and be on a busines trip i ve rate this hotel only for the room advise you should not expect anything else from this hotel the price that you pay for this be exorbitant you will get a similar room with much well service for similar rate i ll explain my reason for this point wise 1 we check in late at the hotel and go to freshen up all we could find in the bathroom as toiletry be a soap i e Shampoo Conditioner Moisturizer Dental Shaving kit be not provide we inquire with the staff to get an answer that the same be provide on guest request be chargeable 2 on argue they reason that since they provide room at less rate to some people they do not keep these as default in all room only provide to guest who ve book full rate we d book full rate but they have to ask could n t they themselves check booking do this on their own 3 after half an hour wait two more call later the house keep guy deliver with a bill to sign for the charge which i deny to sign 4 i d a look at the body wash canister as make me curious for its unusual shape happen to see the date photo attach its expiry date have go almost a year back so it be well to use a soap i doubt any unsuspecting guest would ve check 5 they provide with 2 bottle of moisturizer no conditioner such careless attitude 6 Nothing in the bar if you feel hungry breakfast quality too be n t upto the mark stay with 3 room for 1 week great staff thankyou to the staff at reception Thankyou to all resturant stafff and security and house keep as good as any Ibis Staff all try the little extra i will recomend to any Australians come over it be a budget hotel which would be very clear once you be in the room the washroom appear to be a pre engineered structure fit into the room first time that i see such a structure it appear expensive for its category though i may have book on a very busy day in Bangalore i have almost spend 8 month at a stretch at this hotel as iam here in Blore on an assignment the entire team be very helpful and courteous and have be steadfast in attend to the requirement Feedback be take often from the customer for continuous improvement Special thank to the Chef and his entire team Rehmat from housekeeping team Kedar and his entire team and all the boy there in the Spice restaurant highly recommend for stay room be tiny but still comfortable there be no shaving kit in the room which be much disappointing breakfast buffet be good but there be no brown sugar no tea spoon in the restaurant Staff be well behaved i spend a day with my friend for Lunch Excellent service provide by the Entire management Specially Chef Sathish explain the Food variety and communicate patiently for all our quest all staff be Excellent in treat their customer be much Appreciated have a party here host several out station guest for 2 3 day all arrangement be very well manage from efficient check in to breakfast room service and dinner banquet a heartfelt thank to the team lead by Mr Srinivas highly recommend for stay and for banquet Service be unfailingly smile which would have make up for any minor defects though there be none anyway Location Exact city centre next to Mallya Hospital ITC Gardenia UB City etc room like all ibi same to same good for 1night short stay Service check in staff room service staff be extremely helpful and enthusiastic eag to serve help Pricing affordable i have start look at Accor hotel seriously after i try their hotel in the UK Indonesia on my recent trip to bengaluru i decide to stay here to see for myself if they maintain the same high standard for India too i be happy to say the hotel be super efficient everything very good except for a minor hiccup on timely room cleaning service however the moment i point it out the room be clean within minute a good sized room for a single person with nice view of the stadium varied breakfast to die for fish tikka all in all i strongly recommend this hotel i have stay at this place earlier in Oct 2015 my recent stay be on the New Year eve i find there be much improvement Check in out be very smooth this time i find staff at front office restaurant be hospitable and friendly but i do n t find any supervisory executives manager inquire at least at randomly with customer Food be delicious and have variety Mr Firoz JANGARIA the Hotel Manager have assure me that they would take appropriate measure to addres the issue when i bring to his notice during my early visit now i compliment Mr Firoz and his team for overall improvement the House Keeping staff have do good job i suggest that the restaurant need more waiter and supervision to inquire about the customer s requirement when you think of ibi you can have some mixed feeling on comfort functionality restaurant etc i be a little concerned with what i maybe get myself into especially consider the very reasonable price ok its not a 5 star gold plate Taj hotel the room be modest but comfortable the internet work very well and the hotel have a basic but complete fitnes room the bathroom be a general drop in molded unit but the shower work very well the restaurant be quite spacious and simple but the food preparation choice and quality be excellent even a standard cup of coffee be great i really enjoy eat here and it be everyday for 4 day straight the Bar be simple i ca nt really add anymore ultimately this hotel provide a much high level than the cost would indicate if you be look for 5 star opulence then you can go across the road to the ITC Gardenia and pay 3 time the price which may be fine but for a modest value this hotel be a competent busines hotel we be satisfied with the hotel however room be too small and the picture be misleading it get too cramped in the room as well as the washroom to optimize space the entire room seem to be design in a space pod esque fashion the stay be not value for money this time i would only give 4 star out of 5 because the bed sheet do not look clean there be also some hole on it they certainly should addres this to stay on top as usual all the very good Room be neat and clean the staff try their good to make our stay comfortable Quick room service budget stay and moreover walkable distance to metro station the only complain be that if you be a traveller with heavy luggage reach the place from the metro bu railway station would be difficult as no transport can reach the place due to the road digging and construction work go on lastly one plus point be the hotel allow 24 hour check in the hotel be locate where no auto or taxi from the railway station will take you the hotel staff be not friendly Wish i have positive thing to share about my experience no in hotel cafeteria or restaurant to boot i have one day a night stay in this hotel i have to procee further for my long journey from Bengaluru so i choose this the hotel be good and close to Railway Station the staff be polite i would recommend for short stay Overall good experience Room be good but no restaurant road be digge not able to reach the hotel Near by no good hotel to take food its walk able distance to City junction Bachelor stay its good and costly Four Bed room no ventilation the room be well than what i have expect they be really clean and they have fresh utility they service be really good and helpful the restaurant be renovate so ca n t tell about the food but i m sure it ll be good Would denitely visit again stay quite a few time while book directly it be 24 hour check out 24 hour from check in this time they say it be 12 noon to 12 noon 24 hour Crazy definition now all the approach road be dig out for some municipality work no vehicle can reach the place or travel raw road round about for three four km walk way be dust fill if you have heavy luggage not recommend till the road be back to normal may be another six month otherwise it be a good place to stay though no restaurant room service be quick and good be a good stay Metro railway station and bu stop all within walking distance there be room service and a restaurant down enjoy the stay Staff also helpful Will stay again when visit Bangalore Unproffesional staff non co operative at any circumstance always try to charge extra give exuse Even after say many time room service and cleaning not do Food item be all same in taste and many time they say not available you can get good food at walkable distance from the hotel Signature inn be a very nice hotel which consist of many facility eventhough its near the road less noisy inside the hotel also management and cleanlines maintain well also its near the bu terminal and train station thereby i recommend this hotel for a family stay the hotel be totally trash they give me room it have bud bug no hot water no water in commode when complain they say no water in tank it be nightmare i make a mistake by book this hotel it be cheap third clas hotel do nt go with family one of the good place to stay in Bengaluru the Hotel be only a 10 minute walk from railway station Room and surrounding

good but room be smell very bad full of cigarette smell include bathroom which we have not think of those kind of smell in room which i do nt like as they say hot and cold running water i do nt find hot running water in my stay rest everything be ok Hotel be nice have good location center of city staff be helpful and co operative the experience be really good we Enjoy Lot Food also have good n rate also low as compare to oth hotel Hotel be maintain clean the attitude of the reception people will be very different depend upon whether you book through their website or through oth app like goibibo in my case i can surely say this because within a space of 15 day i book through both the above mode and experience the clear discrimination it start right from the smoothnes of check in proces issue of newspaper at the doorstep not do the room clean even if request to do when book through goibibo despite get mail from goibibo state that no need to call and confirm with the hotel when i contact the reception just to check with the confirmation of booking initially be tell that there be no booking in my name and ask me to send the mail from goibibo after send that too be inform that there be no msg from goibibo to them later when i raise my voice and argue he tell me to contact with the goibibo after half an hour of repeat call only atleast able to check in Worst experience their profit margin may be low when not do through their website but that be a busines decision if they do n t want customer from goibibo they should delist it and take booking only from their site no point in get list and poorly treat like this otherwise the property be a decent one in that area hope their management shall look into this Excellent service and facility very easy accessible from majestic town Awesome restaurant near by Good for family visit also it be the center hub which be easy accessible to Metro station railway station and oth tourist destination Safe stay for family without any fear in heart of city with everything you nee in reach the staff courteous clean good food comfortable worth every penny strongly recommend for budget stay only set back be most room do n t have ceiling fans we stay in AC no issue i get this hotel it be the Majestic area and convenient for transit purpose it be also pretty cheap but i wrongly expect it to be reasonable the hotel be unclean and not well maintain it be situate in a very congested area Professional staff and good service have to followup pre booking otherwise they allot room for some one any how good service and professional staff to recognise location be little bit difficult for new visitor i recommend this to my friend we stay 4 ppl friend and the service be good the room be clean and tidy the restaurant attach to it have variety of food and it serve tasty food its a must book hotel if u stay near majestic Good hotel for temporary stay they follow a 24 hour check in check out policy which be more convenient i check in Deluxe Double AC room for a single room which charge me Rs 1210 with all taxis well connected with Majestic metro railway station and bu stand Taxi and Auto can be find everywhere Good restroom with hot and cold water facility you can order food via Intercom inside room itself Food facility start from morning 7 30 WiFi at the speed of 512kbps overall a good experience Value for money near railway station good room and polite staff 24 hr check in and check out please book directly thru hotel website clean room and toilet for food there be nearby hotels comfort i have bitt experience a couple of time in the past with unflexible checkin checkout time of 12 pm to 12 pm when reach Bangalore early morning after a night s journey from Kerala or Hyderavad by bu i have to take a room for the 5 or 6 hour remain for the actual Checkin well the Signature Inn solve this problem with a 24 hour checkin policy i check in at 6 30 am on 28 feb 18 and check out

through MMT for single occupancy non Ac room be book for Net Rs 666 the room provide be extremely small picture be attach for your perusal Mattress be a little hard as compare to my liking the property be locate in the busy market very close to Bangalore central train station Hotel have an in house restaurant but they do n t serve breakfast after 11 be so have to opt for breakfast nearby in a north Indian Punjabi restaurant recommend only if available on similar price that too for a short stay Signature Inn be a very nice place to stay if you be look for a good hotel at a cheap price the staff member be very helpful and the room be very clean and hygienic we stay there for three day and i must say our stay be very comfortable i would recommend this hotel to my friend and relative it

bathroom water heater be not work properly and smoking smell be roam around inside the bathroom the stay be very comfortable the boy be polite if i visit Bangalore again visit i will stay there only they clean the room every day it be very close to the railway station and majestic my overall view be very good the Signature Inn be a very cheap hotel with excellent service and cozy room We total 4

Hotel be within walkable distance not very close from Bangalore city Junction get a single room in 4th floor have a pleasant stay the stuff be also good but expect a well welcome during check in although in their website in Check in Check out Policy they mention about flexibility of a 24 hour check in check out the check out time be before 12 pm as they ask me during check in anyway i check out early in the morning the Restaurant Raagam be ok but not that good option for veg 100 perfect to stay here good service location be nearby to Bus stand and Railway station room be neat and clean well maintain Staff be very good in behavior though the room be slightly small it be money worth the restaurant offer tasty food Hotel signature Inn bangalore this be a budget hotel and the locality of the hotel be good enough as it near metro and bu stand and also walkable distance from railway 10 minute walk from railway The room be small but be clean and well maintain the Check in time be 12

the room be very neat and clean bathroom be also very good all oth service be also good only the roadside bar and surround be nasty but still that do not affect our stay the staff be also very polite and helpful so for the money my stay be relatively pleasant it be near to the metro station so can easily hop to oth part of the city MG Road two complaint firstly the room do constantly smell of solvent no idea why never work it out open all window over night solve nothing probably get too high overnight to care by morning secondly we have a late train 10 pm so they kindly look after our luggage for the day i get it back at least so i should be greatful however it come back cover in dust on the one side ok i gues but on the oth be a really honk smell come from a sticky goo later discover large bug leg in the goo which be hard to remove half a packet of baby wipe to even slightly tackle the problem still smell this bag later become my pillow on the follow night s sleeper train so that be fun Anyway the place be alright but one star in the count of after two year of travel i manage to keep my backpack relatively clean 5 hour with these guy and they cover it in putrid bile Bell boy just watch and smirk as i clean which do n t help this hotel be in a location close to the railway and bu station and be locate in a congested area the hotel be generally clean but little roach be there pest control could have be use we have stay in a different hotel in the same area a few year ago all say this hotel have a budget which be affordable and ok for a short stay of a few day and close to all transportation like bu train and metro besides cab service i stay for 2 day and it be value for money Pro s 1 very much near to Railway station kempagowda metro and majestic main bu stand 2 Food be tasty 3 Room service be good front desk be very helpful Con s 1 two Bar s be locate on the opposite side feel unsafe all the time 2 Food in restaurant be bit costly 3 no auto cab will take you from station to this hotel since its locate in a short distance 1 2 km you have to do the walking management must do something for this 4 Hot water availability for bathing be not available for a long time must finish off the bathing before 8am 5 whenever we come back to the room it feel Smoky do n t know why 6 Lot of bug very neat clean value for money good room service need to customise the package include complimentary bf dinner as per customer requirement within jurisdiction Rest all be good in good proximity with metro bu stand rly stn cleanlines be awesome with superb food i be happy with the staff and service room be very neat and clean Near to railway station as well as the staff be very supportive and very humble nature i would like to thank to all they treat well and serve nicely this be the good budget hotel in Majestic area Prime location close to railway bu station close to shop whole sale market breakfast not include room neat but small no room service and no changing of linen Negative point we have order chicken in the restaurant for 2 day both the day there be foul smell and stale taste me n my family health spoil after that Nice hotel near 10 min walking KSR bangalore station Neat and clean but not expensive as it be close to railway station hire Uber and Ola be difficult but auto be available the reception be laway open and one good thing be there be open check in and check out time i stay here twice in September the first time i arrive very late and it be good that the reception be still open the room be good and i be quite happy with the service the second time however i find bed bug in my room and request to shift i be give a much well and clean room and be very happy with the experience the restaurant be n t amazing but be quite good for the price and location very near Majestic this be very much worth it near the busstation i discover this pleasant hotel not too expensive with everything you nee a neat and comfortable room with a prop bed bathroom and WiFi the staff be very friendly and i enjoy spend time in the coffeeshop Nice hotel with budget amount neat and tidy good service overall good parking facility and good veg restaurant nearby but the area where hotel be not clean and very busy suggest for one or two day traveler i have be stay here since last many year and it have always be a pleasant stay Nice Hotel Prompt Polite and helpful Staff clean Room and Bathroom Excellent Location Everything very Good specially this time when i visit there they have add a new facility at reception i e Chilled Water Station with fruit fusion Everyday a new fruit flavor water Nice Hotel with Prompt Polite and helpful Staff clean Room and Bathroom though our stay be very short enjoy the stay Location be good though in a slightly congested part of Town highly recommendable for stay with family or alone stay at Signature Inn through a search through Booking com which give the good rate as i want to be near the Bangalore City Railway station i book an air condition room for two night through booking com but have to come one day earlier hence book a non ac room through the hotel website the non ac room be on the same floor as the reception and be just average with a musty smell i be happy to check into the AC room for the next two day and it be on the second floor however what i find lack in their hospitality be the reception say that breakfast be not complimentary since my room reservation be through booking com in the same breath the receptionist say that if i have book through Make my trip com or Goibibo com the breakfast would have be complimentary if you request the Manager of the hotel also he will give the same reply in a more pompous manner you realize you have to give these man that look of awe at the important decision that they take otherwise the reception staff Lokesh and Shaikh be very helpful nice will guide your taxi or auto to the hotel wherever you be come from so in case you nee a complimentary breakfast you know what to do but probably the rate will be high to cover the cost of breakfast i do not really bother to check as the room rate as well as restaurant rate be reasonable with room be under r 1500 per night the AC room be quite nice and even have a small tv in the room plus a good toilet kit the AC in the room be not very effective but sufficient as Bangalore weather be quite cool on the day i stay but believe it unbearably hot on some day the water have to be leave run for some time to get hot water in the pipe in the bath but otherwise quite a standard bath room functional neat toilet the restaurant on the ground floor serve good food at quite reasonable cost and hence it really do n t matter if the breakfast be not complimentary so go for book the room through booking com itself at least you do not have to pay in advance can cancel the booking with a 48 hour notice if require so far so good on the room and stay but step out on to the road outside the hotel be another matter as it be one hell of a busy stretch and you will nee to be careful to not trip over stone on the badly lay footpath with drain and open urinal on the side of the road lead to the main road especially if you take a walk during the evening i would not advice a stay here if you be come with family but for a backpacker or a solo traveler on a low budget it could be the place to go if you do not mind the deathtrap of a road out side as you could get hit by scooterist or autorickshaw who will whiz by at great speed as if they do n t see you walk on the road Do not take the autorickshaw just outside the hotel as they will rip you off on the charge as they do not go by the meter but walk to the main road to hail a pass auto or book an Uber taxi but never an Ola cab the railway station bu station be just within walk distance if you do not have any luggage on the whole a nice budget accommodation to stay if you be look for a budget place to stay near the railway station but do not mind the congested death trap of a road just outside the hotel Good Hotel the Reception staff be very courteous Clean an neat room good restaurant with decent spread buffet one of the close hotel near Narayana Health City Service be really fast as compare to oth hotel nearby i be so glad i find this hotel it be in the centre of Majestic close by to train bus restaurant have fly in from Australia i be glad to find a clean quiet spot with such friendly staff the wifi be great Tv with movie in the room Toothbrush and toothpaste on arrival too so great Lovely manager Vinod Kumar also staff Manoranjan and Shaik be so smiley and polite i ll be back Budget Hotel AC Non AC both type of room available Hotel s restaurant be not so good Complimentary breakfast be very limited Hotel staff be co operative Good option for single stay and family stay as well i be happy with the stay and restaurant but location be not as expect only 5 minute walk to the railway station i be happy with the service and food the Restaurant attach be provide very tasty food i like the room i be stay the amenity be also good the room be AC with good bathroom and this be mostly a self service hotel i expect nothing less from Bangalore the room be clean and so be the bathroom with hot water provision Only thing miss be a ceiling fan where we have a wall fan there be no mineral water instead filter water in a jug Place be 20 min away from city centre and cost around 130 r to get to Brigade road Suggest book an Uber instead and insist on them switch on the AC this be bang near the main city and quiet cheap there be many shop nearby for shopping and food only be careful of the traffic to get in as the lane be very small and you nee patience of at least 10 15 min to get in from main city centre close to railway station the management and restaurant be extremely courteous and professional Can easily get Uber Ola for your travel and its about 1 30 hr to airport room be clean in good condition Staff be polite service be good if you book the room from their website you get 24 hour check out time you can check in at any time even if it be at midnight they welcome you with a big smile Location be good walkable distance from bu stand railway station and metro station Room price too be good highly recommend the location be owesome just walkable distance approx 700 meter from Bengaluru railway station as well as bu station room be new clean staff be polite courteous Wifi speed be good overall budget hotel truly value for money Basic hotel infrastructure be there with complimentary south indian breakfast at very afffordable rate enjoy 1night stay before we go to Airport Good staff and responsive but small room and it in a congested lane OTC road but walkable distance from Majestic bu depot near to many attractive garden of Bangalore very nice place to stay in the heart of city Hospitality service off course food be very well well connected with Metro Bus stand even cab well equipped with AC and even Television and oth facility i have stay two time within a week during my checked in first time the receptionist give me long form to fill up when i refuse to do that he smile and deal this issue cordially to be fill up by himself however when i check again in second time after two day there be another receptionist and he force me to do so this be very disappointing there be tissue and not even tissue holder in the bathroom the window glass be hardly lock i have find some oth hotel nearby this place with low quotation May be these hotel be not available for online booking after read so many review finally choose this the signature inn it worth neat and clean locate near metro bu stand they deliver food to our room with some extra service charge i will recommend this hotel to my friend and family i have be stay for year here this hotel be a very good budget hotel and i can assure you that this be the good in this price category in such a crowded part of the city the majestic a ten minute walk from the Kempagowda bu station or City main railway station they do nt offer commission to Autoricksaw or anyone so the auto guy will seldom recommend this property to you so just ask the auto guy signature inn near cottonpet dargah mosque Staff be kind and to the point the restaurant below serve very good south indian meal a bit cold though but its ok it have never bother my tummy until now i can recommend Signature inn whoever be look for low budget and good stay our group of friend check in early morning to this hotel but hotel management cooperate its budget hotel covinient location walk distance from railway station room be clean good service wifi be available this hotel be modern the bedroom be every clean and the bathroom be to a European standard we check in at 07 00 after the night train and arrange to check at 10 00am today however we receive a call at 07 15 this morning to say please check out now as you have not pay not a very good reception service from staff WiFi very poor i make my booking through MMT and i get a awesome deal i have make booking for 3 night the room which be give be nice spacious and also cozy i love cozy rooom the only disadvantage of hotel be it be locate bit inside but that be fine we can adjust if the room quality be nice the breakfast we do n t have much option Dosa idli but the food be good overall nice place for amount which i get hotel it a very good hotel to stay in the Bangalore Thing that i most like about this hotel be the parking facility you can park your vehicle if you be travel by car and you can roam around the city with Metro near Metro station be just 2 km away despite this i give 4 star because when i check in in the room i see that the room be infest with bedbug but when i tell about this to the management they happily replace the room also the hotel have free wifi availability all n all the place good except the traffic congestion since it be locate in the city center i d advice that one must travel by public transport preferably Metro Visit this resort on transit through Bangalore airport as it be economically price for clean room and food i like sport so can enjoy a swim too before leave for the airport Resort help with airport taxi service too when request over email Many colleague from my company also frequently stay at this resort during transit at Bangalore airport have our doctor college reunion for 3 day here meet all friend after 25 year the staff extremely helpful with all our request for the group our family and child too enjoy the sport facility and food since we be a large group almost 85 person with family on some occasion we have exclusive acces to all the game special bonfire seat in lawn and we have a wonderful time Green clean budget stay and good advantage very close to airport for friend or family come from all over India if i could give negative rating we want for a staycation at this place

cottage and ask for an extra bed and what they provide in the room be a futon with a dirty mattres which be already present in all cottage and in the name extra bed charge they provide just a bed

finally two of us wwnt to the kitchen for our food we all be so hungry and disappointed to see the plight of the room there be no phone in the room you nee to keep call the resort manager for ordering or any oth issue also please be careful while eat here the food charge be very high as compare to the quantity and the quality of food please go and eat outside rather than pay at this place please DO

which be ok if you be maintain it but it be not at all maintain you can see the picture how dirty and filthy the place be Food if i would have see the kitchen condition on first day i would n t have eat there at all it be filthy the pool be dirty Overall it be a shady place and if they would n t have take the money in advance which i feel very cheated to i would have leave on the first day itself this be my bad resort experience ever and i have stay at many for the amount of money they charge the offer filth Bad food dull location not worth the price Rigid in term of they will give food bill only with the room bill and not separate and blame on gst for that room be just average and old include the mattres and linen good part about this this resort be the proximty to the airport but its not too close so i could get a good night sleep it be also covenient if you want to do a little bit of sight seeing we be able to do some explore in and around Banglore city the service be also very

with family and friend for a recreational time Silent and green property very near to the airport B not so GOOD Food be ok and it take like one and a half hour to prepare it but its fresh Staff be OK there be a train track adjoin the property boundary train frequency be less C BAD wi fi be only in the busines area and not in room Rooms furnishing be old style i will be recommend this hotel if you be on a busines trip and would like to stay in the centre of the city the hotel be not at all very costly and the buffet as well as the lunch dinner be also very responsibly price Dont be expect much from the room decent room Service be also very nice and the staff be very helpful Consider this hotel have a budget hotel and dont expect a very lavish everything though term as a busines hotel it be equally suitable for all kind of traveler it be situate in a great locality with lot of shop around but the room be not noisy room be exactly as they appear in the photo Restaurant food be great and buffet price be good too Room amenity include the mini bar be great Staff be helpful and reception be open 24x7 highly recommend i be happy to choose this and also good to see the price which i m pay here food be good and servicing be nice happy to choose we love it by stay inn this place i can recommend this to everyone no doubt Nandhana Grand be a good hotel location be superb but very rarely be get this hotel i travel frequently to Bengaluru always want to stay in this hotel but rarely find available Management should work on this aspect otherwise hotel to stay very busy busines hotel often vouch by Corporates 60 foot road be anyways a busy street the Corporates like the hotel as it be a customization friendly hotel and have no major frill to increase the tariff of room Banquet hall be huge and very well maintain with ample sunlight and greenery in the french window Crockery be good and clean very well First and Foremost Banquet staff steward server and chef be very well mannered ready to help very polite with smile face Food be of very authentic Bangalorian taste with specific heritage spice and raw material use subtly to enhance the aroma and stimulate the taste bud Recommended for Corporate occupancy pls like my review if find helpful hotel be just locate in the posh area call koramangala very close to the CHRIST UNIVERSITY Me and family stay for a week for my daughter admission we have enjoy our stay at nandhana hotel one of the large hotel chain in south india Good hotel to have decent buffet Nice ambience Good service Affordable buffet price Limited veg non veg starter with one main course and biryani serve with naan Roti Desserts pani puri stall available Hotel be also know for premium sized room for stay this be in a costly place Koramangala you still would feel this be a place for a good night stay and with respect to food yes you have option and never mis an opportunity to go for non vegetarian dish Good overall stay food be tasty Staff be polite and nice Clean rooms though a little worn out the location be just perfect right in the heart of koramangala with easy acces to supermarket mall store pharmacy and food joint i stay for a night the staff be friendly and service be good they give only 2 small bottle of water per day for a room complimentary even if its a corporate booking so be mindful of that Sizes be quite decent Nandhana Grand be part of the Nandhana Group of hotel spread over Bengaluru the Nandhana Grand locate at Koramangala could be miss from the road as part of its front facade be occupy by a largish restaurant inside the reception be rather small though the room be comfortably large with a Queen size double bed an armchair and table but still leave sufficient space to move around the refrigerator hold the mini bar chargeable the cupboard hold the in room safe which be a good attraction the room be well decorate and the wall panel be attractively paint with hue of maroon and yellow ochre shade which make the room very pleasant warm and friendly i feel that the TV be place quite far from the bed on the opposite wall and hence not very clear since it be a 32 lead maybe the TV size should be large in tune with the size of the room all in all a very comfortable room the restaurant be a multi cuisine one and open till around 10 PM though we do not have any meal there Breakfast be adequate with the usual idli sambar cereal fruit poha etc with some continental stuff like fry potato etc throw in in case you prefer omelette or oth form of egg you will have to inform the staff Staff be friendly and helpful overall a nice hotel which invite one to re visit extremely good service awesome place to stay staff be very good love the stay over here room be good clean and food be good they treat their customer with immense respect and alwz ready to help although it be a busines visit and the hotel be get considerable busines from our contingent still the experience for us be very disappointing to start with the buffet dinner on the first day of our stay be a disaster we reach around 9 30 pm dinner timing be till 10 and many good item be already finish when we enquire the staff be if not rude very unprofessional Similar instance happen during our breakfast and oth interaction with staff anyways after a formal Complaint they try their good to pacify us but our experience be already sore also the location of the hotel be not ideal for family stay plus the food be lousy too i recommend it for solo traveller look to nothing specific but a happen night life experience Service provide by front desk be good Mr natrajan guide me in rite Manner stay 2 day happy and satisfied food be good staff be too polite and humble nice experience have in this hotel thank you guy there be a bar below the hotel which play heavy music till midnight a tired traveller need rest will find out difficult to sleep the staff upon enquiry say that they have receive many complaint but the management do n t care Go to the hotel only if you get a room far away from the music after several disappointing local 8ndian hotel this one improve the overall average significantly it be recommend by local friend as clean and safe i take the pricy premium room and book via Agoda Clean and spacious even have toilet paper and some toiletry but not all and not good quality so bre own the club on ground floor be loud and you wo n t sleep before midnight if you take room on 1st floor but i do n t mind that Its a very nice hotel stay there for 2 day with family the restaurant have good food the night manager be very helpful when we check in Will stay here again on my next visit have food bar and restaurant close by i have visit this Hotel many time before i have a good stay and the room be also cheap before GST now i feel that the room be too costly after the GST Hotelier Can you look into this and reduce the price so that we can afford it easily the location of the Hotel property be very good the property be nice but poorly maintain i have a deluxe room at the 4 the floor the furnishing be wooden and the room be quite large but poorly maintain the wardrobe have break wooden panel the bath tub in the bathroom be absolutely stain overall the room be not in good shape further the dinner serve in the buffet be hugely disappointing there be only one vegetable and that too the quantity be not enough hospitality of the staff be very poor i would advise stay in the hotel only in case your budget be tight and you be not find room in a good location Dont expect anything i have stay in this hotel on numerous occasion it be a pretty decent place then with nothing to complain and when i have to stay here recently i be surprised to see the quality of the hotel have come down start from the service to room and the food the food here be always good but this time it be just okay i be shock to see food be serve in plastic plate and cup and instead of ceramic in which they use to serve even in the restaurant the plate be of plastic there be not much to choose from in the buffet breakfast not sure why they have to lower the standard May be change in the management locate on a busy road in Koramangala above a pub Limited parking room be good run hot water an illusion Wifi poor Breakfast good Restaurant and in room dining expensive Cheap toiletry even delux room be small for the extra bed Room service excellent this hotel be in the heart of city on Koramangala Location wise good place to be as there be many restaurant lounge and pub nearby Hotel be well maintain and staff be nice as well as they response to you very quickly Room be OK there be few thing if those be be add to the room it would be good Breakfast at home be average i have give one extra point only for location locate in the heart of Koramangala the location of this establish hotel be the good part of the property the service and breakast be Ok the room be quite large probably since it be an old property however the lighting be dull and quality of interior can be improve espeically for the price this Hotel have a superb location in the middle of the famous kormangla all good eatery showroom be within 200 meter of this hotel kormangla club be also around 200to 300 meter only breakfast be good overall a good experience so i mail them a week before my schedule check in request for an early check in to my surprise they do n t reply to my email anyway i reach hotel on time and the guy ask me to open my laptop and send my i d to their email i d their printer be not work hence he make me open my laptop and literally force me to send the i d without they will not let me check in i tell him that i will send it from my room but he insist i do it now anyway send the i d and check in to the room so i book from makemytrip and in the pic deluxe room be have an recliner in the room which i fail to find Room look quite spacious in the pic but i be disappoint now come the food part as i be meet my client in hotel only i order from room service Food be expensive and not so tasty i even meet some of my client in their restaurant which be not have sufficient light and no prop cooling i have to ask them to turn on the cooler Wi Fi be free but reception guy tell me no limit but to my surprise it stop work after 1 GB i call reception and confirm that it only 1 GB per day so if you watch 30 40 minute video in 720 p the datum limit be over another disappointment it not an busines hotel in anyway if you be on a busines trip look elsewhere i go today to take a look at a room i ask the man there if i could please see one preferably on a high floor to minimize traffic noise he seem annoyed from the start and push a flyer in my face with relatively high price compare to what i see online i tell him that i would like to see the room first and then we can talk about the price he snap back that be the price and there be no bargaining take a bit back i look at him and say that i could book online but just want to see a room first but the way he be treat me make me reconsider even want to see a room with that he tell me to have a seat and wait then i be show a room on the first floor that seem quite nice but ask again if there be any available on a high floor he snap that all the room be the same i say ok so that room be 5000 rupee he snap again no that be the suite i see and be 7500 i tell him i do n t require a suite and would like to see the less expensive room he get even more annoyed and then have someone show me a deluxe normal room which be n t nearly as nice as the suite and frankly not at all worth 5000 rupee in fact the deluxe room be n t that nice at all i go back down and when he ask me what i think i tell him that i find it a bit expensive but would check online at the price he snarl something back to me and i explain it fine but for that price i could book a place online at the raddison or the marriot which be why i would like to check the price of this hotel online he then yell if you do n t like it you can go to another hotel at that point i have have more than enough of his additude and rudenes and say if you be go to act like this i do n t want to stay anywhere near you or this hotel i then walk out and find a decent hotel nearby for almost half the price i do n t understand what his problem be but i have find it always good to have a look at a room before booking in india since often the photo be far well than the reality if he get this rude with potential guest just for ask to see a room he have no busines in the hospitality busines stay in Nandana Grand for a couple of night during a busines trip this be locate in the happen locality of Koramangala the checkin be smooth and the deluxe room be quite comfortable the room be equip with all amenity expect for a busines hotel the good part for me be the staff who be well train and handle all your requirement courteously the room service be quick and the rate be pretty reasonable the breakfast also have a decent spread the food experience be quite satisfactory though the hotel be situate on a busy street the room be insulate from the noise and if you be a foodie you have a choice of restaurant which serve cuisine range from Karnataka Andra Chettinadu Mughlai Punjabi to Arabic Italian Chinese along this road a couple of point for improvement the shower area have a small partition without a door which result in a flood bathroom all the light switch be locate towards one side of the bed and be not 2 way switch sometimes become quite inconvenient when you want to switch ON off the light Overall quite a pleasant stay we have book this hotel for three of my colleague and it turn out to be a terrible mistake first we be ask to shift to another place despite have a confirm booking for 3 room because apparently some guest refuse to move out they then move us to a hometel which they promise be of the same category as the room we book but it be not even close there be no restaurant at the property and wifi and oth amenity be only a distant dream we cancel our booking and move to another place after one horrendous night not

about the hotel when you get in or the way to the hotel as it locate in the midst of residential area and not bang on the road etc but once you be in you will feel comfortable it purely mean for

the breakfast be ok it offer a nice selection of various food and egg be prepare freshly for the guest Hyatt Centric be no doubt a Classy place like most Hyatt s yet there be a certain Businesslike attitude towards guest not very warm so u feel like ur in a Hotel not a home due to the various if and don t Travel n trip be to unwind from daily stres so i think the staff in Centric need to loosen

you can expect from Hyatt the swimming pool be not clean when i check in but later it be make clean overall it be not a bad choice for busines traveler but it would be better stay in one of the five

still smell the paint in corridor Hotel in general and room in particular be a bit cramped but very clean and comfy Good breakfast Awesome restaurant staff with very friendly welcoming service but the front desk staff seem to always fold their face into the monitor they never make an eye contact with you and see you off in the morning or welcome you in evening Security guy be well at least that way Good WiFi never have problem Good gym with personal trainer in there Most of the in room TV channel seem to be pay per view subscription require i wish they have subscribe to most regional Indian

be friendly facility be clean restaurant food be very good room be perfect for a week long busines trip i even treat myself to a massage while i be there the price be reasonable and the service be very good Would definitely stay here again if i m back travel for work in the area Everything right from the ridiculously small room size to us be lock out for over an hour because their key stop work it run out of battery they couldnt fix it so after wait in the corridor for an hour we be ask to pack up shift room in the middle of the night to the break shower and iron box faulty wi fi they enter my husband detail erroneously and we have to have a guy come upto the room in the middle of the night and fix it for us again the experience be very underwhelming to say the least we pay premium price at a five star hotel to get a five star experience and not have the staff look at us begrudgingly when we list the issue we face our disappointment with the facility we will fix it the next time you come here how do that help me with the full charge that you have levy for a fully function room this time around waive off 1500 rupee for a breakfast up sell do not make the 17k 1500 be extra above these charge that we pay for a decent hotel stay experience for 2 day worth it the good bed i have ever sleep in and awesome food unfortunately Saturday night a loud party so i could n t sleep

be dark skinned they seem to be more interested in serve Caucasians which really do not go well with me i have to run around to get my spoon fork and towellette even glas for the water whilst my Caucasian friend next table get coffee serve at his table Instance 2 the food that i get serve in my room Chole batura the Puri be good but the chole be over cooked and be completely pathetic i try

experience and very helpful staff room be clean and breakfast spread be great Staff who serve us be very attentive and very helpful room be warm while outside be very cool well maintain hotel while i have stay at this Hyatt property before and even write a review previously they have go through a huge makeover and so deserve a second review from my recent stay the management have do a great job with the renovation while most of the aspect of the hotel may look same like before from the outside a lot have be do on the inside the room be a lot more chic and ooze a funky character the bathroom be sexy etc an absolute valume for money consider the location and the amenity facility you get acces to in house LOCATION right in the heart of the city and in a good part of MG road DINE DRINK Lovely Rooftop Lounge LIQUID and a cool restaurant Breakfast come with a fine choice of Regional and international cuisine ROOM i stay in 903 so this review be base on that VIEW Sweet view of the Metro Rail and the greenery behind along with the glamorous pool SIZE reasonably spacious room AIR CON perfectly function cooler that help in set the perfect room temperature BED Comfortable bed that play the expect part to put me to sleep BATHROOM Sexy Stand in shower decorate with colorful Goan style tile that add a glamorous touch toiletry very good Spa quality cosmetic FACILITIES a very decent Gym with a basic range of weight and Cardio machine and workout station the hotel also have a lovely outdoor pool that be not to be miss when the weather be good SERVICE Friendly staff that take care of all my need with a smile and make us feel pampered and well take care of how WIRED you WILL BE Free high speed Wi Fi that work well all over the property Big Plasma TV screen dish out dozen of channel span sport new music movie and a wide variety of entertainment in multiple language Clean Rooms Connectivity to city centre be good not very far from airport Overpriced though room be noisy as the hotel be close to main road and noise insulation in the window pane be not upto the mark overall very friendly and excellent service great room restaurant standard exact gym as expect only issue we encounter be that concierge forgot to get back to us regard a request several time until eventually we run out of time secondly we hire the hotel car one evening and bizarrely the hotel car have no gps so have to communicate directly with hotel lobby whom be use google map to relay back direction the oth odd thing be that the cost of the taxi be almost the same as a single night stay in fact it cost more than have a private doctor come visit medication Strange place for punitive pricing strategy Anyway overall would still recommend the hotel location be bang centre of Bangalore too Excellent service i be constantly surprise by their kind team who always go above and beyond Breakfast be delightful and the pool patio provide a nice respite from the noise and crazines of MG road unlike it giant peer this be a nice quiet hotel but close to all the action Excellent service and great staff always very helpful the hotel food Indian be great but slightly westernize the location of the hotel hear Trinity Circle be perfect for both work and vacation recently renovate room which be a nice change we stay 9 night here for the second time this year hope this time it would be well than the last i be once again very disappointed i be at the Hyatt Andaz 5th Avenue a few month ago and compare it now to this the service be horrible the staff be supremely incompetent Most of them scramble around to find their place let alone help the guest the room be small and not worthy of the price when we need to providr feedback and ask to see the manager Varun Mohan he turn out to be a self entitled kid he be so rude that we feel offended to continue the conversation never come back here ever i pick the Hyatt for a short stay in December it have the good rate for the day i be stay compare to its nearby peer the Taj Oberoi and the Conrad the review be positive and the icing on the cake be the car service to and from the airport book the room be hassle free and i be able to have Ms Vibhuti take care of my preferred room in less than 10 minute she also arrange for reservation for my airport pick up and drop off a few day before my stay i receive a phone call confirm my stay and my option which i think be a pleasant touch i arrive in the wee hour of the morning but my ride be ready Mr Jeelani and Mr Sagayaraj be prompt courteous the vehicle be non smoking immaculately maintain and the drive be very smooth and comfortable the drive be a bit long but worth it give the close hotel to the new airport cost nearly 1 5 time the price i pay include the ride at the front desk Ms Anupama and Mr Akshay make sure i have a smooth check in the room with king side bed be just the right size for a single traveler if you be travel with family i d recommend ask for a big room the room be well lay out art work line the wall and the decor be chic the bathroom and toilet be equally well do Water be complimentary and so be the WIFI both of which be plus for me since i drink copious amount of water and consume datum like water i have expect the location of the hotel to have some road and traffic noise surprisingly the window be well insulated and i be able to rest from my journey without any issue it could be that my room do not face the busy M G Road the next morning i dine at the hotel restaurant for breakfast INR 900 get you a splendid array of eastern and western fare i especially enjoy the croissant and the make to order omelette the fresh fruit and juice be a highlight idli and the chutney be just delicious Service be quick and the holiday season mean there be n t many busines traveler stay anyway i decide to dine at the same restaurant for dinner and it be worth the short walk from my room i settle for a mocktail red rice and lasooni dal to keep thing simple Snigdharani and Chef Yashwant make the evening memorable Check out and my ride back to the airport be equally smooth i d definitely recommend stay here for busines it be centrally locate with plenty of dining and shopping option i know this because i have live in Bangalore in a past life the service be impeccable yet not aggressive the amenity be top notch for the price Warmth well come by a beautiful lady name shere with a cute smile escort to the table the food and ambience be excellent Thank you to sajal and manjil for the service you both make like feel at home and also specially

eatery dot the Ulsoor area i be greet by a smile hostes and lead to the al fresco area which be landscape in tropical fashion with a pool in its midst Choice of food span from European Asian Chinese and length n breadth of India interestingly i also spot a counter serve sorbet but the good part of the whole affair be the barbeque serve a choice of Indian and American style grill while most of the place serve a very predictable spread Bangalore brasserie definitely manage to surprise us i be really surprised to look at the condition of hotel room that too for a Suite whenever i be order in room dining or prepare tea in the room all this be lead to red ant ant be there be the bathroom bedroom and living room as well even on the towel there be no end to these ant and i have complain a couple of time as well infact when the house keep incharge come for inspection the ant be still there this be really irritating and make me sick some picture attach for your reference on top of it staff be so rude and be hardly bother infact the Manager of Hyatt Centric suggest me to Stay in Marriot rather than Hyatt as he be an old employee from marriot and their hotelquality be good this be really not Hyatt Standards i choose for Hyatt even though it be far from my office only because i trust in the brand and property but this be shocking and not acceptable just love my stay here the smell around make me clam happy relaxxxe the view from my room be awesome my toddler love the bed overall a comfy stay at hyatt Bangalore will surely look forward for my next visit over all its a nice experience

breakfast itself have a lot of variety and be up to the mark room be nice and clean as be the bathroom the room isnt particularly spacious but fine as long as its for one person two people would nee

person great location mcd just a stone throw away and a small mall be nearby Keep up the good work Hyatt Staff be very frankly and friendly personally Dolan in restaurant he be very helpful thank you Dolan to help me for good choice of food and he always remember that i be have madical problem Depti Abhishek in room sarvice thank the location be the good part of Hyatt Centric Easy acces to all part of the city be available from the hotel its still a new Hyatt so i gues they be still in the learning mode Breakfast be a decent spread and staff be genuinely friendly and nice so that a definite plu the hotel itself require some upgrading as there be quite a few evident factor that the building be an old one the wall painting in the room add a very chique touch the room be quite recently upgrade although a bit small but it be comfortable for a short stay of 5 day the breakfast be amazing the bed and pillow be also super comfy and the overall staff be super attentive and friendly we thoroughly enjoy our stay in this bustling city i stay in the hotel for a busines trip and be not disappoint by the facility offer by the hotel the room be neat and clean and the staff be responsive another benefit be the location depend if you have in this part of the city i like the breakfast but only suggestion be that the hotel prepare more of south indian spread for the breakfast Pl add more variety if that permit Overall i would recommend the property the hotel be very centrally locate mall eatery be close by love the restaurant specially the open area for have breakfast the service level can be well Nice compact room recommend for short stay its nice cosy small property right on the end of MG road the room be very small and the washroom be even small if i have to compare the room it be comparable to IBIS which you be mentally prepared will be small the room maintenance be not that great while they be clean as the hotel be new but the housekeeping be not upto mark as i have some hair most likely from the person who would have use the room last on the couch which be not remove during my 2 night stay this be my first visit to Bangalore and the hotel be ideally locate in the centre near the major bank shopping and excellent restaurant the City have a great buzz with which the hotel be in synch i travel to Bangalore on regular basi and prefer to stay in Hyatt i personally think despite that the stay be costly the Hotel provide a great value for the price the staff be strive to provide an atmosphere of understanding of one need and preference to provide a very personal service be welcome by name and ask if one would like to have the choice of the previous morning be quite nice the restaurant provide beside the outstanding service also very good food my favorite choice at Hyatt Centric Bangalore Chicken Tikka Masala with garlic naan Enjoy Good place to stay the hotel be aptly locate the reception area be small and look congested probably they can improve on that also there be no option to park your own car and get to the room overall if you get a good deal on the room then it be an nice option to stay Hyatt Centric Bangalore have jump to the top of my Favorite Hotels list the moment i arrive i feel welcome like family as a solo female traveler to India and my first time in Bangalore the staff at Hyatt Centric go out of their way to make

go out of his way on a number of occasion to help me in fact i have lose one of my belonging in the hotel which he ensure reach back to me safely in Gurgaon Only drawback of the hotel room be quite small overall i have good experience the staff be attentive i have a light fever over the weekend and the staff have accede to my request for customize food and they have show concern on my well being Room be good and clean i get a room that be face the lake though it be quite far and block by another hotel but i do like the room especially i have to spend few hour work in the room i love the design of the tile in the shower area i experience two minor issue though one there be this blast of music during the weekend of my stay which i suspect come from 4th floor and it reach 7th floor where i stay i could n t begin to imagine the level of noise experience by people at low level room secondly i have unpleasant experience during check out due to system failure and the promise of get my confirmation before deduct the amount from my credit card do not happen fortunately i do n t have anything to dispute about also i do not get my invoice until i make two international call to the hotel to request for the electronic invoice to be send to my email i still do not receive the invoice after my first call arrange airport tx with hyatt and stay here for 3nightd while the property be well keep clean and modern the big concern i have be on my way in from airport the airport tx be at late night and the driver drive us back be sleep now and then my colleague and i raise it also but no action be take by the hotel very concern and not a great entry to the visit Excellent team and location as well Entire team of this hotel be care and will always do extra than request i will recommend this hotel specially if you be visit for the official purpose Food be also good though they have limit option on menu if you desire to have something which be not on menu then they will get it make Service be also very quick of all the department i be have breakfast at Bengaluru Brasserie on 28th September Morning and i find a live insect in my food what add fuel to the fire be how they react to complaint which be outrageous Nobody give a damn about the complaint i have to call up the restaurant manager to bre this into his notice to settle thing up the restaurant manager offer a fruit basket lol which i return of course although i have have a mixed bag of experience with this hotel where i have stay in the past this time i give this another try only to find out about their poor customer handling skill and to know that they dont give a damn about food quality and customer experience there be a tone of hotel that care a lot about customer Dont waste your experience time and money here at this pathetic hotel the hotel be in a good central location and yet accessible by small back road to avoid traffic well maintained and yet modern it just right for busines trip i really like the breakfast and dinner at the Bengaluru Brasserie as well Would highly recommend for oth busines traveler too Today we be in Bangalore at the Hyatt Centric a beautiful structure locate in the center of the city unfortunately i spend only one night in this structure but i can without a shadow declare that it be beautiful the entrance be a little subdued for the complex that house but the beautiful arrive in the room not big mind you but clean and furnish with a lot of style the gem of the room be the bathroom they be really good at decorate them then as usual let s move to the gym as well how good a score 7 equip the right to train well in both weight and aerobic very clean and tidy there be a SPA but i can not tell you how it be because i have not use it a multi ethnic restaurant accompany the evening to the full Do not expect page and page of manu but if you do not want to take the car be the right place highly recommend Expensive hotel but distinctly average overall air conditioning in room be too noisy have several power outage include one which turn all the light on in the middle of the night gym change room be dirty food be good but selection of drink be poor only one type of beer available Kingfisher no import beer overall not good value for money visit for a quick busines trip stay one night Location 5 5 Hotel Room quality 5 5 Service staff 5 5 have a comfortable stay and a seamless checkin an checkout exp Value for money experience great place to stay and staff be very cooperative Food be great and accommodation be close to shopping and central to transportPrice be reasonable Staff look after us very well include make it home i stay in the Hyatt for 2 night while in Bangalore on a busines trip there be plus and minus to the experience what go well a the property be clean and i feel safe important as a woman travel alone and comfortable throughout my stay b the food and beverage team be excellent the breakfast buffet be pretty good but what really elevate the experience be the proactive polite friendly service a bearded gentleman very sorry do n t remember the name especially go above and beyond the call of duty to deliver an impeccable experience what could have be improve a the room be really really small about the size of the airport transit hotel in Changi however they be cozy and comfortable b i have to repeatedly ask for the turndown service in the evening i gues there be no adequate communication between the housekeeping staff tip 1 the main advantage of this hotel be the location a 5 minute walk away from 1 MG road mall a 15 minute drive from Manipal hospital 2 there an iron board and box a fairly ok work desk and a kettle with facility to make tea and coffee 2 it may not be worth it pay for a suite for that price you may as well stay at the Leela or the Taj i have the opportunity to Stay at the Hyatt Centric in Bengaluru this be an excellent property and provide a ideal place to rest and recoup after a day of hard work and the maddening traffic and snarl of Namma Bengaluru even though it be just of the main Road it be totally cutoff and provide you a serene stay experience the staff be good and know their job look around the location it will surely be a great place even for Families as everything be near by include Theaters Commercial complexes Metro what more can you ask for

ice cream order come out a bit frosty water crystal could be see and could smell the smell of the chiller in that scoop of ice cream but to my surprise the chef come out to apologise for the same and offer an alternative it wasnt really much of a big deal but i truly appreciate the chef and the FNB staff for show concern and to compensate they waive off our two hot chocolate drink i be phone call late hour approx 11 pm or lil later to be inform about the house rule as i have a female school friend of mine and be ask to skoot out of the room cause the booking be make for 1 person i find that the way it be convey to me kind of tone or pitch and the word use by the staff via phone call be rude and disrespectful and they seem quite blatant about it Suranjana and oth FO staff present at the time apologise for the same Nothing wrong as they be just do their job it give me a feeling as if i be be judge to be a punter if nothing less if i would have be inform about the house rule upon check in this would have never happen provide both my friend and i have provide our government photo ID as request upon check in it would have be more appropriate if instead of them ask me to skoot out of the room and chill by the lobby or the restaurant a simple question would your friend be accompany you tonight and if so would you like me to change your booking to two adult and the cost of that would be whatever the extra person cost be as a guest I wasnt give that option lastly the security guy be so polite and amiable be here for breakfast with friend be an amazing time with great hospitality Kiran with his team of Tshirin snigdha Rukhsana Sajal the buffet spread be well plan with mix of continental and Indian cuisine along with bakery item good part be their eagernes to serve

kitchen and self cooking option available bedroom have AC family room be non AC Good furniture available nicely decorate room bathroom be good Terrace be nicely decorate with plant and have a breakfast lounge thing which pathetically lag compare to the room quality be their service it be terrible by call multiple time you wo n t get any service only i get prompt service when i call for water because it be pay Bath towel be never replace on my 3 night stay even after multiple request and on 2nd day if you can stay with your own this service apartment be good but if you be habituate

clean and have all the amenity A C TV Wifi etc the kitchen have all the require appliance and cooking stove they also have generator backup which come in very handy when the electricity go off due to

touch highly recommend locate very close to Bannerghatta road Maple Suites be the perfect place to stay in especially if you be stay with your family each room have its own attached kitchenette and an ante room with a sofa and a dining table the room be sufficiently furnish and neatly maintain provide a place like home away from home Excellent place to stay with family Helpful staff Peaceful surrounding Good infrastructure Clean Good food in short a home away from home i would highly recommend Maple Suites Serviced Residences this be my second stay at Maple which say it all i have to say i be really disappointed when i arrive for my second time and i be allocate a deluxe suite which have window face wall luckily for the last two night be in the airy bright premium one but otherwise the staff be really great it be so clean and well maintain and the food be absolutely delicious highly recommend although it may impact on overbooke i would just say book in advance and specify which acco you want which i do n t realize i have stay here for 2N3D the hotel be in old city with good connectivity the breakfast have a variety of spread and the menu be n t repeat which be good Dinner at the restaurant be good too the restaurant be by pool side so it be awesome room be clean and well maintain i would recommend it to Family and Business traveler we stay here during May 2019 with family we book three room which be really big with kitchen and dining space the reception and room service be good but they nee improvement in their restaurant department and house keeping Locate in quite place but near the market area the ambience be really good and the location of the hotel be also good personally i like the restraunt with swimming pool you will get only vegetarian food in the restraunt and the taste be good Staff be polite Astris Melange be a very good and nice hotel me and my friend stay at this hotel for 2 month we all come for special treatment and we find this hotel as the good value for money and above for us Its have good facility and nice pool Breakfast be great and very rich with all variety of Indian and western food and also fresh juice fruit and vegetable Its a vegetarian only in the hotel the hotel Chef be excellent you can find all you nee around the hotel although its on main road its very quiet inside all the hotel team be very nice and smile people i have stay at this place for the weekend when i come to Bangalore to search for a house as i be move there the room be good in line with what you would expect the check in and check out proces be very smooth and the breakfast buffet be good especially the live dosa counter we go there in night at 10 30 they give the room after 20 minute no room service for even water next day we not check out because of luggage etc we book it for three people they charge double of previous day again extra bed payment do on line in morning they provide bed at 11 30 pm after one hour request they not provide water on payment just give only half litre bottle they say room service be poor and i ask manager to look after this they be not cooperating they be make money only at the time of checkout they ask us not leave unless they check room very very unprofessional Do not get carry away by the pic at least here beauty be only skin deep recommend if you re vegetarian without anyone to visit you do not intend to sleep and get a high on traffic sound Corner property overlook the main road and flyover with three window in the room cause round the clock traffic noise and this on 7th floor be certain this would be the state in most room seem soundproofing overlook Windows have no curtain only office style Venetian blind that allow light to pas though even at night and by 6 be the room be bright my sleep be do away with because of the noise and light visitor be n t allow into the room it a hotel policy but not mention anywhere online nor do they inform while make the reservation hence do not expect to entertain your relative friend in the room the folk at the reception have be program to give some absurd reason for this Restaurant serve only veg food again no prior mention of it Substandard toiletry though they claim to be luxury aparthotel and poor ventilation in the washroom this be the state of premium studio room i stay two night at the Chancery Pavilion which i recommend across the road where i have no inconvenience at all and want to try this place hence move in here for a night but be glad i be alone and do n t have my family on this trip the fancy HOsTEL love our stay in this hotel great room great breakfast and great service good hotel we have stay in Bangalore so far Breakfast be vegetarian only but a good choice and all be fresh we will be back we be on a family holiday to Bangalore and stay at the Astris for 5 night i have to say that we have a fantastic time they have a great and polite staff and be very accommodate the room be very clean and tidy the food be excellent there we eat many a time at the cafe there and never have any complaint the only thing that i would request them to look into be get some hotel taxi for the guest that stay there sometimes it be a real problem get an auto rickshaw or even an uber from the hotel even though its in one of the prime locality of the city very good place to stay at very comfortable and have a very good vibe with its premium studio there be good place around such as Fanoos and Fatima bakery right around the corner available overall a very good experience i have be to this hotel for a day the staff where very friendly there be a good response from the room service people too Preferable for woman who be plan to stay alone the cafe library and the pool be also excellent you should visit once to come again and again before every visit in Bangalore i stay in different hotel never twice in one but now i book a room only in this hotel it good for bussine because in the center and they have facility for family and for solo traveler also our stay be comfortable food and service be good would definitely recommend to other location be also good and rate be also worthy on the whole have a great experience as be stay first time in this particular hotel in Bangalore after a very long time i have to go to bangalore and book this place base on review and it be right very neatly maintain and spacious room centrally locate Staff be friendly totally worth the money Would certainly recommend to other this my fifth stay in this hotel Good staff hygienic room toilet good location nice

i like the most about this hotel be the wide bed the breakfast be vegetarian and the spread can have more variety the restaurant by the poolside be lovely i would recommend an apartment in the upp floor we stay at the property for a weekend have good restaurant and staff service the gym be well equip with the necessary equipment for a good workout Clean Rooms Friendly staff Will recommend this property for a long stay Clean room with all accessory courteous service excellent location however buffet breakfast 100 vegetarian not even egg item still stay worth it money definitely recommend to friend with family well maintain service apartment though i get a room without kitchen i get room next to Service Lift and lot of noise into the room whenever lift operate Restaurant or Cafe attach be pure vegetarian also this apartment be at a good location Room service be good i stay over Melange Astris for a busines trip Horrible experience i be look for a internet connection to connect my laptop and say internet be not work for a long time no response sadly i be not able to connect and do n t have datum card so miss my meeting with the client what more you can expect from here this a very well maintain service appartment with the kitchen fully equip the room be large and be good for a long duration stay and if you wish to feel it home this be the good option locate very close to good mall in city the only problem be with the restaurant that only serve vegetarian cuisine and have not much option to really indulge in the way out be to use the fully equipped kitchen i gues wonderful experience great location good food excellent staff the wifi be fast value for money right in the heart of the city close to may food joint shopping center easy to reach will recoomend Clean well maintain serviced apartment room be spacious with pantry fitout Breakfast be a good spread but only VEG Place boast a pool gym library and a lounge Staff at front desk and restaurant be friendly downside WIFI password proces involve call reception and a security guard get send to your room to convey the password a bit annoying Bathroom fit out appear date big down side be the the noise from the Richmond flyover that rebound from the surround building and be a constant disturbance invest into heavy drape and a few soft rug may have help get the noise level down i would recommend Melange Astris if you re look for a place to stay when in Bengaluru Great location and walkable distance to prime location like MG Road Brigade Road Lavelle Road beautifully do up interior high level of hygeine and wonderful staff the room be a comfortable size and the bed just right the breakfast be delicious and have enough variety for every taste i know where i will be stay on my future trip to

accord to the menu to the room till up to 10 30 pm or go down or up to eat in Staff in the restaurant pleasant while take order or plate it on the table there be a nice pool beside the restaurant with a waterfall on one side really gutte as i i do not have time to use it in the short 2 night stay at the hotel only drawback be that they dont serve any alcoholic drink and non vegetarian food but you can order food from oth restaurant detail can be find in the room who deliver to you i be not a fan of non veg food but feel i nee a glas of beer after a hard day and have to go and get it myself from

specially nayan moni in reception he be very helpful and humble guy i really him a lot and housekeeping staff also the Melange Astris should be one of the top place to stay in Bangalore with spacious room and value for the money however its not if you want a place with an attitude and robust moral policing this be your place this place be a little different from the oth hotel in the area the room have interesting shape to them and be spacious some room look like studio with full kitchen while oth room be full blown apartment with a bedroom however the room be start to look worn and hotel be slowly fall into the trap of not maintain the property correctly just look at the traveler photo their online picture look like they be shoot when the hotel open Breakfast could be a lot well currently its all VEG with no option for at least egg or omelet they only offer one or two continental option like pancake which be not great Most morning i be reduce to eat toast with coffee and then we have an incident with the front desk on two different occasion we leave the hotel fly to another city while maintain the room with our substantial luggage because we be come right back this mean that on multiple night our room sit empty on both occasion the front desk staff see us leave and return one night a friend come to visit and stay late he could not find an Uber or Ola cab to take him home we decide it would be good if he spend the night give that our room have two bed in the morning he have breakfast with us that day someone in the front desk call me over while we be on our way out they proceed to complain about our friend spend the night and effectively react as if we be try to cheat them they tell me that we be go to have to pay for an extra guest and for their brilliant breakfast buffet the conversation occur in an accusatory tone and finally look through the online comment and response on TripAdvisor we find this brilliant nugget from the General Manager of the hotel NOTE Hotel may deny check in to unmarried unrelated couple without prop baggage ID and Address proof this be at full discretion of the hotel management and also same have be inform to display in all our on line portal whom we be deal with what exactly be proper baggage i wonder then we find this on a different reservation site guest be require request to produce a marriage certificate or any

nice breakfast also very good staff also nice and quick overall a pleasant stay at the hotel centrally locate Staff very good service Clean room be well equip and fully amenity Breakfast be a vegetarian which should be non vegetarian for some foreigner Location be within reach to place like Commercial street MG road Garuda mall etc this be a nice hotel that be very modern and clean with great facility include a really nice outdoor pool area and great food however at time the service leave a little bit to be desire when we check in we be give no information about WiFi breakfast time etc the reception staff appear to have to transfer all query to somebody else via multiple phone call and the restaurant staff didnt seem to know how to serve food when we be sit at the table we assume most people order room service it be also a little bit difficult to find the hotel Google map position it at a completely different location and the addres take us about a 5 minute walk from where the hotel be less fundamentally the instrumental saxophone music play throughout the hotel may not be to everyones taste especially as we visit in April and the play list include several Christmas tune but overall this be a good hotel and be great value for money Its down side be more commercial than problematic nice boutique hotel with well appoint spacious room clean bathroom and a prompt staff hotel be peaceful and quite they also have a complementary laundry room for their guest where you can wash your clothe without any extra charge all be god expect that in my room when i check in there be some problem with the electricity which be fix within 30 minute but when i reach back into the hotel at night there be n t any power in my room for which again i have to call the maintenance and fault be from their main switch server and be correct but the bad be during mid night around 1 be when my sleep be disturb as suddenly feel hot and wake up to realize that the AC be n t work again and have to call the maintenance again i have an early morning flight next morning and here i be get the electricity fix i love stay here Service be above and beyond except for the fact there be no public WiFi till you actually check in which be a bit difficult to those of us travel from outside India with no Sim Card it be quickly remedie by an early check in that be my only recommendation be that they set up a guest account for WiFi for anyone that arrive before check in i would definitely stay again and would love to thank the staff for their kindnes and skill at make our time in Bangalore amazing a very Good Option for both Long and short stay Premium Studios and Apartments be very comfortable and spacious one of the few place that provide spacious room and bed very convenient to move around from Richmond a lot of food option within the vicinity of 2 Kms the only concern be on maintenance of plumbing which i find need attention stay at the hotel for just a night but would love to be back Amazing hotel extremely well design room as per the tariff great staff the highlight be the poolside breakfast on the 4th floor Good spread and flawless service Keep it up Melange Astris Check in be a bit slow even at 2 am breakfast be vegetarian only but a good selection the pool area be next door to the restaurant but the water be freeze cold this time of year the

be above par Limitations to F B option as property just have 1 vegetarian restaurant with no liquor license however option be available to order food from outside Hotel do n t provide any concierge service still do nt be surprised to find out management do seek about feedback about it through guest comment card the only good thing about this hotel be its location the staff be totally unprofessional they have weird rule like you nee to carry a trolly bag for checkin or else you ll be deny reservation they do n t even refund your money such a ridiculous rule if you re travel with your family please do n t visit this place they cause total inconvenience during checkin they serve only veg food and their restaurant be very dirty Parking space be also cramp up the hotel be locate

Airport which be true for most of the traveler who use to stay in this Hotel the room be tidily and neatly set for your entry the moment you enter the room you would have the feeling of convenience and comfort Ma am be always present there at the front desk to addres any simple request you may have in mind be it local information and outing or the nearby option to spend the evening Security guy be friendly enough to get a auto for you in case you struggle in find a rent cab to go out in the evening owe to infamous Bengaluru traffic Breakfast and buffet dinner have an expansive and scrumptious spread of delicacy ensure all type of palate be satisfied the service guy at the restaurant be ready to serve any small request you may have owe to ongoing Metro work i miss the experience of Swimming Pool which unfortunately nothing due to the fault of the hotel there be enough of in room dining option to satisfy your taste bud Service be really quite prompt and i would really appreciate their responsiveness in this regard there be dedicate travel desk who be there to help you with any kind of sightseeing or busines need however the cab interior and comfort could have be little bit better not a complaint but a suggestion only Service guy be smile and more than cooperative to make you feel comfortable always overall this be a super pleasant stay for me for a short trip at Bengaluru and i would surely look forward to visit them once again to pamper and enjoy their hospitality Good job do by the management and the entire team Keep it up i travel from Hyderabad to Mumbai for a 3 i i busines conference to be hold in Fortune Select trinity as the conference be in this hotel and consider the Bangalore traffic plus the rating me and my colleague decide to stay here from 25th night to 28th oct we have also get a airport pick up arrange and give the concerned travel desk person our flight detail we receive a confirmation message with our arrival timing travel Co ordinator number and also state that the driver will be wait for us 1 hour before the arrive time of 9 50pm to our surprise when we reach Bangalore we couldnt find any driver wait for us we literally go around 2 3 time only to confirm if we havent miss it we then call the number which be suppose to be the travel co ordinator number one of which apparently be earlier a travel desk number and now belong to fortune cosmo or something like that and the oth travel CO ordinator number be switch off not know what to do as it be late night and consider that the travel from airport to the hotel be 1 5hours we desperately look for oth number find a landline number speak to the travel agent through that and be tell that the driver be right there but isnt able to find us and we give our number 10 min after that the driver call us and ask us if we have land astonish by the question we tell him its be long that we land and enquire where he be he then mention that he be still on the way and the hotel give him wrong time and tell him that we be arrive at 10 55 instead of 9 50pm after which we call the travel desk person and he tell us that he get the flight number wrong and thus incorrect arrival time while clearly thats a lie as they have mention our arrival time in their message and the right flight number speak to him again and he blatantly again lie to us that the driver be right there after all this drama a driver reach out to us at the airport shout out the hotel name and we finally take a sigh of relief however we see that he be hold some oth guest name and arrival detail and wasnt expect two lady but a male person we speak to the travel desk person and somehow get into the car upon reach the hotel we be obviously furious and find out that the travel desk person have leave for the day as his duty end and there be no one in the hotel who be even apologetic about what have happen when we narrate it to the front office person he tell us that he will have to check with the travel desk and get back the next day its be 1 5 day here and no one have approach us or apologise to us all and all i wouldnt suggest this place to anyone as i dont see the staff management have any kind of courtesy or empathy for their guest the ambience be good Staff be friendly Front desk team be very accomodative Room Service be satisfactory i be mostly outside the hotel for official work but i recomend other to join this hotel for family official trip the staff and service make a huge difference Prompt and always a pleasure come back after a long day the staff of the hotel be excellent and friendly specially Sanjay Rawat very sincere and helpful Comfortable and good interior of room my room be excellent amenity also excellent and breakfast be fabulous we be frequent traveler and must say this be one of our favorite hotel from the moment we arrive until we leave the service and amenity be excellent the vibe be very natural and healthy and they walk the talk Great Spartan Gym which have everything you nee we will definitely be back the hotel be superb and room be also spacious the hotel be very well maintain the service be great and the restaurant be really good the location be also very good in case you want a stay in whitefield or nearby area however hard i think i be not able to find one fault with the property so probably i should for the sake of complain say the acces to this property be a traffic nightmare with Metro work go on for over a year now the always smile Manjunath at the bell to the staff at the reception and the restaurant it be comfort all the way the room be quite large i have stay there twice in the last 2 month Food at the restaurant be quite a spread of tasty menu overall i would go again there whenever i travel to Bengaluru stay here for a long stay Staff be good specially Munna from service he ensure all that be need well before i order he have be my food advisor right from the morning tea upto dinner Good job keep it up very good stay nice hotel and very spacious hotel Net and clean and week behave staff Food be very good Lot of option in breakfast Location wise very good and reachable to oth place room be comfortable and neat and clean Clean spacious room with standard room amenity Advisable to avoid the dinning section dinner buffet be horrible cold limited option very few salad option that too mostly empty not refill not worth the price they charge Traffic outside be messy horrible so outside food option be also pain Check oth hotel in same price range nearby before finalizing there be plenty some may be well choice then this one Nice room Good co operative Staff Wonderful B fast Recommend this Ultimate place near in center of city almost all aminitie be there except speed of Wifi Internet also if you be lucky you will get complimentart upgrade as well Nice hotel nice service all over gud comfertble restaurant nice staff and Sanjay rawat be too gud and service be awesom he be very smile face and lot of knowledge about the food and service and sure in future I m back again this property i like it be expect a little more from what the hotel offer be an ITC property the room stink and i change 2 room for the same reason the washroom be dark and dingy the mattres be too hard and give me a back ache i usually be very accommodative and not much of a cribber but this hotel disappoint me do highlight the issue to the Front Desk and be assure of well service next time the hospital do n t have any issue though the team be great and promptly change my room on request hope for a well room quality if i ever stay here again Fortune Select Trinity be a perfect hotel for the busines traveller Excellent room to go with probably the good breakfast buffet in this clas the ever smile Lady Manager at the Front Office make every guest feel important overall a good property for the time be this property could be a bad choice due to the ongoing Bengaluru Metro Rail Construction in Whitefield area heavy traffic too much of construction dust and vehicle pollution since it on a prime road way into ITPL for your information when i arrive at the property Valet Parking be not available part of the parking garage be destroy for the Metro Rail Construction hence a limited parking facility only available to use room be fine service be fine restaurant be ok overall good not excellent Excellent hotel with good food and excellent room the room be really big and spacious and extremely clean have everything that you can ask for very good for expat and highend bussines traveller and also for family this be the first time i be stay at the Fortune Select Trinity Whitefields as our meeting be schedule in that area i be not sure what to expect so i check in at 4 00 pm and right from the bellboy to the door keeper it be a very warm welcome the Front office be very efficient and give me my room which be street face and the entire proces be complete in less than ten minute the room be very large with a beautiful view of Whitefields in the background however there be some metro work happen right outside the main road where the hotel be locate the swimming pool be currently close due to the metro construction the breakfast service be very efficient and the buffet have a wide array of item to choose from on the whole i would rate this experience as excellent some very good staff member and outstanding service Spacious room quality food and service customer friendly good place to stay the hotel be good to catch up for office friend family the restaurant have variety of food sure you will love it i have a good time awarenes and consciousnes of staff cleaning of all area an location easy and hassle free place but the overaLl the experience be memorable for us and they also have good bar and room be good to stay this hotel be perfect for all busines traveller with a great location it be a good experience the room be very spacious cleanly maintain the Staffs be very supportive and cooperative high room be generally quiet with some view Food be decent corridor be maintain Pool be not operational you can still use big lawn gym for walk workout Good connectivity to whitefield busines hub Good option for a day stay there be metro construction be happen and the pool be not operational the room be good and everything be fine the breakfast be normal and service of the staff be good what make Fortune a real fortune for guest be the good knowledgeable Fantablous awesome staff member include security reception in room dining chef bar staff everyone be so awesome if my next trip be plan i will search for Fortune only i stay for 2 week in room 5114 and everyday be so beautiful and during checkout at a moment i feel that im leave my home my visit be quite disappointing they claim to be a 5 star hotel but be in between 2 and 3 star the only resturant serve stale food and the staff be quite arrogant the gym facility literally do not exist yes they have 3 treadmill and 2 cros trainer you will have be in queue to use one also just outside the hotel metro work be go on which add to more issue there be well hotel around the same locality i have stay here a lot of time everytime i come to Bangalore Whitefield the only place i stay be at Fortune Select people here be very helpful few of them i would like to personally thank be Mr Dilip Das his hospitality his helpful behaviour make you feel very comfortable there have be few cleanines issue and i have mention it to him and it have immediately be take care of Mr Vasu at the breakfast

Fortune Select i stay in Trinity last week for one day overall it be a very comfortable stay The people at the reception be very polite and helpful especially Ms Sheila the room be good and quiet hygienic The food at the restaurant be very nice the quantity be too good for 2 people We order lunch with two dish but it be too much for two of us to consume similarly at night we order for just one plate of Delhi Chaat but the quantity be quite large we have to ask to pack the remain portion the morning breakfast spread have a lot of variety and the food be really good the lawn be well keep but some portion of it have be cordone off due to the ongoing Metro work maybe that be the reason that their health spa and gym facility also look secluded as some part of it have be affect by the metro work and swimming pool be not at all functional the only negative point be the location as it purely suit some one on busines trip as it be locate on the main road we want to go out at night for post dinner walk but the road outside have such heavy traffic that one can not dare to move out Within the hotel premise it be nice and pleasant the food buffet be excellent there be variety in the food and quality be good the hotel staff be also friendly i take the standard room which be just ok however be upgrade to the club room and it be more comfortable room be spacious Restaurant service be not that great we nee to ask for basic thing as well Food taste be ok Room cleaning service be good for busines trip if cab facility be include in room price then that will be good as most of the hotel provide that free of cost if the stay be for 2 week my stay be for 3weeks Swimming pool be close due to metro work and it difficult to walk near the hotel due to metro work i do nt blame hotel for this i stay at Fortune Select Trinity for about 11 day this May have certain issue regard Air Conditioner work in my room and i inform the matter to Front Desk and they escalate the issue to Sheila from that day she ensure she be update on the issue every hour and she do not rest till my issue get completely resolve Special Thanks to Sheila this hotel be one of the good hotel in Bangalore the

in the ask me to share a copy of my credit card amex card have cvv on front something which every medium channel state not to do secondly even if you be check in for a week they ask you to make the payment upfront cause they do nt trust their guest to pay them and now i know why 1 the dinner buffet spread be really shabby i survive on dal roti and fruit the chef be kind enough to realise that a fat woman need to eat so he make me some chicken 65 which be the save grace 2 the room be unkempt day 1 there be no toiletry in my room i have to individually call house keeping at the risk of sound prude when we pay for a four star our expectation be of the same 3 the shower tub be break in my room mind you this be my second room change i finally end up change three room for a period of 3 night and 2 day i narrowly escape scrape my bum cause the muddy water make me dig a bit deep the staff in the diner and the front office be very receptive but there be absolutely no involvement of their GM or any senior staff Pathetic Would strongly recommend Holiday inn which be just 3 km away and know how to treat its customer what sour me about this hotel be that i book three room for my busines associate and me the front desk clerk advise me it would be cheap to book online and it do not matter what info i put as we be stand right in front of him on a room for 3 people i put two Mind you the rate be exactly the same for 3 as two but when the front desk manager see it be for two he say the clerk be wrong and i would be charge an extra fee for the extra person i show him that the online rate be the same for 3 as 2 but he do nothing about it i assure him i would not return to his property and neither would any of my employee i have be stay in this property for 6 year the staff the food and the room have be outstanding the front desk manager Sheela expmlifie the hotel and its philosophy she have go out of her way to make my stay very pleasant and comfortable she treat me like a

it be out of choice that i select Fortune Select Trinity FST for my office trip to Bangalore but i be so glad to have come across this gem be a part of ITC group of hotel FST completely live up to their expectation i have make a goof up while booking i have book for previous night instead of the one i be go to stay they graciously overlook my mistake and do not charge me for the night not only that they upgrade me to the Suite Needless to say i be one happy patron come to food it be quite delicious both dinner and breakfast both the time the spread be large and yummy enough to make you want to overeat in the morning while checkout i meet with the lady manager could n t catch her name but she be so nice and helpful with the complete checkout proces i wish i have some time to stay a little longer Shall definitely choose FST for my future visit as well Excellent stay all the comfort require for Business Hotel with equally warm service Special mention for Mr Nityanand Patil who have a knack of ensure to give you what you nee at all the time and be available 24 7 the hotel staff be very courteous and ready to help which be a very positive Fantastic in room dining option which be cater by the chef specially base on your need overall a very pleasant stay and experience this be my second stay at this facility both time i stay for a week while on a busines trip what i like the room full sized window spacious well light comfortable bed and delicious food Last time i have an isolated incident which i have review earlier but i do n t want that to restrict me from stay at this place because of all the above mention benefit what strike me most be the inconsistency in experience even though my visit be just 3 month apart this time there be no bathrobe the bathtub be n t clean and the number of towel keep decrease with each day s housekeeping the room service be on time and most of their item be delicious Only irritating factor be when they put an urgency in clear the tray for instance i be serve my food at around 9 PM and at 9 20 i get a call ask me if they could clear the tray I say no and 10 minute later someone be knock on the door ask if they could clear the plate i find it funny but also slightly irritating Overall this be a nice facility provide some more consistency in the guest experience would be great Most of the time a guest may book the same hotel to get the same experience if they be happy the first time Decent hotel in this area Breakfast be all right and wifi speed be good mine break down and they can only manage to get me to connect to guest wifi which be much slow of course Check out the shop at lobby for some Indian souvenir Easy to get ub to commute to anywhere visit Fortune Whitefield after so many year and surprisingly nothing have change Same well maintain room and quick service make this one of my favorite hotel for the busines trip Location be the USP for this hotel especially if you have meeting in and around whitefield area Tips for improvement the front desk do not consider my request for extended check out even though the room be available the extended check out time should be flexible especially for the Club ITC member also the wifi system be not very authentic as i struggle for 1 hour to get it sort out i book the Fortune Hotel for week for a company training the service be great and the staff be the good part i stay at many hotel but never experience such great support form the manager shamraj and be team i would highly recommend for company training and oth event i have be here for a 30 member corporate dinner party the banquet hall be quite good enough for the crowd and clean except that AC be not work properly the disappointment be on the service part especially the bartender it be obvious that he do n t know how to make drink and make the customer feel delighted wrong measurement wrong mixing rude attitude etc etc the bar be open only for for 90 min whereas usually it be 2 to 3 hour elsewhere the management and the bartender be argue over last minute drink just before closing bar which i never experience in a star hotel i be think about arrange a b day party here but the service i have see or receive have change my decision now May be the hotel and room be good but service what we expect from a star hotel be definitely missing the very first impression of the hotel be grand the room be clean and well stock with toiletry and oth amenity the staff be friendly and helpful the breakfast have ample option for vegetarian and non vegetarian i would like to specially mention the Guest relation manager Sheila Zachariah i be a little under the weather and she notice this she enquire about my health every day and show genuine concern the Hotel be very nice for busines stay as well as for traveler the staff be very nice and courteous and the food be very good the room be very comfortable and basic amenity for a stay be provide like an electric kettle toilet item i be on a busines trip to Bengaluru the Hotel room be well maintain the Hotel breakfast be really good it use to take an hour to to try all the item in the breakfast the Hotel staff service be really good they have a very good gym which be 24 7 they have a swimming pool too overall it be a great place to stay i stay in the hotel from 19th Jan to 21st Jan 17 the room be well maintain and be in a good location in Whitefield the hotel staff be very fast and helpful i have forget one of my ID proof at reception desk but they be prompt to return it to me i stay in fortune hotel from 11th February to 18th February 2017 overall i will say it be very pleasant and quite happy with the Amazing Service i have receive from all the hotel staff Breakfast be excellent and so as the dinner i ll recommend this hotel to all this be a first clas hotel with very good facility what make this hotel different be the STAFF the staff be unassuming but extremely helpful in particular Sheila front of house manager who be consistently helpful year on year very good service good staff good environment that we find abroad the food be excellent the room service be fast and good the lobby staff be always smile and helpful Should recommend to all very good experience at this hotel the room be spacious comfortable and clean for the price pay Service level be above expectation and staff be friendly Breakfast buffet spread be impressive with both western and Indian cuisine selection conveniently locate near many high tech company in Whitefield Bangalore have visit the hotel for a networking session it have beautiful lawn to cater to large crowd that awesome the food be great and the beautiful garden around there be quite a few IT company in the close proximity so it a great place for a team lunch or get together very professional staff good accomodation fair price for the location i will be stay here for now on when i be on Business in Bangalore Locationis in the heart of the IT district and about a 10 minute taxi ride from the good shopping center around i stay for 3 day in this hotel in the month of september 16 a very peaceful stay i must say do not like the breakfast much but in room dining be awesome and tasty especially kadhai paneer room be really nice pretty and spacious staff be also very decent Would recommend this hotel definitely Overall seem to be an old property locate at Whitefield area of Bangalore this hotel be conveniently locate near many office it have all modern amenity available include lawn gym pool 24 7 cafe stay for a night on work here and find this hotel to be above average as a busines hotel and quite efficient the room be clean well spec cd and spacious the bathroom need some bit of maintainance as the shower be spray all over overall it offer value i appreciate the generous packed breakfast for an early morning flight recommend for a stay at Whitefields i have stay there for few week last year between Nov 15 Mar 16 for busines trip overall the hotel be clean and staff be well behaved and soft spoken i have always enjoy my stay there but the restaurant in hotel be not so good they have very limited option of food and buffet be never good so i would recommend that one can stay there and have breakfast but never plan to have dinner in hotel after a hectic schedule and a nightmarish and infuriating travel experience we have from the w part of the city to this place we be glad that we choose the right place for lunch since it be weekday and a busines area the place be very peaceful and quite the ambience be splendid and well make the buffet have everything we aspire for a good lunch the staff be very pleasant and excellent the vegetarian menu have a wide variety and yummy Could not ask for anything more when we visit that part of the city again will surely visit the bar as well Thank you my stay be very nice and the staff be very friendly and Courteous small thing do matter and i ask for a pair of scissor and they readily send it to room which i return back later all in all a good stay friendly on the pocket for its value base budget pricing Breakfast be only two dish with egg item separate but never replenish in the serve dish Tea coffee wud be not hot Service personnel at breakfast be only one person that too with a grinning face too much rigid basi cost it not ok Clean well maintain place with a small gym and quite spacious room employee be very friendly and eag to help really enjoy my stay and feel very welcome and staff be very accomodating to any special request the property be very well maintain and be easily accessible the staff be also courteous and helpful consider the price it be a an awesome deal the room be spacious and well appoint while the overall stay be pretty good the only place of improvement would be the breakfast and the bed mattress the mattress feel a little too soft and crush for my liking oth than that it be fine well for starter the reception area and the so call lobby area can do with well lighting and ambience feel like walk in a detention camp at first sight the room be below average include the layout again get remind of detention camp the linen and the towel in particular be not clean i see a hello guest welcome to treebo card in my room which sort of list the vision for the hotel one of them be freshen up with our clean towel which i have already spell out indulge in branded toileterie be another there be nothing only handwash in a container with some crazy writing on it breakfast be another let down as there be only 2 option and i have to ask for the staple bread and butter there be egg though for the non vegetarians not much in term of choice for the traveller the bed also creak with the noise of spring which remind me of the old fashioned bed and be not a bit comfortable to sleep in i do give all this feedback at the front desk but i may as well be speak in Spanish as the lady just nod her head the property entrance be bang opposite to a garbage dump and you will see garbage compactor collect the same in the morning as you set out to work not the good sight to begin the day with all in all a very disappointing stay i have book two room Deluxe standard for a 3 night stay in Bengaluru this hotel be convinient to from the airport by way of the Vajra airport bu service Palace Guttahalli stop KIA 5 the hotel be more of a service apartment Hotel combo the stay be safe convinient the staff friendly my wife have misplace her watch at the hotel the reception be kind enough to call me even though i have check out to inform me about find the watch return it back to me Thank you Hotel staff Breakfast need attention as not much choice oth than Idli vada bread butter paratha fare on day when the hotel be full of guest the staff have a tough time mind request Wifi be slow irregular Most of the time i have to use my datum connection to do my work the property be in the heart of the city most busines place be nearby the hotel be clean room service be good overall it be worth recommend i wish the hotel mgmt give the right pin for location in the Google Maps as well as provide its front desk telephone number to the guest who have do advance booking i have a tough time get the telephone no which be not mention in the website Treebo site i be happy shall always return to Treebo Trend Orchard Suites Treebo Orchard suite be a good place to stay for a weekend trip the locality be pretty good and near to city center and also on the airport road Public transport may be a difficult to catch but have own vehicle or hire a cab would be ideal i like the service and hospitality look forward to check in at treebo on my next visit to Banglore as well the complimentary food in the morning exceed my expectation the gym be maintain with cleanlines Location room size be good Few thing like TV washroom need improvement Overall worth for money stay near to metro n easy to reach airport find the place be easy good staff n reception get it for a good price well within the city Washroom be pretty small need improvement book thru Yatra n be easy Breakfast need improvement Its a service apartment convert into hotel no fancy room only one thing good be hotel Staff Breakfast very limited option no valet parking Evening kitchen timing be 7 pm before that you will not get anything not even tea for a comfortable budget stay in Guttahalli Palace Orchards area in Bangalore choose the Treebo Orchard Suites a total value for money hotel extremely lavish on space have courteous staff and serve decent food too though they take a while to get dinner but i can ignore that since it be tasty Breakfast be good too but their room make you feel totally at home a total value for money option this be great value for money Polite staff decent food clean room and adequate supply like kettle soap etcWe check in about noon and leave the next day despite be in a rather busy part of the city the hotel be pretty quiet overall have a pleasant stay and even we extend the stay for one more day since we like it very much except for the first day there be some confusion on allot right room also some compliment be miss and after inform the staff thing be take care quickly Breakfast can be improve a bit we do n t like the breakfast on the first day but rest of the day it get well i stay here with my wife my brother and his wife it be a great location you can reach any place in Bangalore easily from here very clean place very friendly people Great gang Ajay Sunil Nasir Victoria Anthony and Rodney Great Tariffs be the icing on the cake my title say it all be here with family for 6 night just love the place for its unpretencious attitude it be as if i never leave my home room be large with balcony bathroom be good Breakfast be include be tasty abiet limited choice only compain be the property have not share the telephone number find it first time be little confusing Location be excellent as city centre be just less than half hour away Airport be also about 45 min ride Will definately stay here again Staff be very co operative and attentive kudo and keep up the good work it be a pleasant surprise to note their room be extra wide and spacious their staff particularly at the reception be awesome very friendly the one downside be the the poor maintenance of the restaurant and morning breakfast it lack cleanlines and very much short of personnel so i advise my fellow traveler not to eat the free breakfast offer by the hotel i will surely give them 4 star for every oth thing be good i stay there for three day and the staff be very co operative during the stay i have stay in ample room which be enough for a single person and regard the food its very good in term of quality and taste i love my stay at Treebo Orchard Suites it be a good expereince it be peaceful stay service and facility be good cleanlines little use of plastic environment freindly rule no smoking in room all these be good Staff be friendly i would like to draw attention that few thing would take time to get fix like Broken Treadmill in the Gym Complementary breakfast be good Staff could improve their quality of attention and dilligence for cleanlines around which nevertheless be on the average good though have stay at this hotel since 2015 when it be in a good standard stay here in 2017 in room 406 and have report that the geyser be not work forward to 2018 the geyser be still malfunction with no hot water this time before move to room 406 be give a different room again Ac be not function in that room seem like Management do nothing to rectify these issue follow guest report and be interested in only make money room be spacious and that the only plus but they be old and tired now need refurbishment their Wifi be a joke Complimentary breakfast be average with the dish take long break to get top up probably to dissuade guest eat more Laundry staff member keep hassle us for tip and conveniently make way with any tip leave for house keep staff Beware to count your laundry properly as we have an expensive tshirt miss unless this hotel be refurbish it could be worth avoid toilet and bathroom very old and not maintain Breakfast be basic and south Indian cuisine not to international standard we reach the hotel at around 6 be be only able to get to our room by 8 am room be mediocre and old Geyser need to be manually switch on it be a budget hotel Carry your own bedding if possible Hotel bedding not too clean we be a couple but be give 2 single bed Staff be polite but service sub standard Excellent staff cozy room lot of greenery very calm peaceful hotel Proximity to main busines district overall a nice place to stay with breakfast at such an economic tarrif be marvelous i will definitely want to visit again the overall experience here be great and have a very good time the hotel be maintain very well Special mention of the breakfast the breakfast be very nice and be arrange extremely well Staff be very good Good Room service and breakfast but lunch and dinner be costly at the hotel Good staff and also they help in take the luggage also Deluxe room be spacious but there be no Kitchen Facility Common place for dining for the standard room be good first the positive friendly extremely helpful staff Polite and very refreshing that they do n t hang around for tip Booking proces quick and uncomplicated and at least the toilet be very clean now for the bad new photograph of room very misleading the ground floor room be very small stuffy the day we check in i find bloodstain yes blood stain on the duvet cover and one pillow so do n t think they change the sheet after every guest or do a close check on the linen and towel how do a hotel without a restaurant get a 4 star rating and how about mention no restaurant on the website as for breakfast ratio of water to milk be 3 1 so do n t go for the cornflake and if you be not early enough you can be sure that the fresh juice have be water Imagine a hotel in South India serve lousy coffee Watery i have have strong Nescafe in roadside cafe staff nee to be train not to set out wet plate and mug lastly folk i be certain that rooftop kitchen would not pas a hygiene health inspection this be a good hotel locate near to Guttahalli palace bu stop Nice breakfast wlth change menu every day Good Staff excellent service one suggestion be to ensure at least one chair in every room for convenience of guest i have stay here before it be take over by Treebo the place be show its age price have go up but room size have come down Breakfast be the highlight as be the clean staff and cook we have book adjacent room with kitchenette and we do not get them adjacent we be give all sort of story about why this be so none believable it also require many overseas telephone conversation before the reservation could be sort out in the first place excellent hospitality really enjoy the trip with treebo hotel hotel atmosphere be excellence the this hotel situate at the main area of bangalore thank to treebo service the rate be very reasonable a good hotel provide very spacious room to stay Breakfast be good Bed be comfortable Only issue be bathroom where cold water be a problem in wash basin and hot water be a problem in shower they should attend to these before allot room otherwise a good location and a value for money hotel the place be more like service apartment Good enough to stay if you be not expect luxury basic be in place a little bit more on the maint part could have get this place 5 mark one of the good thing be the private sit out in case u book 2 room Value for money Simple and nice hotel the entrance be not very visible but there be a sign board outside Early morning prayer from a mosque can be hear sometimes Nice Indian breakfast the staff be kind and hospitality be good i have a small mix up in my reservation check in timing have to pay full day tarif for arrive 8 hour earlier maybe a Half day tarif would have be reasonable or a complimentary gesture since we have 2 room for 6 day stay would have be well centrally locate closer to malleswaram cool calm ambience just like residential place but comfortable Restaurant offer decent breakfast though not expansive range but 2 dish of good quality timing of room service could have be all thru the day first of all thank to Treebo hotel for accommodate my request for reschedule at no extra cost that too at 11th hour the hotel be at a decent location with good road connectivity the room be comfortable however the geyser be non functional in my room the basin tap too be leak Staff be helpful Regards Anupam we book treeno online and then pay the amount plus extra bed for extra person charge and still after that he ask us to pay more 400 as he say we do we should ne informed about the extra payment before and why should we do that when its not part of booking if its part why isnt it inform before Poor quality room not a three star hotel sheet be filthy not a suite as claim Poor hygiene in dining area and poor quality of breakfast Will not recommend if you like clean room it be not as claim to be Do n t go by the picture room s toilet be smell toilet be not sanitized location of the hotel be good it be well to take hotel at third or fourth floor Avoid take stay at ground floor rooms breakfast and service of the room be very good staff be support Average i have Vvvv bad experience be first time to seem from trerbo hotel while be travel i prefer treebo as first chooice which i be experience many treebo hotel but this time be disappoint Location be good but breakfast be not upto the mark i ask for boil egg the staff say that we do n t have egg if they do n t have egg then why there be egg to be order space in the breakfast area room be clean but there be no dentle kit i book double room for 3 day room be spacious and clean the surround be calm and quite the staff be very good and polite the breakfast be simple could have provide more option the overall experience be good the parking space be spacious conveniently locate on airport road so it be very easy to reach the property by Airport bu which have a stop opp this Hotel Breakfast be always good and also have option for food joint nearby Staff be also well behaved in all a good property to stay im take the time to write this review as i would like to reach to whoever be in the top to expres my disappointment regard quality of service the internal process i book the hotel for a long stay guest through my company and while make the reservation i clearly tell that this be a long stay corporate account and the bill will be settle only at the time of check out a guy call Sparsh although go out of his way to get me good possible rate agree to this arrangement a week later due to unavailablity of room my guest have to checkout for a day into another nearby Treebo hotel i be ask to make payment i tell them the guest be check back in the next day and the agreement be that the payment would be make at the end of the stay the guy in the reception make the guest wait for 2 hour in the lobby and threaten not to let the guest go with out the payment although corporate account i have to make the payment from my personal debit card in order not to inconvenience my guest the caller who seem like receptionist be rude and impolite and very insensitive to the fact that i be in the middle of shift house there be no apology or remorse later i request for a bill and invoice for the payment make which i do not receive yet and hope i would receive some time by the end of my guest stay our guest be continue to stay there and i have be constantly receive call for payment sometimes as late as 11 00 at night state that we be cause los of revenue to the hotel because we have not make the payment i have explain the situation to several people and they promise to make note in the system and never call again each time im be tell that the system do not accept the stay beyond 15 day and after every 15 day i have to make payment to check out and recheck in the guest into the system i m surprise that with an organisation such as this there be no system and process in place for a long stay guest my guest be even tell that if the payment be not make we will have to take the payment from you despite say that no payment shall be ask from the guest because it be a corporate account be this what you call customer service the staff be discourteous there be no guest centricity and the internal communication system and proces suck Treebo not only never deliver what be promise but also be a huge shame to hospitality customer service room with bathroom be clean and well lighten up Breakfast be good with 2 3 option all 3 day could n t use Wifi for more than 10min it just for namesake seriously improve on wifi facillity they offer locker facility Perfect stay nice ambience good food nice location Easy acces to city July be the good month for the travelle nice room nice staff treebo hotel be always good for stay at any location Good Hotel and neat and clean room Staff be co operative and most important be that Food be good only one confusion happen while i cam from Mysore to Banglore Bus Stand there be two place in Adress a Treebo place be Guthali and another near Bus Stand that be Uthali so while cache auto or bu please first confirm exact wording Its like a service apartment which provide all the facility for short or long stay since its like a service apartment you get the opportunity to order food from outside if one feel like the hotel be in a nice locality and the staff be very helpful all in all a good choice for stay in Bangalore accord to the rate we request for early check in but be n t consider when give room we be n t inform as to where to find water since the bottle water we have be over the rest of the night we be in thirst for a family you should provide one double cot but our be two single cot so little inconvenient the breakfast be good and the waiter in the dinning hall be very friendly Rest of the thing be so good Parking facility be so nice Location be good Staff very friendly and very help full thoroughly enjoyable stay for four day special thank to manager Rodney who go out of his way to help us will come back again thank to all the staff who make our stay very relaxing it be nice to stay at Treebo Orchad Suites everything be fine Service be very good Staff be very cooperative Breakfast be good i like the gym of hotel very much though nearby area of the hotel be not so good but that be not effect hotel s environment overall it be pleasant stay in this hotel quite an impolite front office staff not even look at the customer while speak to them very few electrical plug point in the room Most of these plug point be break or non operational i have to stay another day but choose to stay in a different hotel Let me be hon room and reception staff be really good but Breakfast have only variety Upma and Aloo paratha both be in very bad taste and over spicy probably it be spicy so that no 1 eat much however in any south Indian hotel idly vada and Dosa be basic breakfast which be not serve also tea and coffee be over when i ask for same the staff be rude and say its over mind breakfast time be 7 10am and at 8 05 AM breakfast be over very poor no value for money as pay really high consider good breakfast there oth hotel without break at much low price i have stay in this hotel for couple of day get a very well maintain clean and spacious room at throw away price Staff be well mannered and the room service be prompt and efficient the good part be the location it be centrally locate very close to Mantri Square Mall and Bangalore Palace and easily accessible from all part of Bangalore yet withdraw in a quite green location they have facility like Gym Car Parking Laundry and Restaurant overall a very comfortable stay and value for money it a convenient place in Bangalore Center easy reach the hospitality be very good nice staff with good advise specially front desk the room be spacious and value for money be guarantee nee room service as no day long hotel facility which cause bit inconvineance i stay 3 night and it be very nice for the price the breakfast be good and i have a bottle of water in my room the check in be quick and i found a straight bu from the airport to the hotel i think it be a good idea if the hotel say that to their guest there be a gap under the door which let the light go in the room and the noise the room be spacious and clean i recommand this hotel we make a short trip to Bangalore and opt to stay at Treebo Orchards Suites near Guttahalli Circle the place be a close to Cantonment station and the check in at the reception be quick we be offer complimentary water bottle and breakfast the room be neat spacious and airy Lenin s and bed spread be clean the breakfast spread be adequate nutritious and tasty overall an enjoyable stay at Treebo Orchard our wedding guest have an excellent time at Orchard Suites very cooperative and helpful staff Spacious and Clean room conveniently locate we take 30 room at the property and all our guest be equally delighted to put thing in perspective that this be accomplish on Dec 30 31 which be indeed peak time for the hotel talk volume about their service quality Rodney and team a big thank for make it such a fruitful experience it be a wonderful experience to stay in this hotel which give me a feel at home ambiance it worth for my money as i get all facility include a high tech gym the staff be highly cooperative and excellent in service Keep it up visit this property for a couple of day the property have suite mostly with 2 room per suite the kind of service well maintain room and property amazing food definitely be a surprise at just Rs 1600 night i would definitely recommend this to anyone travel to Bangalore and prefer to stay near this area the hotel have a good location and be almost 15 min 20 min away from WTC Rajaji Nagar Malleswaram West they have a car parking too just in case you plan to get your car overall i would give 10 10 on all parameter to this and would love to come here again for the price it be definitely a steal you get not a room but a 2 room flat with Kitchen huge living room with balcony although the state of the outside wall negate spend time there the cleanlines maintain be on par with 3 star hotel this do not have restaurant attach but be locate near so many eatrie you do n t nee one Most of the nearby restaurant deliver the food with discount if you state that you be stay in this hotel Treebo Orchard Suites be locate in a quiet residential area and offer peaceful and comfortable stay the room be spacious and well appoint with good wi fi connectivity the staff be helpful and very co operative Breakfast be tasty but somewhat limited in term of option as there be not much to choose from in case you be plan to also get some dinner they do have restaurant and room service available up to 9 pm once again not too many option available for vegetarian who would want to have a light dinner they also provide menu of restaurant nearby from where food can be order however these place close by 8 30 9 pm a great location but this hotel be not too ideal for Business as i soon realise the room be extremely spacious and comfortable there be a living room with a stove and microwave unfortunately be disappoint by their service they only serve food from 7 10 pm and have a strict rule not allow food from outside to be deliver i be tired and reach the hotel at 5 pm and would have love a room deliver meal instead since the hotel have only coffee available i have to leave and go to a nearby place to eat like oth Treebo facility this one too live up to expectation with clean linen and clean surrounding a little over a km from Bangalore Palace main entrance this hotel be also just a km over from Satvam too Breakfast spread superior to oth Treebos Keep it up only downside the bathroom could use some upkeep floor tile and shower screen not as good as at oth Treebos if u be a couple even if married carry ur marriage certificate just in case cause the place be strictly against couple the second criterion for rejection be if u have a Bangalore ID card they will not provide u accomodation i teach that people from bengaluru be very friendly and accommodate for some reason Treebo Orchard Suites think otherwise Staff have to change their attitude cause this be not a charitable institution it be early SILVERSTAR booking but due to maintenance issue TREEBO have take urgent step give ORCHID SUITE one step up Standard Room Great quick Customer Satisfaction response recd i recommend to go experience once at Banglore with TREEBO i really enjoy my night at Treebo the team be incredibly helpful and i feel safe and secure the room be very comfortable with ac fab and safe and a comfy bed Breakfast in the upstairs balcony be delicious too Best Hotel that feel like home Ideal for long stay or for few day i stay for almost 2 month good value for money very polite and helpful staff spaciou an clean room with ventilation small gym complimentary breakfast and wifi a selection of room be available and i stay in the Maple category which have a separate kitchen separate dining and living area with a separate bed room a mix between a hotel and apartment hence it feel like home the staff an management take care of me and attend to all my need on request finally i have find my permanent hotel when i travel on work to Bangalore Keep up the good work the room be nice and homely and the staff be very friendly professional and helpful enjoy my stay the one thing i be not very happy about be the internet speed but i gues that be something that could be improve upon Location be convenient an apartment be convert into this hotel the room be very big and comfortable have a problem with water clog in the bathroom and it be immedietly rectify the room service be quick and they serve smile Good variety in the Breakfast fast Checking and Checkout ignore the front desk staff they look us as if why do we come to this hotel and do not help us carry our luggage to the room i have to carry 4 luggage and my daughter from front desk to the room we have an awesome stay i feel at home when i spend 4 day at Treebo Orchard Suites my room be spacious and have a homely feeling the staff be very responsive good hotel i ever stay at till now good value for money room be excellent big enough neat and clean staff be good and cooperative improvement on toilet ventilation and cleaning in toilet to be improve during AC on the floor get wet and odour in the room if this be improve then this hotel be 100 perfect and hygeine i be greet at the reception very politely and a welcome manner Inwas explain all the facility available include how to start the free wifi breakfast timing restaurant service etc Great service Worth for the money Spacious Deluxe Rooms some have even Kitchens Good break fast and Dinner i feel food be very tasty and prepare well i advise them to go for a bit on interior beautification with paint or wallpaper door bell and appropriate furniture and new spring bed Service be good Staff good Make it non smoking Everything be fine and perfect Reception staff be so supportive Mr Antony from room service be very good and he help us to arrange cooking utensil and stuff a well mannered man with extra charisma he do everything without any hesitation the capacity of the room be 4 member only it be small than the pic show in this website but the stay here will be pretty comfortable and the service here be also good best in clas Hotel in Bangalore only they do nt serve lunch and little delay in service but belive me its just little room be very big spacious beautiful its service apartment not hotel no bar in hotel but they will not stop you to bre the room allot be small than the one publish in the website prior to my booking i be confirm that i would be provide the same room however on the next day i become aware that the room adjoin to my room be to one promise to me but not allot to me the receptionist be unable to explain the reason but insist that the room size be the same i be a Civil Engineer can easily distinguish between the two room however i be disappoint with the attitude of the staff Treebo orchard suite be a neat and comfortable stay with kitchen amenity such as microwave fridge plate and cutlery available in the room the room be sufficiently furnish with a small hall and dining hall the placecan be locate easily with your google map we stay for 3 day in premium room its excellent stay to compare all our trip its very near to all your need all staff be very polite and very helpful except kitchen staff even they serve water to us at breakfast time in 3 day the hotel be locate near palace ground and the hotel feel like your at home very comfy room its kind of apartment stay rather call it hotel Book a room enjoy your stay just like you stay in your house firstly they show a smelly room after deny they give us lil well room on second floor how can we choose nxt time treebo i be with my family and parents they see the room and upset first time be my good experience this time it take me down bcz i tell to my parent that treebo have good property plz take this matter seriously Good Service Clean room and good breakfast Good staff and good location to stay with connectivity to airport road and oth place nearby if you be search for Budget hotel this one be good option for Family as well as friend include breakfast be very poor barely enough range but quality be very poor Room be reasonable clean nothing to complain but room furniture etc could do with a renovation replacement Reception house keep be OK for a couple of issue that we have the room be really small compare to what be show in the picture the balcony feature be nice the breakfast be not breakfast with just two option its a old property which need renovation urgently the staff be friendly and nice leak wash basin Key lock be 70 s style minimal breakfast ideally for a quick overnight ask for a non smoking floor n get a smoking room Ask for high floor to reach the BF table as seat be limit room be good and specious in the second category room segment the only issue be the window which be face to oth apartment and other can see if the curtain be open oth wise we have a comfortable stay and the staff be very cooperative Good place for quite family holiday and for busines traveler near to Bangalore Palace and Vidhana Soudha Good for cleanlines and service but no car parking and food availability only during breakfast the room be really well maintain but be 3 adult and we want an extra bed which be promise at the time of booking i speak to people from central call center but to our shock the receptionist deny allow extra person and we be ask to call the call center and upgrade to the premium room this whole thing take about half an hour oth than this everything else be just perfect we stay two night in Treebo Orchard Suites we be a group of 4 with two young child we have book a simple double room Oak and a Mahagony 2 bedroom with 2 single bed each a live cum dining room a kitchen and a balcony the KITCHEN be n t very well furnished there be a fridge a microwave and a kettle but very few utensil to cook no knife no peeler no pan etc so apart form cha and eventually noodle you ca n t cook your own food you have book a with the idea that we would cook especially for the child but it prove a bit complicated moreover the restaurant open only in the morning from 7 am to 10 be and in the night from 7 pm to 10 pm so in between if you nee something you have to manage by yourself we arrive in the afternoon by the Shatabdi from Mysore and we think that once arrive at the hotel we could order some snack and cha but that be n t the case and as it be situate in a residential area there be n t many restaurant around the CLEANLINESS of the room be ok without be impressive overall it need a bit of refurbishing the SERVICE be fine but the management could be well my mother have a Swiss passport and be a French resident she give an addres in France they make all a fus about it not understand how it be possible insist on her give her Swiss addres and the matter could only be resolve after she give an old addres non valid since 2005 that have not be an issue in any of the oth hotel we check in during our trip during our stay they shift from an open network to a protect one and after that the INTERNET CONNECTION be awful to end with a positive point the food be simple but very tasty Short trip to Bangalore and my daughter have book this place again Good clean place with all the basic Good service and staff and decent budget place for a few night room come with breakfast which be basic but sufficient Dinner be to order good stuff and generous serving very decently price no complaint and recommend for family and busines for a short stay Affordable clean room with a decent breakfast location also be great staff very friendly overall a comfortable stay thing to improve light in the room can me better and not much of eat option outside in a walkable distance Will certainly visit again not enough Drinking water be not supply only 1ltr per day per room that too not on day of check out and customer be force to buy a bisleri water bottle with MRP of Rs 20 for r 35 WiFi neither smooth nor fast Good side be that room be clean surprisingly they claim to have 250 hotel across 30 city however the management be horrible be an entrepreneur myself and would not like to tarnish the image of any place that quick as i understand the kind of hard work that go in build a brand however since it a service base industry guest would like to review the property base on service more then just the look the place be decent neat but the staff be just not cooperative in fact rude we be 2 woman check in exhausted 12 30 at night be almost harass for payment in spite of pay online for 1 night they want us to go back to the reception from the room allot at 1a m in the morning and pay them for the entire stay then there else would not send the luggage to the room which i find be extremely rude impolite 2nd the breakfast everyday be very basic apparently close by 10 a m now the good part if there be more guest apparently it seem they do n t bother to increase the quantity of the b f as per the no of guest coz twice they just say it all over by 9 40 we be just give bread egg anyways people may have their view opinion since we travel at least 3 4 time a month Pan India for exhibition the service be base on comparison with oth hotel stay in the 2 BHK suite Mahagony for 2 night with my family 1 AC in 1 bedroom never work inspite of all complaint and repair trial 2 cleanlines of floor be average 3 Quality taste of Food not upto mark Breakfast be just name sake no choice 4 Service level very slow you ask for anything nee minimum 2 reminder Room be find clean curtain be also clean but colour be fade up Toilet be clean but below wash basin mirror Electrical Socket Box not fix properly Door mat be miss neither room entrance nor toilet entrance Wall mount TV instal just below the Split AC which may unsafe to drop water in the TV during any teething trouble inside Wooden Wardrobe be apparently clean but nee polishing painting for betterment Shoe shine wax paper be also miss Availability of Chair be also require inside the room some sort of luggage keep Table be feel to be require in the room besides wall mount painting for well out look staff be good Fooding be good but costly Mineral water of 1 light bottle be cost r 35 be unexpectedly high OVERALL HOTEL be GOOD allow us 2 hr extra check out time stay Services be also good WIFI SYSTEM be very BAD very SLOW nee to BE look after immediately Good aesthetic Place very Predictable place very responsive Reception Spacious Living Space Good Breakfast Value for Money place little away from crowd more like a residential environ Distractions inside room not Insufficient furniture want to eat something inside Room difficult Restaurant Food just average at time not serve on time this be a very good hotel to stay room be very clean and service be fine Breakfast be very good and daily they provide different thing to eat i give 4 point because of one thing that they ask advanced full payment and i think nowhere any one take full payment in advance very clean room good for buisnes trip they give buffet breakfast which be very delicious include one southindian item one north indian paratha or chhole omlet or fry breadbutter tea coffee fresh juice very peaceful area near hotel Hotel be locate in city center Great Value in nearly all direction good southindian Breakfast Buffet change daily accord to Roomprice more than we ever expect no high performance of Presentation in the Breakfast Room at third floor open Veranda be just lovely and moody it be easy and typical indian and that good for Nonindians please do try this 3 different dish and you will have a good start with some nice cup of chai in the day we already miss it beee back home lovely fresh curry leave as usual for southindianfood great omelette as you wish to order the Premiumroom 203 we book be huge superclean floor big double bed just Wow kitchen with icecold superclean Refrigerator and big showerroom Go for it only towel should be better wash in some case really bad smell sorry to say that it be a mustbe for Treebo to install high Performance Wlan work in really all room because it always change finally we have be very happy feel very good and thank to the nice Crewmembers always with a smile Day and Night Hope to come back one day to Bengaluru and 100 sure to go to Orchard Suites again the hotel be appropriate for a brief stay of two night but not more than that all basic amenity be available staff be excellent but they do not have car service the bad thing be their wifi which be extremely hopeless all in all IT be a DECENT STAY nice room location homely feeling cooperative staff decent food great crowd value for money i would like to stay again in future if need to and this minimum 200 word review be really irritating Avg hotel with great location Pocket friendly nee to describe the detail of the room as they have two option for room which be difficult to judge with the name Bw careful while book the same if you be look for home away from home then undoubtedly you should look into this place Quality be the watch word Good break fast Spacious Gym very pleasant atmosphere and courteous staff with regard to discount they scan be still more reasonable they celebrate 2nd Anniversay and offer 20 usual discount plus 25 Cash Back discount for online cutomer we be offer only usual discount and no cash back discount be give to us Overall great place to stay i stay here 10 day the staff here be very help even i get to know the name of the people work there Sunil Kumar Viresh Antony all staff Nice clean place close to Guttahalli Circle in Sheshadripuram Bangalore Breakfast provide and free WiFi till stay i have book thirty room between 01 to 05 Jun 2017 for accomodate family guest for a marriage ideally locate close to Palace Grounds the place be a small property with adequate facility it provide value for money the room be well keep and be attend to every day Most kichenette be not use hence the facility for use them be not adequate Provision of gas stove plus a few utensil will help guest stay for long period the restaurant need upliftment the area where breakfast be serve be in a disarray after the initial use by guest ant be see near the tea coffee counter the staff be excellent they be courteous and often go out of way to be helpful the booking be do with their marketing team by email and call the hotel per say have no jurisdiction to change or alter as per client request this be a handicap at time when alteration to the original booking be ask for overall a good experience consider that so many guest be to be look after arrive and depart at different time the GM personally intervene many time to plan menu and sort out minor issue i find the hotel to be an awesome one the staff s interaction be really good cleanlines hygiene be up to the mark Food taste and variety can be well though they be good overall my experience with the hotel be excellent i stay with my family for 3 night and experience be not much pleasant it an old service apartment convert to hotel except location nothing worth mention Stay only if travel alone i stay at Treebo Orchrad Suites Bengaluru from 14th to 15th May in the top floor two room with my family the hotel be little old but very well maintain the room be huge the breakfast be good with live dosa and paratha make in house the staff behavior and attitude be excellent Treebo hotel be the good to stay at when your on any kind of trip Service quality complimentary breakfast the room all be at the good quality i would always recommend treebo for a pleasant stay good service and helpful staff Good food and breakfast very neat and clean room good location near market everything be good i be happy for Treebo orchard service Booking be very simple i enjoy my trip Good room worth Money Complimentary breakfast be Nice staff be very good People who plan to stay long can go for a room with Kitchen which be equip with gas stove microwave and fridge Rooms be neat and tidy with clean bed linen your room be clean and the suite be very spacious the stuff be very helpful the hotel lay very central i miss nothing the include breakfast be more than enough to start the day i can only recommend this place especially for family or group room be very clean and spacious Check in and check out be hassle free the staff be very friendly Decent complimentary breakfast Worth the price totally Would certainly recommend people this property in Bangalore Decent Property well maintain locate in a very calm place Have get ample parking space Breakfast spread be quite good but could be improve stay here for two day it a customer friendly place overall i like this place and definitely will look forward to stay here again this be not a hotel room as the name indicate it be a small suite there be an out room or sofa room with a kitchenette attach an inn bedroom with an adjoining combined bath loo we find everything we require for a short stay it be not luxurious but it be very adequate there be very good complimentary breakfast Newspaper every morning the kitchenette have a microwave a gas stove few basic utensil and a kettle Basic tea thing be there one can order lunch or dinner which be good though i find it a litlle costly but maybe justifiable in view of small scale and convenience the drawback that we find be the illumination be very low except in the bath only low watt bulb and the door cupboard handle and edge and swiitche be grimy maybe that be why the light be low i be tell the standard room which be give would be one of the good room however the bathroom shower be rusted and when the tap be open red color of rust flow with water also in breakfast while have poori i get an fry ant in it which look pathetic the location be very crowded though they claim that they have parking facility you ca n t park your peacefully as it be very narrow i could n t get a cup of coffee or tea in the evening as there be no one in the kitchen i be told my 4 day of stay the linen remain the same and it be barely clean every time i travel to Bangalore my first preference be treebo good place to stay very spacious room and easy to locate Have ample car parking and go place from there be easy Feel at home very neatly maintain room and premise i be very glad top find this hotel we be two and i be in Bangalore to speak at a conference and the last day find out that conference organizer be there as well i choose the large double so two separate bedroom with large kitchen area and small balcony off the live area the entire staff be helpful and we find the hotel clean and pleasant not in a fine area of the city but very easy to get everywhere Positive 3 device for the wi fi Negative in and out connection and not very rapid Breakfast include but very limit nit very tasty though the omelette and french toast as alternative be on order and good the people be good the place be decent overall Thr room be nice it be n t like the oth Treebo Hotels it be an old govt guest house convert and it show the place be smelly in the lobby and general area however the room be nice clean and fresh Bed sheet and bed cushion be poor and they give me the top room which use to get too heated and AC be not work no comfort if you have travel and try to catch some sleep before next endeavor they have very little option in breakfast have pleasant stay beautiful room calm environment good for all sort of traveller room be specious and economical price ideal for family staff also good room contain leave area furnish with dining table sofa our room be spacious with the attach gallery washroom be very clean the complimentary breakfast offer in the hotel be a buffet style and have a lot of variety Front desk staff be very help one drawback be they do n t have good in house food it be decent but there be well option in nearby restaurant overall room be gud staff be friendly location be pretty good there be direct connectivity to airport no hop or change mode of transport room be worth the price i give food be good but still there be scope for improvement of food will definitely recommend to my friend n family Check in be quick Clean room their complimentary breakfast be good with limited choice they do n t have lunch but serve dinner there be 2 restaurant nearby Hotel Nandhini Northwind for home delivery for dine out do try Pulimunchi 6min Autorickshaw we stay in Deluxe room which have an oven fridge on request they provide you plate even an Iron Box Courteous polite staff only negative to point out be that the bed be very sink in on the side close to door i understand it be because that the most use side they could rotate or change mattres Clean and spacious room Could not get WIFI service during the entire length of my stay the dining room and kitchen need to be really clean the food though limit in choice be however tasty Lift get stick once during my stay this service apartment be locate in a residential area of Seshadripuram the room be neat and clean and the hospitality be appreciate Good food at the in house restaurant the hotel be well connect to the airport some Good thing can be spoil by some unpleasant staff and their attitude and behaviour can mean the difference between 5 star and 3 star or even less i have see review on many hotel where the customer complain of staff behavior and i wonder why these hotel still continue with these staff when they can get bad review online and lose busines be it really worth it this be the second Treebo Hotel that i be stay in i book Treebo because they have really economical hotel with fairly good room 3 star hotel clas and a decent breakfast and since they be all over the city you can choose the one near to where you have busines or your prefered location so this time we want to be close to cantonment and also want large room base on review i go with Treebo Orchard Suites Booking be do via Makemytrip and Treebo directly as we need 8 room with 17 people stay Good deal with less than 2k per room Booking be smooth and no issue during check in Rooms be really spacious with lot of additional space live room as this be an apartment block convert to a hotel i be post photo for a well idea of the room each room be different from the oth but all fairly large bathroom may not be spic and span but have lot of space and not much to complain about just that some people may want 3star clas of bathroom there be a small gym for those who want to work out in the 4th floor around 4 to 5 car can be park in their parking lot now the negative be the following the complimentary breakfast be mediocre and have very few choice just idli bread rava kesari etc and egg to order the early treebo hotel have choise of dosa poori and idli and the rest of the stuff mention above and the real bummer be the day we be check out it be a sunday and we have to go out and would be back only by 11 am we need time till twelve to check out but when we request at the reception we be tell that we have to check out by 11 be itself as they have oth guest come they have around 40 room but occupancy be only 30 and there be free room but we do not argue however at around 11 be we get a call from the lady at the front desk say there be guest wait to check in and we have to check out as we be outside we hurriedly return to the hotel to find that there be nobody wait to check in we be 100 sure that there be no guest check in at that time room be big and spacious with good bed Shower be good bathroom be clean Staff be efficient Location be quiet and close to airport surround have nothing much some basic shop and cafe Staff can help to call ub cab we stay in one of your premium double room it be like a service apartment very neat and clean and staff be very polite attend as soon as approach Buffet breakfast be also very good contain all type of variety from south indian to north indian type contain continental also with this room there be also cook medium like four burner gas and microoven in the kitchen also Excellwent Feel very homely People like Leslie Manju and Anthony be wonderful and very helpful Do not want to stay anywhere else Central location Clean i have recommend this to many of my friend in USA visit Bangalore and they all love it Keep up the good work Love to come back in August i personally like Dosa to be include in the breakfast menu i be a little disappointed this time when i ask for Dosa and they say it be not available this be a service apartment property get convert to Hotel Few base on the type of room you book you will get different type of room during my trip i stay in two type of room Deluxe room and standard room Deluxe room be quite big with Fridge Microwave and coffee make facility Standard room be a small bit congested with two bed Common Halls be big and neat but management need to make sure they do n t store old mattress which be bit eyesore further the furniture be old and look to me as they buy from a secondhand market and there be no design or colour coordination Breakfast be poor after 2 day i start take breakfast from a nearby restaurant Staff member be friendly and they really treat you with lot warmth and affection Good stay and well manage Staff of the hotel be excellent room be clean and enough room space for couple

extremely limited Food option be also not great the room be clean and comfortable Overall hotel area be also nice though the location be little off the main road one can easily get Ola Uber cab the hotel be good if somebody be look to spend the night near Bengaluru airport without spend too much in travel the place be clean Staff be somewhat clumsy instruction be not clearly follow and there be delay in response action Bath could have be much well than what it be Food be okay Nothing great in all skip if you can especially if it be dark already as the approach road be bad the Bathroom smell horrible the shower be very bad the kind that the water splash to the side and never touch you the room service and restaurant service be terrible they never have the full menu every time i order something they tell me they do nt have that so i have to choose between their few option available the property be situate away from Bangalore city in a very quiet environment its less than 10 km from the airport very nice place for anyone seek to relax from daily hustle room be clean and spacious staff friendly especially the front office have a decent swimming pool and a magnificent lawn will have wonderful time child the only thing that lacking be a bar counter if they can make one soon it would be great altogether its worth stay there i really love that place and it be a relaxing

resort ANZ Bank Bengaluru away from the hustle and bustle of the city the resort be locate with beautiful serne atmosphere and conveniently very close to the airport the place be very spacious and the room be very neat and clean the staff be very courteous they have a variety of cusine but i think their tandoor be the good a true sample of excellent hospitality stay here for a day and a half room full of mosquito the lunch dinner place be too far room smell as though they have not be air ever and even with air conditioning the smell do not go the food be average and meeting room have uncomfortable chair be suitable for young people bring in by company for out bind training but i will not recommend this for for meeting and conference where people have to be indoor last but not the least place be litter with grown cat and their kitten and they be all over the place while i like cat but i dont like them dirty and in a hotel where i be stay give me reason to worry about hygiene and health safety of the place its near the airport and distant from the city and unless one have a compelling reason to choose this place i would not advise this place to any one this may be a good place for youngster who be think to party we find hotel as not more than a hostel no refrigerator in room Breakfast start at 8 am which be not correct for family especially with kid we have ask for tea as room service they tell us kitchen itself start at 7 30 am which annoy us even more they do not provide us tea until we reach the breakfast buffet and ya i do not like breakfast buffet too my opinion be it only for people who want to party late night with late morning schedule the only advantage for this resort be it near airport and people who go outside Bangalore can avoid city traffic Check out proces too clumsy wastage of time and very late start of breakfast at 8 am when half day be almost over Impolite duty staff at reception Bad door lock key not worthy to call as even 3 star Hope GM Mr Sahoo get our feedback today Ruupesh Chugh checkin 15th May 2018 and check out 16th May 2018 we visit for one night stay for weekend gateway the place be quiet room be clean Food be moderate not that great you should visit for spend some time away from city noise they have good indoor game as well stay here on the night of 21st Feb the original route be a 15 min drive from hotel but its undergo repair due to which you nee to come from the highway and the toll booth about 25 min there be no provision shop nearby so make sure you carry your stuff Cellphone signal too be weak we have come for an event here the property seem newly renovate with fresh paint Room size be decent if not huge give that its a resort do nt have a balcony either but good staff and fast be it the iron that i want or water at 6 am Shower be the not good though its fast but pressure be nt there can be well have dinner and breakfast good taste if not awesome but big lawn around include a kid area and a pool 4 5 star hope the short cut to the airport open up fast Good place nice location and great property Staff service and the room be good only drawback be not too many food option with limited menu and overly price item since this place be in the middle of now where they should be better equip Fiestaa be about 25 minute from the airport and whilst this be fully 1 1 2 hour from downtown Bengaluru by taxi it be convenient for transit to from the airport the location be a bit bizarre and it be in the middle of nowhere but at least that mean it be quiet and the surround round be quiet by Bangaluru standard it be worth note that we think we book a Garden Deluxe Room yet we do not have a view of the garden i query this with reception and they confirm with a wry smile that every room be a Garden Deluxe Room and we could indeed if we strain see a tiny patch of gras not from the garden the room be strictly non smoking but smell strongly of stale smoke and be quite tatty with peel on the cupboard and wall the room however be well clean every day the in house restaurant be very good and the garden and pool area be very nice but do n t expect to see it from the room Overall it be convenient for the airport not for Bengaluru itself and could do with a major renovation to bre it up to scale for a long term stay Good for one night for long or well acces to the City i d look elsewhere we just have the most fantastic wonderful and a special wedding at Fiestaa the calm ambience the cosy atmosphere be what strike us to consider have our daughters wedding at Fiestaa it be just the right location away from the city a 45 min drive from our home the greenery freshnes and cleanlines be the perfect place to create a memorable experience Food and bar service be excellent Siddharth the General Manager be extremely helpful very accommodative to all our need and requirement and be the key person in help make our event a memorable one even though we slightly over step on the timing Siddharth be so patient and understanding Thank you Siddharth their room be spacious and comfortable not forget the complimentary breakfast which be really good their friendly staff be attentive and helpful thank to the entire Fiestaa team for the wonderful service that day we have the most amazing day and our guest ca n t stop talk about it we be both absolutely delighted with how everything turn out i highly recommend Fiestaa for your wedding experience on that note a BIG THANK you and we look forward to return soon i stay here for a night with my family on a transit in Bangaluru we need to stay for a night in Bangaluru on our way to Chennai and this resort be just the place for that as it be very close to the airport it just take us approximately 20 minute to reach the resort from the airport the resort staff be very hospitable and check in be a breeze we have dinner at their open air restaurant and i should say the food be delicious and the same go for their breakfast Service be top notch and the room be also very clean the resort be in a village outside the city of Bangaluru so you would n t be affect by the city s pollution and chao its also not that far from the airport like 15 20 kilometer so if you want to transit in Bangaluru city then resort may just be the place the hotel employee be very nice and they will try their good to make you feel at home Full five star for fiestaa resort Excellent place to stay near airport its around 20 30 min from airport Route be kind of lonely during late night room be huge with lot of storage food be good Uber will work if timing be not odd Hotel can arrange cab if you nee drop of to airport but it will cost you twice that of Uber be here for a wedding recently and while the 4 acre property be quiet good it remote location make it troublesome while commute the service also be quite pathetic at time food in the buffet be not refill or be utterly cold Staff also have not be well trained and small request such a laundry bag be not attend to stay for a night here it be a wonderful place far from the city to relax and enjoy the free breakfast be yummy though the hotel staff be management trainee they be courteous Food be quite expensive and there be lot of fly during the daytime it close to the airport overall it a wonderful place to relax NIce place to stay during transit as it be very close to airport much cheap and comfortable than airport lounge if you nee to spend overnight to catch morning flight Clean room Friendly staff New property nice one but still lot to be improve i have face lot of problem its all occur due to lack of experience staff all the staff find as management trainee restaurant be situate outside with open area due to this lot of fly Pool area be good and lot of activity area available very slow internet stay for a night with my husband and infant boy We make a pit stop here and the drove off to nandi hill the hotel be decent and anyone require a hotel to stay near the airport can opt for it the food be especially delicious and the staff be friendly and polite over all not a bad stay at all stay here basi feedback from my sister who have a good stay few month bk Location away from hustle of city but peaceful and easy to locate with road signage room clean and well maintain have a blue scheme room no view as such no Minibar good toiletry 1 set place for double occupancy no hot water despite complaint no alternative offer either the layout of room be good but too many drawer and storage not sure for what old fixture in bathroom be strange the cup in our room be break and only 1 litre water provide Staff friendly and helpful though do not experience any out of way concern in any regard mostly run by gem hotel management student so response be prompt Food Indian selection be good but Chinese can be ignore Service be good and prompt Restro ruchira be pool side and good breakfast be good too Entertainment have several indoor game pool play area etc but pool be too small for a Saturday crowd Lot of insect in evening so that need concern Suggestions have to park bike in open air with no shelter in harsh rain which be quite non luxurious the welcom letter be of July we stay in august Small observation but sure can be look into miss any wow factor during entire experience the positive aspect of my stay be definitely the nice staff and a nice pool with lot of space to relax and an alright Indian restaurant Negative aspect though be that internet connection be awful English tv channel be work but not flawlessly also a piece of advice i go to the airport and back with Uber for 700 they want to pick me up for 800 so if you would like to save a bit of money then use an Uber also right now due to road construction it take about 25 30 minute from the airport all in all i would say it be a little overpriced stay very near to Bangalore city and airport Lovely property with a huge open ground lot of space for outdoor activity Room be very well organise with lot of storage space especially well space for a family travel with infant lik us Good staff and service Food be little pricey and lack of enough seating in the restuarant overall a nice place to spend weekend Lovely place food be excellent room be really nice and spacious Staff be lovely and very helpful there be n t much to do there so it be really a place for relaxation the only down side be the wifi be very poor and at time do n t work at all also there be no fridge in the room but it be really good value for money Awesome getaway offering whatever be list the place as indicate in oth review be away from the bustle city life Service be tad slow but that be what you nee to relax Property be new and clean just to bear in mind this be a resort so do n t expect a hotel like amenity nevertheless the food be really delicious and fresh the game arena have all sort of equipment to keep us busy we have our Annual Meet at fiestaa Resort n Event in April 2017 it be a very delightful experience for all of us the place be wide spread and have a beautiful build up area for gathering and official addres Breezy and peaceful Food be delicious and they have a pretty large spread the staff be very helpful and courteous oth facility since it be a fairly new property there be not too many activity but the pool area be neatly maintain they have a couple of play area for outdoor game like dart and badminton overall we have a pleasant event and no hassle during the event thank to the co operation of the staff Last minute decision and we end up spend our weekend at Fiestaa no regret the room be clean food be reasonably good they have a swimming pool and basic game like TT Board carom etc the property be hardly a few month old so i gues with time new amenity will be introduce must be thank to GM Sidharth for offer a package to us which work out pretty reasonable this venue be nice for a large group reception or a day outing i recommend the Resort be quite new and with lot of thing to be improve though Swimming pool and play area be prop Food be a bit costly and no oth option available as the resort be in a remote place Can use this as a weekend getaway leave wait at the airport for a prepay car pickup my room be a good size and basically clean but the interior of the room and hotel look tired and dirty with smudge mark on the

atmosphere be what strike us to consider have our daughters wedding at Fiestaa it be just the right location away from the city a 45 min drive from our home the greenery freshnes and cleanlines be the perfect place to create a memorable experience Food and bar service be excellent Siddharth the General Manager be extremely helpful very accommodative to all our need and requirement and be the key person in help make our event a memorable one even though we slightly over step on the timing Siddharth be so patient and understanding Thank you Siddharth their room be spacious and comfortable not forget the complimentary breakfast which be really good their friendly staff be attentive and helpful thank to the entire Fiestaa team for the wonderful service that day we have the most amazing day and our guest ca n t stop talk about it we be both absolutely delighted with how everything turn out i highly recommend Fiestaa for your wedding experience on that note a BIG THANK you and we look forward to return soon i stay here for a night with my family on a transit in Bangaluru we need to stay for a night in Bangaluru on our way to Chennai and this resort be just the place for that as it be very close to the airport it just take us approximately 20 minute to reach the resort from the airport the resort staff be very hospitable and check in be a breeze we have dinner at their open air restaurant and i should say the food be delicious and the same go for their breakfast Service be top notch and the room be also very clean the resort be in a village outside the city of Bangaluru so you would n t be affect by the city s pollution and chao its also not that far from the airport like 15 20 kilometer so if you want to transit in Bangaluru city then resort may just be the place the hotel employee be very nice and they will try their good to make you feel at home Full five star for fiestaa resort Excellent place to stay near airport its around 20 30 min from airport Route be kind of lonely during late night room be huge with lot of storage food be good Uber will work if timing be not odd Hotel can arrange cab if you nee drop of to airport but it will cost you twice that of Uber be here for a wedding recently and while the 4 acre property be quiet good it remote location make it troublesome while commute the service also be quite pathetic at time food in the buffet be not refill or be utterly cold Staff also have not be well trained and small request such a laundry bag be not attend to stay for a night here it be a wonderful place far from the city to relax and enjoy the free breakfast be yummy though the hotel staff be management trainee they be courteous Food be quite expensive and there be lot of fly during the daytime it close to the airport overall it a wonderful place to relax NIce place to stay during transit as it be very close to airport much cheap and comfortable than airport lounge if you nee to spend overnight to catch morning flight Clean room Friendly staff New property nice one but still lot to be improve i have face lot of problem its all occur due to lack of experience staff all the staff find as management trainee restaurant be situate outside with open area due to this lot of fly Pool area be good and lot of activity area available very slow internet stay for a night with my husband and infant boy We make a pit stop here and the drove off to nandi hill the hotel be decent and anyone require a hotel to stay near the airport can opt for it the food be especially delicious and the staff be friendly and polite over all not a bad stay at all stay here basi feedback from my sister who have a good stay few month bk Location away from hustle of city but peaceful and easy to locate with road signage room clean and well maintain have a blue scheme room no view as such no Minibar good toiletry 1 set place for double occupancy no hot water despite complaint no alternative offer either the layout of room be good but too many drawer and storage not sure for what old fixture in bathroom be strange the cup in our room be break and only 1 litre water provide Staff friendly and helpful though do not experience any out of way concern in any regard mostly run by gem hotel management student so response be prompt Food Indian selection be good but Chinese can be ignore Service be good and prompt Restro ruchira be pool side and good breakfast be good too Entertainment have several indoor game pool play area etc but pool be too small for a Saturday crowd Lot of insect in evening so that need concern Suggestions have to park bike in open air with no shelter in harsh rain which be quite non luxurious the welcom letter be of July we stay in august Small observation but sure can be look into miss any wow factor during entire experience the positive aspect of my stay be definitely the nice staff and a nice pool with lot of space to relax and an alright Indian restaurant Negative aspect though be that internet connection be awful English tv channel be work but not flawlessly also a piece of advice i go to the airport and back with Uber for 700 they want to pick me up for 800 so if you would like to save a bit of money then use an Uber also right now due to road construction it take about 25 30 minute from the airport all in all i would say it be a little overpriced stay very near to Bangalore city and airport Lovely property with a huge open ground lot of space for outdoor activity Room be very well organise with lot of storage space especially well space for a family travel with infant lik us Good staff and service Food be little pricey and lack of enough seating in the restuarant overall a nice place to spend weekend Lovely place food be excellent room be really nice and spacious Staff be lovely and very helpful there be n t much to do there so it be really a place for relaxation the only down side be the wifi be very poor and at time do n t work at all also there be no fridge in the room but it be really good value for money Awesome getaway offering whatever be list the place as indicate in oth review be away from the bustle city life Service be tad slow but that be what you nee to relax Property be new and clean just to bear in mind this be a resort so do n t expect a hotel like amenity nevertheless the food be really delicious and fresh the game arena have all sort of

thank to the co operation of the staff Last minute decision and we end up spend our weekend at Fiestaa no regret the room be clean food be reasonably good they have a swimming pool and basic game like TT Board carom etc the property be hardly a few month old so i gues with time new amenity will be introduce must be thank to GM Sidharth for offer a package to us which work out pretty reasonable this venue be nice for a large group reception or a day outing i recommend it a beautiful place to stay and the staff be very friendly and helpful it be a great place to relax and use as a home base i be

vicinity Close enough to old city and market for tour by tuk tuk or taxi Casa cottage be in a quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore after good review from trip advisor and lonely planet we decide to book here the room we have be a deluxe double upstair the bathroom be a little smelly lack of window and perhaps some drainage issue which be as happy to overlook as the room seem clean and have air con however overnight we find the air conditioner didnt work it be on but no air flow out so it wasnt a power issue and because the room be small and have no window it be very warm and uncomfortable to sleep i tell the manager in the morning but that afternoon it still wasnt work i be a little let down stay here this hotel be in the centre of Bangalore at first sight it be pretty with a garden and helpful staff however the staff seem to constantly change and not do very much the room be quite shabby with a poor bathroom and electrical socket come out of the wall it be more like a hostel and we have to find someone on the last day to make us breakfast already pay for as most review say Casa Cottage be certainly an oasi in the busy and noisy city of Bangalore the bed be comfortable the room large and the staff be wonderful most definitely the good part of the guesthouse if you be look for budget and basic accomodation then the cottage certainly fit the bill i dont believe there be many more choice in this price bracket the cottage could use with a good clean and paint and the breakfast could easily be improve with a little effort Filter coffee a bonu this be a really lovely place so surprising for a huge city in many way as it quiet and peaceful with a little garden and nice place to sit outside the room have lot of space and the staff be incredibly helpful highly recommend stay here with my family a rare property in Bangalore where you do n t feel like that you be in a metro city Locality though in the center of a busy and unorganised city be very calm and peaceful the cottage we have be clean and big they should provide well utensil in the kitchen net Breakfast be very simple in total a nice stay we stay at Casa Cottage for three night at the start of our trip and two night before fly home as all reviewer have say it be a real oasi in the madnes of Bangalore and also very convenient for visit the main shopping road and find place to eat the staff be excellent and so helpful and bother to give us the same room for each visit so that we could quickly settle in when they order you in a meal they do n t just present the container to you but set the food out on a table in the breakfast area provide plate and cutlery water and beer if request the breakfast choice be limited but more than adequate and serve over a lengthy period Coffee and tea be frequently offer when you return from a trip out Good advice on place to visit always forthcoming a real variety of people stay from many different country so we find ourselves involved in very interesting conversation Room be spacious bed comfortable plenty of hot water and food storage for clothe etc the sit out area be lovely but a cushion for the beach would be good as the backside do

atmosphere of the hotel with its small garden be quite nice however the service at check in be very slow and the breakfast take a long time to get prepared and be not ready at the announce time the

very safe and lively and quiet enough to retreat from the bustle city Good value for money in the center of town my main problem here be sleep the sheet be so cheap and nasty and the staff have no idea how to make a bed the towel again cheap and nasty but also incredibly old i can not understand why Lonely Planet be still recommend this place because it be quite expensive for what it be i arrive early afternoon and immediately give the staff 4 pair of sock and undie plus 2 short sleeve shirt to wash and tell them that i really need them as soon as possibly because the only oth sock and undie i have be what i be wear it take them 3 bloody day to do them and even then i have to go to the wash room and get them myself this be really unacceptable for a hotel in this price range as be the quality of the sheet and towel Lovely tranquil apartment in the crazy Mayhem that be Bangalore Great position just 5 minute in rickshaw from MG road Clean and cosy with simple breakfast serve in the lovely courtyard Manik and staff be really helpful and a wealth of knowledge on transport and restaurant etc Nothing be too much trouble i spend a very pleasant three night here actually one night at Casa Cottage itself and 2 night in a nearby apartment that the owner maintain for guest when they do n t have any room available at the Cottage the employee all seem like family and be always available to answer question help out with a request etc a great choice if like me you prefer small unique inn to big modern hotel with pool and big flat screen tv Positives Outside from Bangalore

Road in Bengaluru which make it prime property the service be okay the food be quite good and can be enjoy on a roof top restaurant the idea be to ignore the room which be not quite clean but it be expect of a budget hotel like this very nice place to stay Neat and clean no unnecessary disturbance in the lobby or the corridor Helpful staff Wonderful food all of this make for a very pleasant stay if you be travel to Bangalore do try out this place it a good hotel locate in the heart of Bangalore city room be neatly maintain and breakfast provide be good very close to pub and oth restaurant in MG road i like the hotel for its location and facility Will stay again when i m in Bangalore Absolute value for money hotel in Bangalore stay here when ever be in Blore and to be frank cant even think of any oth place oth than Vellara so close to all the most happening place in the town plus decent car parking facility plus smile face around you neat n tidy room very reasonably price too well do Mr Antony be a hotelier myself i tell my team to function like Vellara cheer this a very nice hotel i enjoy a very delicious breakfast i think the hotel and very good service and pleasant staff i would stay here again if i return to Bangalore the location be close to shop and restaurant and not far from the train station i decide on stay at this because it be well place next to Richmond and Brigade street Most of the happen place be walk able from here regard the place to start with the Pros great location walk able via nice footpath to brigade junction staff try to be friendly and make an effort display their service standard they let you check in before 12 noon but beware that they ask to leave after complete 24 hr so if you check in at 6 be they expect you to get out at 6 be the next day however for me i manage to stay till 10 be the next day Hot water available 24 hour all Room Service call be well attend they provide a newspaper and breakfast be decent south Indian stuff now for the con even a bottle of water be not complimentary so you nee to buy one for INR 25 room be very small have a window but no view at all so overall you have much space there be dresser and a small coffee table with two comfortable sofa there be constant chill even if AC be off because room do not get direct sunlight however i feel at an approximate r 2000 per day it way too expensive for the facility provide and you do have some well place option around this zone Vellara Hotel be the first hotel i stay at during my first trip to India as a solo female traveler i feel perfectly safe at the hotel Location slightly south of the main commercial part of Brigade Road Vellara Hotel be the perfect base to explore Bengaluru from it only take about 5 10 min to walk to the popular shopping area of Brigade Rd 20 min to walk to Commercial Street and 30 min to walk to Cubbon Park also because of the night life around that area during the weekend i feel quite safe as a lone female traveler walk back to the hotel at night by myself Food the hotel provide breakfast to all guest the chai be delicious and oh so thick and they also make fresh Masala Dosas which be perfectly crispy on the outside and fill with very well seasoned potato stuffing inside the idli be also very soft and perfect with the tomato sauce room i stay there on 2 separate night the room provide the first night be well than the one i get after i get back from Hampi Main difference be the more apparent smell of cigarette in the second room Staff i be in contact with the Vellara Hotel staff before i get to Bengaluru because i want to arrange a pick up service from the airport since i would be arrive at around 2 be in the morning the staff would answer my question clearly and concisely and arrange for a driver to pick me up after i arrive in Bengaluru they also call the driver to confirm that it be the right guest who would be come to their hotel when i get to the hotel the night shift manager be also all smile and make sure i get everything i need before i head to my room in the morning because of the long evening the night manager actually call me 30 minute before breakfast be about to close to make sure that i would not mis breakfast they also be super accommodate and keep my luggage for me while i travel to Hampi for the price of the place the quality of service be absolutely superb definitely recommend Vellara Hotel for any traveler who be look for a friendly no frill stay in the middle of Bengaluru it be a SUPERB HOTEL SPECIALLY the STAFF one PERSON call GABRIEL be EXTRA FRIENDLY and excellent in help customer Only negative feed back be that book your room by bookings com and you get a cheap rate than book a room on site Prof Nalin Ashubodha Sri Lankan live in USA the hotel be locate in the heart of the city which be its big plus point the staff be very friendly and the room be clean however the breakfast room be very noisy and dirty i never expect a hotel which have an excellence certificate from Trip Advisor to have such a shabby roof top restaurant this be the only downside of this restaurant which be why i be not give it a five star rating there be a bakery next door where you can get most of your immediate need oth than this one negative point about the rooftop restaurant if you be look for a decent budget type accommodation in Bangalore go for this place but do nt have high expectation very Bad management Price be for 3 star hotel but facility and service be as of 1 star hotel Food be terrible Toilet be very bad i book through internet look nice post picture but in reality it be very different Hotel Vellara have the follow Clean Rooms and toilet Good Food Courteous and helpful Staff Value for Money in term of location it walk distance from MG Road yet away from the hustle and bustle i highly recommend Hotel Vellara to busines and leisure traveler we stay here for 2 day it be locate in center of bengalore acces to all place include metro very clean and nice place to stay Friendly front office staff and nice south indian breakfast they provide free wifi and car parking Vellara be agood Hotel Clean Nice room in the heart of city Front desk staff be good and help in sight seeing and car booking in reasonable price we stay in a 3 bed room the room be quite big the hotel have wifi which be also good the have a nice rooftop restaurant this serve complementary nice breakfast also the breakfast be good and enough Dhosa and Omlett can also be order additionally the restaurant have good food selection for dinner you nee to order and it may take 20 minute Restaurant staff need little more training they should provide salt peeper Tomato sauce along with order food where need also Tissue paper water be not properly serve you nee to visit the counter for these small thing also in cabin complementary tea coffee arrangement with a kettle would have be nice otherwise the hotel be very nice and comfortable with this price range i have book this place for multiple guest for a function in June 2015 i should definitely mention that the staff be very flexible and warm they make all effort to keep the guest happy the hotel itself be not busines like but be very comfortable for a simple stay in the heart of the city with easy acces to MG Road Richmond Road etc Would definitely recommend for a family stay i stay there for around a week and the staff be very hospitable which make me feel so much at home and i love the mini dosa that they make for breakfast Will never mis stay there the next time i m n bangalore i recently stay at the Vellara Hotel and have a lovely stay my room be very clean and comfortable which make all the difference when you be travel for an extended time and i simply love the dosa marsala and tea they provide

simple delicious South Indian brekky on the delightful cover roof deck it be such a nice way to start the day i highly recommend this place because of the staff cleanlines and location Fantastic property well maintain conveniently locate and the most friendly yet non intrude staff a good property for both busines and leisure friend and family Breakfast spread be awesome the most important plus point be cover car park most property do not have parking facility if you love non veg option this hotel have a tie up with Tom s Restaurant which serve really good noodle and you have Fanoos locate diagonally opposite Vellara Will definitely recommend to all i have be stay at this place every time i visit bangalore and always i have be very happy with the service provided thi time the hotel be renovate and make to look prettier the service have be as good as always also the rooftop breakfast have be very good the fresh egg dosa puri and so on a array of dish to display for for your pallate we be a family of three adult so we choose a three bedded room the room be spacious with enough room to store the luggage without make us feel cramped the hotel seem to be an old property but with renovation have all the modern amenity to make for a comfortable stay the breakfast serve on the shady terrace on the top floor with green plant all around be simple but adequate the staff at the reception be friendly and helpful they be willing to give direction to place we want to go help hail a cab when necessary and be very polite Room attendant be also nice to deal with the hotel be at a walking distance from the main M G Road another plus point there be many eatery around the area offer multi cuisine fare Sight seeing be easy from here with both auto rickshaw and cab available easily on the whole we have a good experience stay at the hotel we stay in this hotel for 5 day at first i be upset when i see the entrance be look old style but when i go up to the room very happy to see a clean and good size of room Staffs be really very friendly Wifi connection and speed be really good Breakfast be limited but really good one i do nt have any complaint becz i enjoy my stay here after a particularly bad experience with another hotel for our first few day in Bangalore Lusia Inn never even consider this place Vellara Hotel feel like a 5 star palace the room be big and clean with good air conditioning Wifi be a little slow average about 1 5mbps down and around 0 7mbp up but it be reliable with no dropout and it seem slow connection be the norm across India Staff be extremely friendly and helpful they even use their personal account to call an Uber for us sometimes as we do n t have datum on our phone Location be fantastic with many great restaurant nearby we do n t shop much but if you re into that we see many western brand name shop around we like this place so much that we stay again a second time for a 1 night transit in Bangalore the hotel be locate on the main road but the it be not very prominent so you will have to look out for the sign board i visit this hotel when it be under renovation and be weary of what it could offer however my fear be lay to rest when i enter and see the quality of room the reception area be also small but it do have a lounge area with seating for visitor the hotel have a lift that take you up to the room and the rooftop restaurant the room be quite large and with custom build bed 2 single sofa dress table cupboard television fan and air condition the bathroom be very clean and have run hot water the variety of the complimentary breakfast provide be a limited but good you can also order for room service if you be look for a budget hotel with good amenity this be the one for you Small Kerala style hotel right on Brigade Road not know by name to many cab driver yet you can reach the hotel without much difficulty just because it be on Brigade Road Tell the driver the addres he will take you close to the hotel Look around and you will see the hotel signboard the entrance be a bit awkward and the reception be not a big grandeur one but you shoudn t judge the room by your first impression in fact room be quite spacious the hotel be 30 min walk from M G Road it location be really good just walk along the Brigade road towards North come out of the hotel turn right walk straight at the junction with Museum Road take right i e continue on Brigade Road walk straight take no oth turn till you hit M G Road M G Road in Bengaluru be the most happen street flush with party animal during weekend shop heaven dining paradise bla bla bla you must visit it in the evening at least once the airport be about 40 km from the hotel give the nasty Bengaluru traffic it may take even 2 hr to reach the hotel during peak hour so be careful while catch your departure flight that way the hotel be close to Yeshwanthpura railway station 15 km away i e 45 min travel time Metro station be on M G Road you have to either walk for half an hour or take a cab to reach the hotel from the metro station room be big and clean linen be okayish toilet be spacious too we do n t have bath tub in our toilet so not sure about it room be undergo renovation so do inspect the room before you check in toiletry be minimal well to carry your own set Hot water be available be beside a busy road the hotel be noisy even at night if you have sleep problem in noisy ambience be cautious Morning breakfast be complimentary in CP plan it have two type of fruit if you be late in reach the top floor makeshift dining hall you may not get fruit bread butter jam omelette you have to tell the attendant to prepare for you it be not readily available on the table south Indian item like idly dosa again you have to order upma uttapam and cornflake with milk overall though not fancy it be sufficient to fill you up for the day there be few restaurant around but we find them quite costly for budget traveler for lunch and dinner we prefer to have them on any of the myriad of restaurant on M G Road and then take Ola Uber to come back to the hotel if you come out of the hotel and walk right a few step you will find a nice ice cream parlour where you can relish your desert the hotel have no full fledged restaurant of its own however if you nee basic food you can go to the top floor kitchen and tell them to prepare Chicken curry and rice be readily availability upon order they take some time to prepare so you may order from your room and then go there after half an hour the good part be that they have a tie up with a nearby restaurant wherefrom they provide room service for a variety of food the menu card keep inside the room be for that purpose only WiFi be average you may use multiple device too room have both air conditioner and fan they have no travel desk but the front desk manager can arrange car for you if you tell him previous night Cubbon park Ulsoor lake Vidhana Soudha yes it be worth visit in Bengaluru and Lalbagh be nearby Bangalore palace be also not far be centrally locate the hotel be good to put up for sight seeing too next to the hotel be the all Saints Stores and Bakery which be

friendly staff the room be very adequate with very comfortable bed yes i know lot of very the hotel have a few unique advantage there be several electricity socket in the bedroom 6 separate double

the budget conscious visitor you get a lot of quality for what you pay Located on Brigade road about 900 m south of MG road the area be perfect there be many many restaurant both Indian and western

busines contract in arama suite with my crew they have a very good breakfast prepare for us in the morning the front office staff be so kind that they arrange a cab for us to reach the site sweetgesture 24 hour check in be a plus very good breakfast at chavadi room quality be average old looking so many vessel provide with only microwave owen no gas stove provide what be the use i think they should remove them and cut down the price Nice hotel on the edge of a residential area the room be a little dated and wear but the place be clean hot water fridge and bottled water in the room everyday the rooftop restaurant where breakfast be serve be quite good for a meal also Friendly staff and an all round good experience for the price Hotel seem a little over price for the service the good part about Arama Suites be the food Breakfast and dinner be really good the only issue face be about the Wifi and hot water apart from it everything be smooth and staff be responsive the Check in be smooth and well handle by professional the room be quite small with Air Conditioner and a Queen Size Bed there be a Coffee Maker in the room the Linen be quite clean the bathroom be really clean with hot water available through out the day in case you be take your driver along with you they don t have any facility for the driver to stay over night they do provide a rest room and a bath room for the driver the Complimentary Break Fast be good on the roof top over all a budget hotel with good facility i will definitely vouch you all to try the property once it be worth every penny you pay the place be good People be humble Breakfast be great but somehow the place lack maintenance and people there have no idea of how to fix that like i face regular fault in washroom TV connection etc

what i do nt like the restaurant on terrace be hit with the local it have fantastic ambiance food be ok and drink be fairly price the breakfast be very limited and be in banagalore they be very bad in local cuisine i have my car but they prefer give parking in the hotel to chavadi guest then to in house guest so quiet disappointed about that forget in room service it take more than an hr to get that at night better go upstairs i recently stay here for a month with my family the staff here be very co operative and friendly the room be decent enough with all the basic facility and almost no

Great restaurant upstairs very clean Fantastic laundry service very neatly pack when laundry return the hotel be locate by the side of a forest side of IIM the restaurant be very nice and different non Indian cuisine be there and a very good manger handle the restaurant that be situate on the fourth floor but the thing be do n t like the room because it too noisy and not that high quality i have one if the good stay at the Palm meadow club and the service extend by Mr Deb Mohanty the duty manager be exemplary i have never experience this level of service even in Taj group of hotel i really want to place my sincere appreciation for the effort he take to find a suitable accommodation for my driver which be close to the palm meadow club i wish him all succes and he be ensure that for my future Bangalore visit pal meadow club will be prefer place Overall nice experience with family and friend and good getaway for a weekend realize later that one should spend at least two day there to enjoy all the amenity support staff available 24 7 Everything be great except one bad experience they do not give enough drinking water in the room two 500ml bottle in a day Rest will be charge 100 rupee for 1 litre i feel water be the basic necessity and should be give in ample and should not be charge the price we pay to stay there even for 1 night should be sufficient to cover a few litre of water for visit pax Room service be great and very prompt staff be very cordial Buffet spread for lunch and breakfast be good in number and great in taste the staff be incredible and go out of the way to make sure i be take care of it be my first time in India and be ambitious about try the food long story short i get sick due to the new exposure of food and environment the staff work at the bar Avishek Arindam and Rajan take great care of me they go way out of their way just to make sure i be satisfied with the food and the atmosphere my company have an office here oth employee have recommend the stay here but i will be sure move forward that this be the place that they all stay at when they visit India would not be my top destination for a vacation but i would literally come here just to hangout with these guy again we be four family with 7 kid under 9 and this be an apt place for our get together the ambience be simply relax and not that crowded it be very spacious the swim pool cover a large area and very less depth and very attractive and safe for both child and adult alike the room be good and well ventilate we have both lunch and dinner would suggest to go for la carte and that would cost less if you be a large group the Spa be very good and relaxing so it be a must to give it a try the play area for both child and adult be very good overall we have a wonderful and memorable time and would recommend this place highly again get opportunity to stay here enjoy as usual again meet with Dining staff Iskara Gopinath Great work guy keep it up Nice food and wine Excellent stay i recommend to stay here at least once Himanshu Pachauri Palm meadow club be a surprise wait to be enjoy with all the amenity like 3 pool basketball court snooker TT and much more this resort be a great place for a weekend retreat the room have their private balcony and be well maintain but as always the people make the place and the service here be excellent Mr Gopinath from the restaurant really go the extra mile to make our stay comfortable and memorable Big kudo to the management for maintain such a pretty place Will surely recommend and come again Nice place and friendly staff the room be cozy Good food nice ambience and hospitality a Serenity in the middle of a metro city the most important part be Mr Gopinath he be amazing and take good care of mine during my dinner i stay here to celebrate my wedding anniversary i must say this place be highly overprice as compare to service which be offer we be charge upto 7kfor one day stay exclude lunch and dinner and it only include 2lltr of water bottle breakfast and swimming pool to my surprise even WiFi be chargeable Never see this before Lunch and dinner be charge Rs1000 per head taxis Service charge even though food be not serve at our table since it be buffet Service charge be include by default in all bill when question i be tell it be optional and then remove not sure why it be include by default Food serve in Lunch and dinner be below average since it be completely test less we do not enjoy a single dish Breakfast be somewhat okay for some reason i feel entire club be build and design keep in mind confirm of foreign guest for e g no jet pipe in toilet test less food we Indians often prefer masala and spicy food look like table near swimming pool be reserve for foreign guest only while have lunch and evening snack multiple time we ask for table near swimming pool but each time we be deny and tell it be reserve after we insist we get those table simply by remove RESERVED board from it overall we spend 13k for one day and we do not feel it be worth one could easily enjoy at oth place by spend probably less amount that this we go there for our anniversary celebration for one night stay as per our experience start from stay and food be very expensive and the quality which you get in return be not worth room be clean and big but even though we have put privacy board and we go out still hotel staff come inside for their service which be not expect come to the food except breakfast whatever be there in menu be bit expensive and very less food option so we opt for buffet for lunch and dinner in that also taste be below average plus service be very slow one more thing which we observe be that staff be more attentive towards foreign guest as compare to local which be bit disappointing we will not recommend to anyone it be nice stay for us we really enjoy our trip Few thing i want to update for well service 1 morning breakfast my wife be eat breakfast at 10 10am and 1 indian waitres start to remove buffet its really feel bad when some one eat and u be remove buffet even its not 10 30am also as your closing timing she stop her breakfast leave to room 2 security i be drive near to supermarket inside the villa and due to some reason i put horn the security come and behave very rudely first of all you should inform us what s the rule and regulation there and talk politly we be human mistake happen that s really bad 3 swimmimg pool we be come there for our enjoyment if there be rule to use swimming pool you should inform before i be talk about uniform you should keep some uniform for guest who be not bring their swimmimg kit rather than to stop us to use swimmimg pool without inform we do nt come there to sit in villa Rest all be good Room service be excellent Bar attendant be excellent and specially Bell Boy from assam guy he be excellent in his work Thank you Alok kumar Checkin be pretty smooth we be show our room and tell about the service that be include we stay in luxury king room Room be spacious along with a small garden balcony however washroom be a little congested there be three swimming pool which require prop swimming costume for use indoor heated pool skull cap be must pool be pretty clean and whole property be very nicely maintain there be spa which be good and fairly price Property be surround by greenery and be nicely maintain there be two restaurant cafe palmyra and cafe Travern we dine in palmyra Ambience 4 5 5 Service 4 5 Food 3 5 Lunch buffet price at 950 r taxis lack variety do not have any starter whatever be available taste fine Buffet breakfast be good have lot of variety and taste good in Ala carte lot of dish werent available mostly indian menu be available i would define recommend the stay here at first you would be wonder whether you be enter a villa community or a resort then you realise it be bit of both this be not exactly a typical resort the resirt here be the Club House of the Adarsh Palm Meadows but do n t reject it rightaway it have Kid s Pool Resort like Pool and Swimmer Pool all at one place you also have a indoor heated pool for beginner Food be amazingly great sometimes even well than 5 star hotel the South indian dish be delicious the Bar be very cozy and watch sport in bar while have your drink and food you can spend hour here it have a beauty parlour a decent spa carrom board gym table tenni aerobic floor library badminton table tenni basketball court the villa community have lot of foreign national hence you would feel you be in some place outside India if not for the indian staff member it be ideal for weekend nearby trip Beautiful property Food and drink be very good Hotel staff be very nice to us they arrange a birthday cake on my wife s request my kid have a lovely time in the pool Cons too many mosquito and they do n t allow us in the Taven bar as we have a 2 year old baby i go there with family this resort be very beautiful and good part be so many swimming pool there be one swim pool of warm water too room be big clean staff be very helpful and good food stay at this place for a night with family Nice property with restaurant bar swimming pool kid play area spa car parking etc Service and infrastructure at the property be very good Check in and Checkout be smooth their main attraction be the swim pool area which have a slide and large kid pool Food menu be a mix of cuisine and have decent variety Few point to note Cost be on the high side especially for food and oth service give the value and location The property could be maintain better lot of insect and mosquito find some place be not clean as per expectation Overall good stay but would n t call it value for money Expect a surplu of 30 on the room rent and take a call Would be much easy choice if they could curb the service cost a little not many people know that this place exist and the experience be quite different to oth resort around Bangalore its quite classy yet have a charm Food be great the bar be great the slide to the pool be great yes you do not know do u there be slide and the hospitality be just amazing it a wonderful place where one can get away for a weekend rejuvenate and then rush back fresh to daily crime we do one draw back be the cost slightly on the high side but you get what you pay for all in all a good place and a great trip we have go to Palm Meadows club to celebrate our twin birthday it be a fabulous place for child a lot of place for them to play the staff be very helpful and pleasant they help us organize cake for the birthday the food be excellent they even have a kid menu which the kid enjoy all in all it be a wonderful weekend getaway hope to come back soon Food cuisine and the variety a total let down above all mosquito menace at a t peak no pest control anything or so ca n t step out of your room after 6 pm else mosquito gon na make a meal out of you Stay be alright but food and pest control not at all upto it mark Palm Meadows Club be a very nice resort with top clas 5 star like amenity and great comfort feel nestle in beautiful Plam Meadows Villa s this resort have very calm and soothing ambience you never feel you be so close to busy part of Whitefield and East Bangalore Resort be very family friendly and feel very safe look like there be something to Njoy for all age group the room be great very clean comfortable and spacious Front Desk as well as all Service staff be very courteous prompt and helpful Do n t mis the morning Breakfast which be excellent Nice Restaurant s and room service be also excellent their Liaison service at Airport be excellent and they have a 24 7 presence at Airport for any need include transportation stay here on two occasion and would love to comeback again we love the place and facility the pool dining area etc be really fab kid enjoy the play area pool and game the location calmnes and peace everywhere be really nice the breakfast buffect be decent with indian and international cuisine what we do nt like they do nt give us a private area to enjoy as a group when its a group of 16 it become hard to sit together in room since outside they have people live we have to be quit Wish we have consider this before we book this place we have request use of one of one of their private party hall but then they want to charge more for it the kitchen service be really really slow and with large group like our order ala carte become even messy they should have some buffet option and well selection over all love the place but will think twice before eat there we have visit Palm Meadows 4 time with our baby every time we visit there we all enjoy the most especially we enjoy Tennis Court and the swimming pool it be a well clean and maintain property the staff be courteous i would like to mention about Mr GOPINATH DEY who work in the restaurant he be so kind professional during our last visit which be 6 month ago we meet him and he could still remember us he be so thoughtful to give our 2 year some cookie as a complimentary this be always a place for us to relax and spend time with family CONS the only concern we have be that twice during our visit we face issue with the staff at the kid swimming pool First time my 8 year old nephew who be play in kid pool jump to the oth part of the pool which be for adult and it be quiet deep and he be cry for help but the staff stand over the kid pool be just laugh look at him without lend any help though we inform him that the child do n t know swimming a foreigner lady who be swim there rush to help him and another staff from nowhere run to save him from drown by lift him up Next time we see another two kid play in the kid spool and the staff stand at the start of the slide allow two kid to slide immediately and the one get injure at his head the mother ask him about him and his reaction be unprofessional i be in Bangalore for busines and i stay here for three night all the time i enjoy my stay the room be great Clean and with lot of toiletry the AC have just the right cool temperature and the bed the most important factor be exquisitely medium soft a bonu for the complementary cookie and fruit and not just the usual water bottle unfortunately i do n t have time to try the big pool or the tenni court but they both look very nice perhaps next time the breakfast buffet offer great variety of both Indian and International dish which i think be default for a hotel on this level i try the hotel dinner once and this be probably the most surprising thing of all during my stay i take the Indian lamb dish and i be prepared that i would take a while to arrive but after just 10 minute it come and it be a delicious treat too so do n t mis to eat dinner here too a highly recommend place to stay in Bangalore this be Palm meadow club be the clubhouse of the palm meadow gate community which be extremely beautiful with its tree line street and villa feel like we be in the state Pros Room be spacious clean great mini bar prompt and courteous house keep service Great bathroom with bathtub Amazing pool facility with a lap pool indoor heated pool and kid section with a slide Tennis badminton basketball court all well maintain the cocktail at the restaurant be really nice Cons two restaurant but have the same menu Outdoor seating at the restaurant look so beautiful at night but too many mosquito even with coil to actually enjoy it the Oak Tavern be present like a pub but the ambience be like a family restaurant it would help to have some music or something to set the mood no couple room in the spa which be offer by all star rate hotel the taste of the food at Palmyra and Oak Tavern could do with some improvement but nothing worth complain about while check out the proces be smooth and simple that night when i be at home i realise that i have forget my phone charger in the room i call them up and they check the room and find the charger i would have really appreciate it if they check the room and give it to me while i be check out as be the norm or even if they call me an hour or so later and tell me abt it rather than me find about it late at night these small thing make a difference when you market yourself as a 5 star resort Would like to thank Mr Anbu at Palmyra restaurant for his courteous service all in all i would like to say that if u look for a break from the city and enjoy physical activity like sport and swimming this be the place for you but if you be look to get pamper with great food and drink then think again Nice hotel well organized and clean the staff be very professional and always do the good to help and satisfy your request Restaurant be good but it may be improve for a 5 star hotel be a good hotel either for busines trip as well as relax vacation i stay in Palm meadow club for 4 night with 5 friend after RELAXATION then AVOID on arrival we book 3 twin room however on arrival find out one room be a double we explain to the manager that we have book twin as all couple werent married romantically involve and need separate bed we be tell there have be a mix up with the booking and that they could provide us with a twin room the next evening at this time it be 1 am they provide a bed on wheel with plastic sheeting the bed moved and plastic crackle all evening room room be a little outdated half the plug dont work and the fridge door didnt close however there be load of TV channel available for free many UK film there be a free iron board and hair dryer plus lovely view from the balcony Pool kid run around scream non stop parent leave them to cause chao use water gun and kick ball around they do not use the kid pool and be in all pool area load of fly and not many bed around the pool however we always manage to get 6 bed no problem Staff restaurant bar Avoid the food slow service cold temperature Avoid the bar slow service no beer no wine in a 5 hotel Crazy Expect slow poor service throughout your whole stay its a chore to order and pay Staff try to over charge multiple time for food drink one member of staff try to change an additional 1000 on top of a bill the only thing i would return for the spa very cheap price would recommend the Spa pedicure and aromatherapy massage however kid scream in the corridor kill the relaxation vibe and again decor be out date this hotel be so beautiful the staff be so friendly the room so clean the food excellent and the atmosphere amazing Its so peaceful here and lovely sit around the pool or even go for a walk around the ground totally recommend Everything start out fine i arrive early Sunday morning around 630 am the check in at reception be quick easy and friendly the porter take my bag and bring me to my room fully stock mini bar water and snack available Room be clean and comfortable when i awake Sunday afternoon i realize there be a wedding be host at the club therefore i anticipate some noise that evening i be awake several time Sunday evening but it be n t too bad Monday night be a different story it seem the party continue and there be very disturbing noise shout what sound like furniture be throw around i complain several time to reception but the noise continue throughout the night as i be on busines and try to overcome my jet lag i decide to check out Tuesday morning and move to another hotel i do however enjoy the food in both restaurant excellent recommendation and service by the waiter there it unfortunate that the hotel can not manage rowdy guest not at all what i would have expect from this establishment Reception try to convince me to stay and tell me the troublesome guest be check out today however i do not want to risk it i be also disappointed i be n t compensate for the inconvenience and charge full rate for the 3 day i wo n t be return to Palm Meadows Club i have be to Palm Meadows in Feb 2019 this be my first visit here i do n t know such a place could exist in the middle of the bustle traffic Bengaluru be know for the clean road inside the gate community and the green very well maintain lawn in front of the beautiful house along the road upto the entrance of the resort be simply superb once inside the resort the check in proces be very smooth and quick the room i be give be on the ground floor it be do up well though there be some civil work go on inside there be absolutely no disturbance the food be also good especially the buffet breakfast it have a good spread of dish which cater to both Indian and Continental dish be a teetotaller ca n t say anything about the bar and and the drink one of the bad stay i have this be just a club house of a society and they market it as 5 star resort please dont waste ur money there be wedding event and no one be bother about us Want to give 0 star nice resort which be situate in the main area of IT hub in old airport it be fully cover by Green tree and you feel like you be out of town to some hilly resort Resort be good with lot of amenity like temperature control pool lot of game include badminton and tenni court they have indor game like snooker kid play area etc Food be expensive and not much variety better to order from Swiggy overall a good stay and enjoy a lot they have jacuzzi sauna and steam it be really worth we be about 30 of us and the only regret we have be of not be able to stay at the Palm Meadow for more than one night from the staff to the chef to the bu boy to the security they be all at our call and nee that it seem like we never leave home the food be particularly what move us all the quality of their spice and ingredient use be really reflect in the final dish we will definitely be go back for more hi so we decide to walk from Whitefield to Vartur a mere 6kms of good fair not so good and dust roadway mostly all with no pavement and at least 50 of the pavement in existence be break what a pity that the civic authority here do not look after their municipal asset as it be the Bangalore wall ability index be a very low 8 we be hungry when we reach Palm Meadows and their Club House restaurant be a veritable oasi of goody of coffee juice and idli i love a good idli fluffy not too dense just able to soak up the Samvad and to be engorge with coconut the tomato relish Yummy here the service be ok the coffee super and the idli delicious a modest yet more than suitable range of goody for all palate and hunger level we have two round of idli sambar four our trouble and then walk home to Whitefield well do and thank i be n t sure initially whether my travel team make a wise choice of book this hotel for me since it be a busines stay i strongly recommend this property which be ideal to take your family as well if you be on a busines trip and ofcourse recommend for a leisure stay as well the good part be the location of this property which be situate between few hundred villa cover in lush green environment this be now my favorite place in Bangalore Everything be well arrange include the room gym pool both indoor and outdoor food and most importantly service Do nt mis the early morning or evening walk outside the property just one thing that be a complete turnoff be one reception lady staff with her hair bunne up who never have a smile on her face and look extremely arrogant that be the only thing that piss me off rest be 10 on 10 stay at the property and it be situate in the midst of sprawl villa which be beautifully build and have wonderful landscaping inside the same campu be the palm meadow club and hotel which house multiple badminton court swimming pool squash court hot water pool SPA tenni and many oth facility the food be also good and well make i have three issue during my stay First be that the internet be not work fix be that the staff place a modem in my room second be that the aur conditioning be not work and on my complaint it be fix third be that the hotel do not have driver available when i need a cab from them i have to wait for 20 min before one arrive Rest of the thing be in place i suggest that the staff nee to check these basic facility before hand over the room to the guest it be difficult to believe that this kind of place exist right in the middle of city the place be so serene quite it give a quick fresh feeling Food be delicious i will be definitely visit again not too far off from Whitefield the Pal Meadows Club be quiet a nice place to visit and spend a private day alone or with your love one you be not allow to roam around outside the club for long time the local store security guard follow us and warn so yet a pleasant evening walk near the Villas be indeed soothing the swimming pool can be use on rental basi the food be really tasty and the complimentary breakfast be wholesome and have variety of cuisine to cater to you palate we visit this place on our anniversary and have a good time be sporty couple the highlight be Badminton court table tenni pool and heated pool with Sauna and steam the spa be Average and would suggest them to up their quotient the room be comfortable and the club surround be clean and well maintain Cafe Palmyra be good but one need to be aware of lunch and dinner timing the only down point be we do n t feel like be in a 5 star property somewhere around 3 5 to 4 star be what i would rate all in all a good experience thumb up to build something like this within city limit Excellent resort to stay in Bangalore very peaceful in center of city and staff also very polite it be a great time Amazing pool food indoor outdoor game Well maintain garden Totallyyyyyyyyy superbbbbb Excellent infrastructure but poorly train staff Staff be very courteous but too slow Staff be make too much noise during day time Breakfast buffet spread be awesome but coffee not all that good for the rent charge we expect even better locate in Whitefield this be a well know club and hotel and offer great quality though i find the room rate to be high than comparative property in the surround area one of the highlight stay here be the excellent meal at the club restaurant room be quite big in size with small sit out to enjoy a cup of tea amongst a lot of greenery one can even walk barefoot on the gras Beautiful ambience and a pool too Friendly staff willing to help we book 2 night stay here for my birthday it a Club House of palm meadow villa convert into a resort Pool be good with lot of oth club activity Food be average well maintain property to relax for a weekend Its more than a hotel every facility be available there i really love it every facility like swimming gym Spa playing restaurant be available even you can make a plan for buying rental a villa inside this campu really its unique this be almost my 2nd home now Have be stay here since 5 6 month stay with family as well completely safe superb breakfast in front of big swimming pool under shade Big room with multiple option in shower in bathroom and tub this facility be locate inside one of Bangalore s most post gate villa development on the Whitefield area this be essentially the club house of the community and maybe they later turn into a hotel resort anyhow they have excellent facility all around especially around the water body there be a slide which the kid enjoy a lot they have also make an area of the pool with a beach like entry which i think be very cleverly do the service be excellent the room be large and comfortable have excellent sleep every room come with a balcony which be a nice thing to have the bathroom be provide with quality toiletry the breakfast be good when you be in Southern part of India go for the dish typical to the region idly vara sambar dosa uttapam etc which be tasty and be good on the tummy as well the service all around be excellent when you book you can call the hotel reception and ask for a room on the first floor with pool face balcony very Good Hotel i have stay there for 3day Overal Experiance be good all staff be customer friendly this be very good hotel for family vacation Food be good Room garden and pool be very beautiful we stay here for a few day recently but feel that it be a beautiful place which be indeed really nice but can be improve and enhance the club room be nice and a good size but mattress be not comfortable Breakfast layout be good but if you get a few minute late they be very uncompromising about serve you a good place to stay gym and heated pool be excellent this be situate between the residential villa community of Palm Meadows it be about 1 Km from the main road the room be good and they have buffet facility for the breakfast for the dinner they serve a la carte only the next day morning i wake up to see a lizard on the lamp table near my bed as i be rush to my office i inform the Palm Meadows team at the reception i show them the photo of the lizard as well to make them act on it and not cause any issue for oth customer later the Palm Meadows team member not write the name call me to mail the photo of the lizard which i do i do n t get any acknowledgment reply message or a note from them probably this be a very normal scenario Hope the team take require action to drive back the lizard out Attached be a photo too the Club their pool side for an outdoor session and choice of food at the restaurant for a quick meal be all wonderful to take in the ambience be distinctively up market that can give a 5 star hotel a run for it money Awesome service by SARALA the receptionist very sweet the good person to be in service industry thank u

upgrade be do without additional charge at the go automatically but here they inform that though there be room available with a well view but that be not part of our package though we be a bit disappointed but it be fine our overall experience be good enough to make us go again i shouldnt be write this review as i want to keep the place all to myself be visit for year and i love it as a getaway from the traffic noise smog and chao that be Bangalore Set a mile into a private estate the clubhouse be a five star hotel with nice room and good of all a peaceful night to sleep the bar serve both international and local cuisine to a good standard and the staff smile and couldnt be more helpful they have recently improve the internet and although not blindingly fast be very acceptable i have be there on 25th May to 27 th june 2018 my first think why i be not here for so many year this club resort be complete package for family as well as solo traveler and to above all

pool and all set in a gate estate with the hotel among manicured villa hi this be an awesome place we be a group of 35 member and everyone enjoy d place have a great party the food be good the staff be excellent especially Mrs Sarala be excellent She really take care of us Everyone in our group enjoy Music be great and we all have great fun Thank u so much Mrs Sarala for make the day a memorable one plan to visit again this be my third visit Everything about this resort be very good in term or staff service cleanies check out and check in Activities within the resort be available but jus one thing the billard area and the kid section next to billard can be improve the billard table n the cue be completely wear out the kid section do not have thing to play in that area also please take care of the food pricing i feel they be extremely over price otherwise as a couple family kid or senior citizen can have great time can enjoy stay at the resort Wonderfulllllllllll place surely will visit again Palm Meadows club be locate inside the gate community which be a very nice place to stay the ambiance be too good and the room be very well maintain infact you do not feel like come out of the room however the food be not bad nee to work on the taste have an excellent 2day 1night stay at Palm Meadows positive the facility provide be very well maintain there be multiple swimming pool Tennis court Gym badminton court etc the food be very tasty the room be spacious and clean the resort have a bar also on the ground as well the good part be the service i find the service to be superb and very quick every staff member be ready to make our stay comfortable in all possible manner to watch out this resort be a club for Palm Meadows community initially we be a little disappointed when we find this but then realise that this be not an issue and we can still enjoy it like a resort a bit expensive but then this be a premium resort so ok Will be plan our stay here again Everything be perfect the hotel the room the staff the pool and spa the food it be my first trip to India and i could n t have ask for a nice experience in a nice environment Particular mention go to Raghanvendra from the restaurant truely excellent waiter Thank you if you be look for a great place to stay in Bangalore and at the same time to have a feeling of be outside Bangalore chao this tick the point however if you want to go to a resort and pick this stay away this be a club inside a very posh society that only few lucky soul can afford to live in so a word of caution if you be just another upp middle clas stretch your budget for this as you may end up regret be in the middle of elite which will put many uncomfortable sup conscious because unlike oth resort where every person be a guest this club be mainly for the resident live in Palm Meadows but open for outsider for short stay i will put the pro con below Pros 1 sup clean club in entirety right from the reception to room and all facility 2 Great pool set up i have ever see 3 Nice hospitality as guest be treat well any issue with room be attend to super fast 4 if you be with Kids i have to mention they will love the kid pool with slide 5 Play area badminton court be very well maintain Cons 1 you will be in middle of Elite crowd resident many from outside India mainly in pool and pool side restaurant which will put you in sup conscious mode unknowingly of think whatever you kid do this be nothing about other around you but just us have awkward outsider feeling inside a society sometime i feel bad to take kid to such a beautiful resort and control them from run around and be naughty 2 order food for Lunch dinner take a good 30min wait in table we have the experience in lunch and then go to mall outside the society for dinner which be very eventful trip 3 except pool playarea and badminton court there be nothing you could do here so stay away if you be not go to get into water you could take a walk around the villa which obviously will have eye watch you as an intruder 4 Food and oth chargable stuff you use from room be price way higher recently stay at Palm Meadows resort on our Marriage anniversary day we have a very pleasant experience Resort be amidst 100 s of international style villa s Complimentary buffet breakfast be very nice recommend for peaceful 5 star resort experience in namma Bengaluru i be here for busines because the company pay i ca n t comment on the level of service for the price pay the pool seem to be the main drawing point of this hotel oth than that wifi promise at the room be abysmal it funny how the hotel manager give the same reply to similar comment before this but no one actually fix it i hope i do n t get ban the next time i come but i really hope they fix the wifi i book well in advance use the hotel s website stay at the club for a weekend i know well in advance that the place especially the pool area and some oth facility be regularly access by the resident of the villa nearby and i be fine with it in fact i d suggest that if you be stay here make it a point to talk to the resident you meet in the share area i come across a bunch of friendly international resident and spend a few hour talk interesting stuff with them the hotel seem to be overstaffed in area that you as a guest will find useless e g a doorman for each wing of the guest building but understaffed in more important area like housekeeping what i find really annoying be that there no free internet you have to pay for it which i fortunately decide not to and then the connnectivity be average poor it just ridiculous to make guest pay for wifi and then deliver them something that barely work i would seriously suggest that management find way to make this a free service the food be good but of variable quality occasionally excellent but sometimes average if the management wish to improve here it not the inherent quality but the consistent delivery all in all a decent place in a superb location surround by a very nice residential area but with patchy service we go to this resort with lot of expectation but the stay be n t great the room be just OK Bathroom be not good and it dint have an health faucet pipe which become difficult for people with kid there be no hot water come and the floor be always wet as the water be clog the room service be horrible every time we place an order they would forget one or the oth thing overall it be n t a great stay my title of the review show my satisfaction Superb staff Immediate attention to the query Food superb BreakFast Lunch and Dinner our favorite Spot swimming pool Main pool kid pool warm pool etc a place in the city still away from the hustle and bustle of the city Nice greenery a pool side dinner great and cozy room good swimming pool lot many sport activity a worthy experience we have go for a corporate team build at this location and find to be quite impressive initially we be a little skeptic about the location as the place be locate in main city near siddhapura unlike oth club or resort in the city this one be part of a gate society the society have its on residential complex and this club be locate right in the middle of it as far as the facility be concern they have everything swim pool basketball tenni court wooden badminton court etc in addition to the above they even have room service spa bar and dining facility they even serve a very sumptuous food with a lot of variety the place be well maintain and be a perfect destination for family holiday and relaxation the good part be that this be locate right in the middle of the city hence there wo n t be any problem relate to reach the place moreover they have adequate parking facility as well one negative point would be that its slightly expensive after the first experience i would definitely would want to try the place again and would recommend the same for other as well one of the fine and well maintain luxury property Amazing management which make sure that their guest be attend with 100 attention good hygiene ethic follow by the staff their outstanding team support have make our trip a rememberable one it be oasi in Bangalore and just the ambience change once you enter the premise Great place and no second thought about it very well maintain and one of the good place in Bangalore Great pool and vast premise which will not allow you to leave the place my husband and i spend the weekend at Palm Meadows locate in a quiet community surround by greenery the garden and recreational complex have something to please individual family and couple the swimming pool be well maintain in addition you can enjoy tenni badminton basketball a fine gym and run trail around the neighborhood the room be very comfortable and clean the food be excellent and the bar and terrace provide a friendly place to get together with friend there be also a nice library to catch up on work and reading we come from Delhi for a wedding reception and we appreciate the quiet excellent air quality and sense of tranquility although we have plan to do some local sightseeing we be all too content at Palm Meadows and so we spend the weekend there as i be write this review i be about just check out from the resort namely the palm meadow club whitefield bangalore truly speak it do n t feel like go back we have come to

the whole property be well maintain and extremely clean i really enjoy this calm hideout after long buzzy day visit our development center in Bangalore the sleep be excellent cause of good bed and no traffic noise the hotel be locate deep in the gate community and be a real bles Walking distance to restaurant and shopping center outside the community the garden and pool area be clean and well trim Nice breakfast that could be eat outside Only thing that need improvement to be a perfect busines hotel be the wireless connection no coverage in the room and not expect bandwidth in oth area Small thing that should get prioritise by management over all a good experience i will be back and hope to be able to be connect next time Palm Meadows Club be a very nice place in Bangalore the service be excellent great food and confortable room i do n t have a chance to try the pool area but it look quite inviting the staff make a real effort to make you welcome and have a good experience during your

Palmyra be very good with excellent food and impressive service we take walk in the residential area in the evening it be peaceful and enjoy it thoroughly Thank you for such a nice experience stay at Palm Meadows with extended family for one night overall a pleasant experience and a good option for some quiet time with the family inside the city Few Pros 1 the Swimming pool be awesome for that matter the property have more than 4 5 different swimming pool all well maintain the Kids pool with the slide be an awesome one for the kid to enjoy 2 the room be well maintain clean Most all room have a Balcony but do not expect any great view the good you can get be the view of the layout outside the resort which be a well maintain road and house 3 the breakfast spread be good though not great the south indian delicacy be nice 4 the Badminton court kid play area and oth game area be well maintain too the surprise be the Library which be an awesome place for some quiet time the wooden finish of the room give a calm feeling to grab a book and skim read Cons 1 the check in experience be not very smooth have issue produce ID card for the senior citizen in the family the problem be the way the Manager lecture as if i be catch drunken driving than provide option of how this can be handle Expect more professionalism 2 mosquito be a problem Do not plan to have evening snack near the Pool though it be very tempting way too many mosquito you nee to fend off 3 during Breakfast if you be bank on some live count stuff think again at least i do n t find the chef when i want to i visit on long weekend check in on 30th April on Sunday n check out on Monday 1st May 2017 i be lucky to be there on Sunday and witnes the crowd that come in for Sunday brunch buffet which be not the case on oth day of the week Room be good and have AC and clean and pretty washroom food be also good the surround be neat and quiet as it host only luxury Villas and only villa resident most of them be foreigner and hotel resident visit the club Spa be ok ok my wife i stay in Palm Meadows Club for two night on 29th 30th April 2017 in a pool face room on first floor with a great view of a lawn flowering tree plant just outside the balcony the room be very clean very well maintain with excellent quality furniture crisp well washed bed linen towel also top rate bath room fitting the breakfast especially on Sunday morning be a huge spread the quality of each every item be sup the ala carte menu items be it Indian or Continental or Chinese be very tasty also with good portion although a bit

Gents Ladies these be also well maintain there be a well equipped gym two tenni court 3 badminton court all with prop upkeep Lot of greenery around with lawn flower plant tree properly water regularly all the staff at the reception house keeping maintenance restaurant even security be very well trained each one be always smile ready to go out of the way to help although this resort be locate in the thick of the urban concrete jungle on Vartur Road surprisingly once inside it be as if you be away from the city with no sign of any disturbance may be because it be quite a distance from the main road be surround by spacious row house of Adarsh Builders the only problem especially for traditional Indians be the absence of health faucet in bath room the only option of toilet tissue Amazing place to stay excellent lovely and friendly staff Good breakfast especially English breakfast a must visit place will recommend to my friend family and colleague Home away from home this be my third visit to this resort and i be not disappointed the resort have maintain their high standard of cleanlines friendly staff and good service it have a cosy bar open swimming pool and spacious gym do nt feel like bangalore once you enter the palm meadow colony the palm villa all around and the resort locate in the centre Everything be nice the room the pool the activity like the tenni shuttle court we enjoy the steam bath and the sona one bad thing be there be a lot lot of mosquito because of which we could not enjoy the evening time else i would have definitely rate 5 star this hotel have a good location away from the Bangalore traffic here you can hear bird singe the service of the staff be wounderfull the room be Clean and modern the pool area be fantastic Love it the area be nice and calm Large pool area which on weekend be frequently use by family from around the area Multiple language speak and a nice familiar atmosphere the food be great and diver when you get too home sick you can sink your tooth in a good burger for instance the staff speak perfect English and be very helpful and accommodating busines wise the WiFi be totally clogged during the evening in the room not a chance to even watch your e mail some work could be conduct early in the morning when the load be less a lot of noise go on in the middle of the night in the hallway and since there be stone floor everywhere the noise travel all the way through the door and in to the room since i m a light sleeper this make it hard for me to get a good night rest all in all pro and con sum up i will definitely go back here next time i visit Bengaluru i have stay multiple time at this lovely club house it be an oasi of quiet hide in a private secure estate in the Whitefield area of India s Silicon Valley Good food at the bar and restaurant pnly downside i can mention be they have stop serve Kingfisher and be now serve foster oh dear room be very large with a well equipped clubhouse large pool gym and restaurant this hotel be inside an ex pat community and be keep far from the noise of the street it be very peaceful and the staff and service be good the Oak Tavern pub be very relaxing with a decent

strike me as i enter my room be how the bed be align to FACE the large picture window as against the usual norm of parallel to the window this be a spectacular idea and i wonder why more hotel even within the group do n t take this cue the bed itself be super comfortable with a wonderful mattres perfumed bed sheet and super comfortable pillow in spite of all this i be reluctant to go to sleep because i be enjoy lie on bed and look out of the window so much the oth highlight be the buffet spread which i have for lunch it cover a wide range of cuisine start from chat and go across Indian western and oriental cuisine each of which be tasty and enjoyable finally even think the restaurant be very crowded during breakfast and i be alone the steward who attend me be very attentive and

Properties in India over the year and have never experience even a tad of discomfort any time taj be synonymous with the word hospitality however i have a gut feeling that they be slip in the standard when i visit this place i land at 1145 at night after a grueling day at work and a late night flight from Mumbai then a patient drive from the airport in Bengaluru s famous traffic i go to the reception desk and be ask to give my photo identity after that i be ask the most stupid question ever do you check in the afternoon why would someone check in twice in a day then i be tell that my room be take they would check since they be run a full house my expression must have be adequate for them to scamper and i be finally give a room the room and the amenity be top clas Next day the usual hospitality return and the restaurant staff be very nice i be there to attend a conference and the lunch be serve on the lawn which have uneven surface and fly on the food this be our first

comfortable room the even number room seem to have a well view though the staff be very helpful would like to mention Abhishek from the front office who be helpful only drawback its right on the main road so as soon as you step out its polluted as hell well lay out buffet with lot to choose from outstanding dessert selection and a very nice sushi offer too this buffer be worth the money if you have a few hour to spare over a leisurely lunch when you hear about Taj hotel certain thing like friendly staff great room excellent food be a must and this hotel be no exception to this criteria have a wonderful time there Choose the room with city view have a good time there Would definitely come again here always a pleasure to get back here Great and comfortable stay as always compliment to the

Pallete to Misba at room service sorry if i miss other once again thank you and will look forward to our next visit there be a certain conception one have of Taj properties and boy do this property disappoint wholeheartedly the level of service be extremely third rate when i check in at 10 pm there be one person man the front desk counter Check in itself be quick and seamless the room be an absolute shocker with the most bizarre layout i have see the whole Hotel have an extremely unkempt and run down feel right down from the elevator door which have dirt mark on them to the key card which look atleast a 100 year old the water amenity place in the room also look old unfortunately the Hotel have lose sight of the fact that the devil lie in the detail so far as guest experience be concerned the quality of the coffee shop be abysmal both day i go in to eat breakfast i be not greet or direct to a table on the first day i be nt even give cutlery on my table and the server forget to lie out any table napkin the cutlery be old the plate and glass be dirty to touch no care be give to presentation and guest be serve food drink in stain utensil the spread be really POOR for a Hotel of this calibre and top it all the fruit on display look rotten this be my first visit to any Taj property in India and this have certainly demolish the hallowed reputation of this brand for me Trust the Taj Corporate Team be look very closely on the performance of this Hotel one bad hotel can ruin the year of legacy guy PS Pritom from Front Desk who take my check out be exceptional Special shout out to him for somewhat redeem the service here it be osm to be in Taj and have some party in shimmer we really enjoy a lot the ambience and the guest service be osm but unfortunately we lose our vehicle key and the quality of food and drink we get there be just osm i prefer to go there regularly we decide to go out for brunch this past Sunday Thats a pretty big scene in Bangalore we have have a few folk mention the brunch at the Yeshwantpur Taj as it be only a couple of metro stop from us we decide to try it we be not disappointed even though we end up not get there until about an hour before they be to shut down everything be still hot cold as the case may be dish nicely display plenty of food and the staff be so very helpful mainly we interact with Shivangi and Ganesh

Experience be very good Hotel Environment be peaceful room be good and service be also Fast i like the room and the ambience of the hotel the front desk people be nice and helpful during the check in and check out probably the decor near the reception and waiting area can be improve a bit more as its a Taj hotel the restaurant food be nice during the dinner and breakfast however the service can be improve as it take a while for someone to attend and ask if anything be need by the guest the swim pool area can be improve as well the corridor lead to the room can have some aroma to give a fresh feeling overall have a good experience and will remember this hotel in my memory Taj Name itself give indication of quality somehow i be little bit of disappointed May be i be have high expectation because of the name all be good except few thing incidence which leave bad taste the Shower area in the room be n t design properly and water be leak out while take shower that be why i have give 4 star the facility be nice and the food be good due to AeroIndia show they charge 430 USD per room but we have no choice when we check out they try to double charge us and this leave a very bad taste i be a very Happy Client have very pleasant 2 day official trip and staff be brilliant front desk to the House keeping Clean room Atmosphere even though it s in the middle of a busy city i will

exuberance attitude be what distinguish the Taj experience Thank you team Taj we have a very good family outing staff be courteous great facility and wonderful location Swimming pool GYM and SPA be awesome the home theater in the room be another addition Breakfast be too good with too many option we have book for an overnight stay to celebrate my birthday i do not get the room booking offer on my birthday it be rather offer to suit the weekend staycation offer the very next day of my birthday hence i could not complain to celebrate an extra day on my birthday at Vivanta by Taj Yeswantpur the customer service be rather slow especially if you be book through the hotel s central reservation line the hotel have no direct telephone facility to make reservation inquiry but be redirect through a toll free number i have to make at least four call to actually get a line to talk to Taj Yeswantpur front desk this be something the hotel need to improve a guest can not be make to wait for long or put on hold when seek a hotel specific query we have request for a 24 hour stay but the offer be only for 11 be to 12 pm basi Taj could have offer us 24 hour stay at least with my birthday as a reason nevertheless i be not complain as i be very happy the way i be pamper on my birthday during my stay Entry to the hotel be smooth with mandatory security screening of baggage the Hotel be locate very conveniently next to Gorguntelpalya Metro Station and at a walk able distance from Yeswantpur Railway station the front desk staff be busy but complete the require procedure smoothly Chek in be smooth and the room be very spacious with a pool view the room have all the good amenity and importantly completely noise free Complimentary drink upon arrival be offer we be then offer my complimentary birthday cake for celebration in the room itself and we enjoy it very well Staycation offer be club with a complimentary dinner and breakfast the Restaurant be very busy with the many guest on a weekend and we have a sumptuous dinner with Kerala Special dish on offer for the day Staff member be very courteous but the space be not adequate and we find it difficult to move at ease due to the crowd and space crunch the Restaurant should take step to expand its space to accommodate more guest especially on weekend Gym spa and pool facility offer be excellent the buffet breakfast offer on the next morning be again highly excellent with wide range of continental North Indian and South Indian dish offer Coffee be offer in wide variety of brewing choice the space opposite to the restaurant have an open air theatre early morning performance under the huge tree by a reputed flautist it add a charm along with sipping of a coffee our stay end with a light snack offer in the room and our chek out proces be again a smooth i be even give a surprise gift by the front desk staff upon chek out for my birthday the only suggestion for the hotel be to offer a complete 24 hour stay at least upon guest s special request occasion by club the offer it be also suggest to provide direct reservation tele booking facility instead of wait for a hold transfer from centralized toll free number Email response too should be quick Wonderful Hotel Great Service Food be Delicious it be my first visit to this place and they do not disappoint Housekeeping be lightne fast give them a call for service and you wo n t have to wait long hat off have to stay for 7 day and the experience we very pleasant with a clean and comfortable environment my suggestion would be to ask for a room on the pool side of the hotel to not get the noise that be from the intersection below Have visit there last month stay almost for 3 day though it be busines trip but the treatment be wonderful the Spa offer be almost like cherry on the cake get fully relaxed it be enthral moment the Housekeeping Manager have show their concern and ask to each individual about Hotel service and ask to order for the anything oth than the Buffet menu that be so touchy the staff be so soft spoken and well mannered Thanks and all the good Proud personnel Non response from senior manager and non importance of satisfaction from them i do not recommend this hotel the most important dissatisfaction with how the personnel be treat there busines do not take me here since 2013 i be back to my hotel of choice for

issue the event management company seem to be under staffed for handle the huge number of customer the booking be carry out online through three different site and there be confusion on the customer

fine the event with DJ music Fashion show singing and food be great there be a separate area for kid with nanny to take care of them but the entertainment in the kid room be not upto mark i e there be just a projector screen run Jungle Book movie some tattoo make person puppet show and that be it the kid be get bored and we take them back with us but in the end it prove better as they enjoy dance with us till the NYE 2019 countdown all in all a relishing enjoyable experience to be cherish for a long time Hotel be great very clean and tidy only problem be the staff be not helpful at all wake up

busines my company book a room with correct company name and GST number at the time of check out i find the company name and the GST number be wrong in the invoice i request to correct it to the right one they say it will be correct and the new correct invoice will be send by email since then myself and my secretary be request to give me the correct version it have pass more than one month still they can not give me the correct invoice this be like a hell i would never come back to this place the hotel be what you expect from a Taj property first clas the customer service be also great but what i find exceptional be my experience at breakfast i go to the buffet and it have a great spread they be serve uppama and i remember how my mom would make roast egg curry to go along with the uppama when i be young think it be a long shot since there be already so much being provide i still ask if the chef would be able to make some roast egg and the sous chef Sayed come out and ask a few question then go back to the kitchen within 15 minute he come out with a delicious serving of roast egg it be fantastic almost as good as the way my mom make it Sayed then come back to ask how it be i enjoy the breakfast and i really appreciate that this chef would go beyond what be require of him the friendly courteous and speed of service matter a lot when i be away from home and on busines Taj be excellent and i would rank as with best in this regard the breakfast have on offer a wide choice room be always clean Gym be well equipped and the friendly instructor ever willing to advice visit Taj Yeshwantpur in November first week 2018 the staff be very courteous and helpful love the stay of 4 day Food be awesome specially love the bissebeli bhat we visit their restaurant paranda for

cheerfulnes Nothing seem like too much trouble and they genuinely seem dedicated to give the guest a pleasant stay the food in the buffet restaurant where i have breakfast and dinner be excellent my room be at the back and have no external noise at all but friend who have room at the front report heavy traffic noise price of room vary enormously with the day of the week and method of booking so care be need to get the good rate this hotel be overrate the check in experience be below par for a hotel with a five star tag and above average rating on all online booking platform the staff seem distant unhelpful and somewhat unfriendly there be one constant query i be bombard with when will you check out sir when will you check out this question be throw at me at least 3 time in a span of less than 5 minute it almost seem as if they be reluctant to even host me at the hotel i pay the entire room tariff r 5999 in advance and by the time i reach the room i be already in a mood to get out of this place as soon as possible i check out in less than 10 hour and decide never to come back to this hotel to be fair and not generalize i must mention that the duty manager do call me back and follow up on my concern a kind gesture 2 day ago also the room be very good however i ca n t embellish my review base on that my overall experience be below par stay here for a night during a work trip Lovely ambience Great room Great staff that why it take Breakfast have a good spread Special mention for the spa Awesome place for a massage if i remember the therapist be Aruna stay here for 2 day and later for one more day come from Frankfurt and go back to Frankfurt we enjoy room breakfast bar and spa Everything be very well we will come back and keep it in good memeory Excellent Feel

a huge disappointment for the quality of the service the hotel be a piece of art but the service be below average and the staff be inattentive Restaurant Services be unexpected from Taj in my opinion its be lack of training and supervision many good experience can be spoil with one bad experience and your cliental have potential to come back and spend so do n t ignore them and do n t take them too easy this my 7th visit to this Taj Property Yesterday Evening have take a CEO of a Chinese corporation the guest be stay at the hotel 1 when we enter the restaurent nobody to usher us or attend to us 2 the restaurent hardly have any guest but the staff look super busy and unattentive 3 we have to find our own seating then a lady come and ask our room number not sure why she be so eag they have no

an amazing experience at taj just love it Everyhing be amazingly organised for us for on first anniversary celebration the balloon cake and everything Honour of light diyas on departure be really good thank you Massive grand and yet homely be what i d sum up this place as i ve stay here so many time and day in just two month that it almost personalised service now from airport transfer to choice room personally prefer the pool and East face room than look at the serpentine queue of vehicle on the road 24 7 to the filt coffee with breakfast the room be supremely comfortable and the multiple single touch choice of lighting be just one aspect that go to show the attention to detail for the musically inclined there be a regular pianist in the lobby and a flautist in the centre garden who be more than thrilled if you be the type who love soft instrumental music the only crib i ve about the place be the bloody crazy pricing of food and drink in a place like Bangalore and Yeshwantpur due to which you can regularly see guest either walk out to nearby eatery or order food delivery through app even if the company pay these rate feel ridiculous sorry Take for example spend INR1100 for a sandwich and filter coffee i pay less at a Dubai 5 but that apart i ve make this place my second home and completely love wake up to see the sunrise through the full width glas wall hit the gym or pool to sweat it out and then totally devour the grand breakfast and see the smile and attentive staff on the way in and out a 4 5 5 with the deduction only for the price of food and drink Drop a 10 12 and i ll make that a 5 5 PS Special mention for Sujay at the Restaurant and Nikhil at the Travel desk with a big thank i have a very pleasant and comfortable stay at Taj Vivanta i be very tired and forget to give laundry doze off i ask the staff on call if i could give my laundry then 1830 hr i receive my laundry by 2230 it be amazing love it the female staff take order on call be very courteous and helpful thank a ton i love the hotel service staff and location Easy acces and great service very polite staff and extremely helpful Lovely comfortable room and great pricing i prefer this hotel over Sheraton thats right next to Brigade Tower the overall ambience and the service provide be state of art in the segment Space usage within room cleanlines toiletry and of course food all meet with the expectation from TAJ family Great go Keep it up the Taj Yeshwantpur be one of the modern Taj hotel in the country you have great interior in the room adept with modern look infrastructure the

the switch board be interesting to use and give you an experience of automate room the interior be very well plan with good attention be pay to lighting the design i the room and bathroom the only drawback the wardrobe open and close in a way where kid may end up have their finger stick that may have to be look at by the hotel a special mention for the view from the room the view from the room be stunning we be on floor 11 make the view even more Breakthtaking we take the city view room and could see the greenery of Bengaluru on one side and the metro the flyover and the traffic on the oth side make you look at both side of the coin in one view Nature and the modern man make mayhem Fantastic the Reception checkin and checkout proces be quick the food at Taj be unquestionable as always Fantastic food they have a very cool all Day Breakfast Menu that you must try totally worth the money the swim pool be outdoors on the second floor and make for a fabulous view it be surround by

comfortable the whole hotel doesnt seem like super crowded which be nice also the room be very clean and organized everyday when i come back from work the breakfast area be nice and big with a very good food offer Only flaw have be that i have to ask for coffee 3 time during both stay which be a bit annoying in the morning oth than that i can definitely recommend the stay here the location be

pleasant the ambiance be also very good and breakfast be awsome we have an office offsite meet in Taj Yeswantpur we stay for 2 night and 3 day the climate be initially hot in Yeswantpur but it rain in

sauna and steam bath extend our BLR stay to enjoy the spa and pool at Taj Yeshwantpur the experience be refreshing blissful and rejuvenating the Jiva Spa be outstanding room very comfortable and pool very relaxing of course the Taj warmth and F B look forward for the next therapy its a new property a posh one look from the city view room at this hotel you will realise how big Bangalore have grow over the year the Metro next to the hotel make it a good option for folk to stay here and then take metro to Orion or Manthri mall it look like there be more busines traveller in this hotel than any vacationer but that ok the pool area be nice calm and peaceful it be company meeting property and accommodation but food quality specifically Paneer item be bad oth service etc be good Good arrangement of meeting anyhow it be avg rating from my side it be as usual a very comforting experience at Taj Group Hotels the hotel be at an ideal location and the Breakfast and overall food be sumptuous the room be very comfortable and the staff be very courteous Location be often important for a hotel in India due to traffic congestion and delay this hotel be n t close to downtown Bengaluru but it within reasonable reach from the downtown as well as from some remote location such as the airport and BIEC fairground it stand on a major highway next door to a metro station so that most of the time you have several transportation option reach the hotel on foot be hardly feasible otherwise its location be very practical all around room be spacious and well furnished with attention to detail unusual for India there be still some minor quirk and malfunction in detail which probably would n t answer to 5 star expectation of some guest but for India this hotel be very good all around for example it nice have an ironing board in your room give that both the room be large and its storage area be spacious to easily accommodate an ironing board almost every detail in room and bathroom area be do well there a well function wi fi both in room and in the lobby area in room there be many power socket for your equipment with Tumkur Road be a major highway all floor be a little bit too noisy around the clock the room be soundproofed but perhaps not enough get room on a high floor and rearward to the road should help this matter a little bit Food in restaurant and for in room dining be OK and reasonably diverse for those who would dislike an all Indian menu again it rather not 5 star level still you re get a pretty good price quality ratio in this matter if your expectation be not at the very top of the quality side do n t have time to use their pool spa area so no opinion there it look somewhat small though otherwise all service and feature at this place seem very satisfactory i stay at the hotel Taj Yeshwantpur during a busines trip the hotel be locate far from the core of the city but the interior be really well do and its pretty spacious as well the lobby room and the hotel be beautifully design i be allocate a pool face room and the view from the room be really nice the staff be courteous and the hospitality at the hotel be superb also they have a buffet breakfast and spread be huge all in all a really good hotel and totally worth a visit whenever you plan to stay in Bengaluru very good hospitality from all staff i enjoy every minute of my stay very dedicate staff from front desk to travel desk housekeeping and for sure the resturant include international and Indian variety of food and Sunday brunch in the garden that be a must to try it be very nice hotel with friendly staff during my stay the hotel name be change from Vivanta by Taj to Taj Yeshwantpur some front desk personnel be not responsive to your requirement during my 4 week stay i encounter frequent power failure the air conditioner fail twice in two different room room in the front of the building be very noisy Food quality be average Hope we ll see improvement after the hotel be change to Taj we stay at Taj Yeshwantpur during our Southern Sojourn last week it be my birthday week and the GRE Veena ensure a warm welcome with a decorate room with balloon with cake and cookie as a personal welcome it be heartfelt and truly Taj stamp on that lovely gesture the room be comfortable the bath amenity the good Taj have source in recent year love the smart quote on the amenity cover the boy have a great time swim in sweltering heat the food be the highlight of the trip Dinner be a southern spread along with continental dish in the buffet menu at the coffee shop the sweet delicacy range from Indian sweet to blueberry cheesecake the breakfast spread be elaborate with Indian and continental dish pipe hot Idlis and sambhar be our choice of course Will add picture of food and hotel over the weekend we miss spend some time under the great Banyan Tree in the courtyard but there will be another visit for that thank you for a wonderful stay Team Taj Yeshwantpur Excellent place go for lunch couple of time with friend very peaceful Excellent service Great restaurant great food Good place for family and busines lunch Keep up the standard Love to go back this be a great place to stay for all busines traveller to the IT hub Bengaluru Location comfortable room good breakfast spread and JIVA spa be the pro there be minor irritant like issue with TV swipe machine not work near room etc but all be very much manageable Bottle neck arrival road need a welcome drink which be not provide even after request Service at restaurant very good and food be great they be all professional and polite but very busy hotel seem full of something happen all the time Special thank to room boy and guy at the arrival door include security room be lovely spacious clean no tub in our room but shower be warm and with adequate force i m happy Hotel be very good food be excellent house keeping be also very good Sanno Guest Relation Executive be very good she sanno be very help nature i strongly recommend this hotel very good staff and service thank Weekend getaway to this hotel turn out to be extremely delightful experience i have not anticipate Beautiful property Great room and Excellent Services Housekeeping guy Tamil do a wonderful job in help me find some relief from sore throat Jiva Spa experience be an icing on the cake Peaceful Calm and soothing to mind Felt like home Would recommend this hotel to everyone who be look for a peaceful stay in bangalore its an hour s distance from airport which be a relief consider bangalore traffic if you be travel for Convention this be undoubtedly the good hotel in Bengaluru near to the convention centre excellent comfortable room great breakfast and yes Taj hospitality just love it the hotel room be clean and spacious Be advise that due to security reason they be require to come in and clean your room daily despite personal preference the breakfast be great and location be convenient very close to the Metro the one hiccup in our stay be that we be incorrectly charge for a spa visit we speak to several individual over the phone and there be some inconsistency as each time we call no one know what we be talk about ultimately the manager be very apologetic when it be determine that the charge be incorrect when we ask for write confirmation of our refund i e scratch out the charge on our hotel bill the individual we speak to at the front desk be extremely condescending about this simple request after the confusion over the phone it be understandable why we would want write confirmation as staff do not appear to be communicate with one another but instead this individual imply we be accuse them of cheat us and tell us to trust him which be ironic consider they do n t immediately trust us when we tell them we never go to the spa instead conduct a full investigation and review their video even now we do not have write confirmation that they will take off the nearly 5 000 rupee charge from our bill to avoid such situation in the future we suggest use the room key itself to verify visit to the spa and restaurant as they only ask for room number and no oth information anyone could say any room number result in these type of charge oth than this our stay be comfortable and we be grateful to the majority of hotel staff housekeeping and room service the location of the hotel be very nice and room be good the hotel be old but well maintain the bar in the hotel be very nice with live singer i enjoy my stay and the staff be very cooperative the gym be good and the spa in the hotel be very nice the bathroom be bit small and the room size be ok just check ot of a 3N stay from Taj in yeshwanthpur Cons 1 New property beautiful ambience 2 close to metro and taxi cab etc usually available easily 3 room be huge and comfortable Cons sorry these outweigh the pro 1 Nothing here remind us of the Taj service Staid lacklustre unwilling to do the basic courtesy of smile greet by most of the staff esp front desk n Pallets restaurant have stay for a staycation in Taj hyderabad just recently and the experience there make us expect similar alas only to be disappoint this time 2 one of the day we take a metro connection and walk over to the Property on our 2nd day only to be rudely ask off by the security person outisde 3 for some reason the ask service on the first day get all our response wrong ask for a bucket and we receive a blanket 4 always have kid around while have breakfast n not once do anyone offer to hold the plate or bre over something post a separate review on TA 5 the only people who greet well and enquire abt the stay n comfort be rhe spa manager guy with spec find this vey unlikely of a taj property where we have to point out who smile Moms who travel with kid would like some consideration possibly a smile or even a small chat by someone ask if we nee anything if anything need to be customise all this miss at this property our kid be treat like royalty at the hyderabad one the only guy who dint fail be the housekeeping one Buffet spread be limit the room be huge and comfortable but again the bedspread have hole at some place the dust be not clean in the closet Will we stay here hain no its not recommend at all the food quality be pathetic also lot of fraud in billing overall experience of the stay of hotel be bad and can not be tell to anybody a lot of improvement on the food have to be do people be very cordial upto the standard distance from airport be half way to city room be large and decor be very pleasing with Indian touch bathroom be quiet spacious and clean breakfast spread out be amazingly fresh and variety good experience there be some negative review on this place so i be on my guard but my fear be lay to rest Check in be at the blink of an eye the room have a pool view almost an infinity feel from the bed the room have a great and unique design the bed face the window and the cute table and sofa separately in another area mini studio without a kitchen Breakfast huge and the staff be on their own trip you be leave alone unless you ask for something then they be polite and obliging the place be bustle with meet and conference but no disoder or mes the gym be okay pool side nice they have a lovely Italian restaurant and it serve great food house keeping be good we be on the 8th floor the area just before arrive the hotel be a complete bottle neck and traffic can be irritating and they do not give you a welcome drink even if you ask for it i decide to give it a go after i land at Bengaluru on arrival there be a warm welcome and i check in to a room with a pleasant ambience perfectly do for a weary traveller like me Everything be perfectly do from Bed to Shower Only thing that pester me be a huge mirror place on the side of the bed which for unknown reason make me quite uncomfortable Beautiful hotel with helpful staff Would like to mention some name of staff who be very helpful and attentive to guest Mr tripathi housekeeping Ms Kavita Mr Srikanth Mr Chandan Spa Mr Arun F B the place be inside the city area Easy to identify as its on the main road and very close to WTC at the entrance we be receive with a great hospitality the room be amazingly clean Bathroom be really large and very comfortable Appreciate the Staffs for their wonderful gesture towards the guest especially one at the entrance who be very helpful name start with P the view from top floor be really awesome Nice swimming area Good food Overall experience be excellent those who generally come to Bangalore for Exhibition this place be very perfectly and conviniently locate ove and above the locatin the staff be very courteous and food be good the room be reasonably spacious and very neat and clean Would definitely like to stay during my next visit the hotel be a good property and have maintain the Taj etho well however because it bang on the the main road the facility that face the flyover and road especially room have noise peep as early as 4 be in the morning which be a little annoying over excellent facility for a 1 2 day busines trip this hotel be a gem and very well run the staff be truly friendly and helpful the room be very nicely appoint and of a large size the pool and gym be also very good Breakfast be of excellent quality and have a large selection i would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back in the near future this hotel be get old and need to renovate everything this be a conveniently locate to visit the Bangalore International Exhibition Center where many international trade fair be conduct but the hotel have bold and need to renovate the service be good and the food above average Service from staff be very friendly and efficient Bed be comfortable and room have modern amenity the bathroom could be clean and the wall on the hallway nee to be paint it be a bit run down tile in the shower be moldy and the towel be old and not good quality Nice big place locate at not so good location as it be surround by highway and traffic the ambience be good with lovely atmosphere the variety in the buffet be limited but it be decent and delicious i stay at the Taj Yeshwantpur from Saturday 20th to Tuesday 23rd Jan 2018 while in Bangalore on work this be the first time i be stay in this Taj property and be totally satisfied with the service quality as well as the standard of room and oth amenity i use the spa and the same be excellent too i meet two excellent executive of the hotel at the Front Office during my departure namely Sahil and Soumyadip who be extremely pleasant and helpful i recently stay 16th and 19th Jan 2018 at this hotel for two day and most striking memory i have be the courteousnes and super friendly front desk manager Mr Abhishek he ensure i and my family have a great stay Taj courtesy never fail i gues the food we host couple of friend for dinner the menu the Palette be fab again my 3 year old kid who be fussy eater get be food cook just the way request one more reason i definitely prefer stay at Taj Hotels when i travel with family as comfortable and courteous as home if you be look for the Taj standard of comfort staff courtesy graceful and pleasant welcome staff then this be not the hotel for you if you be ready to sit for hour wait for your room and the staff to not even bother for the discomfort u face then this hotel be your good choice the most plastic face staff non responsive to your query or every person give a different story every time and all this even when you be visit on your birthday and be a higher rank Taj Innercircle member if this be how they treat their loyal guest or innercircle member then god know how they treat regular walk in this hotel be just not a Taj standard i come back here after 2 year and already feel its a big mistake Should have definitely explore oth hotel not come back here for sure not very often a 5 Star property be able to satisfy a person in al place i do n t feel that there be any improvement need in any direction stay here for a week and enjoy thoroughly each and every day and moment of be here Rooms such luxurious room with ultra comfortable bed and facility i love them all especially the way they have separate the bed and the oth area and how the lighting be control

comfortable sofa to sit and wait for someone although it be quite noisy at time but the complete aura be fabulous Staff and Service now here be something which be good and bad both the staff be very helpful and kind at time but strict and adamant at some i do n t like few instance of my interaction with the staff Service overall be superb and deserve a good score only Pool and Gym situate on the second floor they be well maintain and design properly one can have a full workout and no need to mis on your schedule the Gym be open till 9 but on request they may open for late also and same be with the swimming pool the swimming pool be beautiful and one can have a great time dip there Restaurants i be big foodie which be the reason why i keep judge hotel for their food also it be the good breakfast spread i have ever have in any hotel the good part for me be the granola bar which be my 12 pm food option basically oth than that even Shimmer and oth restaurant be also worth a try Banquets and catering since i attend an event i try their banquet also and i must say it be amazing they have some amazing service there and overall the catering be worth mention also especially the open area where the food be be serve you get the feeling of a picnic with the bench and tree around Overall it be an amazing place to stay and have a good time i would love to visit them again many a time Taj by Vivanta locate at Yeshwanthpur Banaglore Nice hotel i book room and later upgrade to suite as i check inn i be inform for my airport drop and breakfast because i have early flight next day

and TOP notch SERVICE the front office staff recognise you very well each time you show up Abhishek be one of the front office staff i always remember and he be very cordial and friendly we stay at the Taj Vivanta Yeshwantpur for 5 night around the New Year during a family reunion we pick it because it be the close 5 star hotel to our relative home and it turn out to be a great choice it about an hour s drive from the airport and relatively close to the Orion Mall Rajaji Nagar we have a city view suite on a high floor that be spacious and comfortable and we have a rollaway bed wheel in that be surprisingly comfortable as well only r 1000 per night for an extra guest in addition to the two book the service be excellent we do n t get a chance to try the restaurant for dinner but breakfast be really good a lot of choice for both Indian and western option the New Year s day breakfast spread be elaborate and we get a chance to meet and talk to oth guest Internet service for four device with quite decent speed we do n t nee to upgrade to the premium service option more device high speed Laundry service be a tad expensive but very convenient and immaculately handle Wish we have something like that at home in the US the hotel be locate at a busy intersection Goreguntapalya Metro station NH 75 The Outer Ring Road and it can be sometimes challenging to get an Uber driver to navigate correctly to the hotel when they re come from the wrong side the suite have two temperature control one for the bedroom and the oth for the oth side which be locate in a strange position near the floor and i do n t realize it be there until a day or two have pass the electric kettle for morning tea coffee be quick and convenient and the kitchen area be always keep well stock with lot of complimentary bottled water no nickel and dim on this necessity luckily the bathroom be well lay out and spacious lot of hot water at a good pressure we enjoy the stay and would definitely stay here again i have not be to India for many year so i be look forward to my stay in Bengaluru the hotel do not disappoint in any way a relatively new building on a main road out of the city and with an adjacent metro station the hotel be large well appoint and the room be spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished i be in a relatively high floor room so have great view across the local area the shower be great with nice hot water as require Housekeeping be efficient and little thing like placement of electric socket by the bed and at the desk be some of the good i have see in any hotel room Breakfast be good and i be able to have my simple favourite of bacon porridge and a bit of toast i sleep so well on day two that i oversleep and miss breakfast Problems None with the hotel the usual worldwide attempt by the airport taxi to rip me off by claim his meter be not work and that the fare would be 2000 rupee i soon get that little problem sort out by tell him if his meter be not work he should a not be ply his trade from the airport he be one of the Airport Taxis and b he better take me back to arrival so i could get in a taxi with a working meter One we get back he surprise surprise reveal that his meter be in fact work Total cost around 800 and that be after a long deliberate diversion into the city centre the guy seem to be too dumb to work out i be watch where he be go on my Smartphone so have switch to Uber for travel every oth day the application force pick up from the nearby Metro Station not the hotel one for the hotel to sort out with Uber as a result of this glitch it take over 35 min and three different driver to get one who could understand through phone call from the helpful hotel staff to come to the hotel if you have busines or purpose to visit area near Yeshwantpur or Peenya area this be a good option to stay and dine True to Taj s luxury feeling the room be very well do with separate stout and bed area very comfortable bed and pillow Breakfast have a good spread and the food quality be excellent Reception staff and Restaurant staff be very good with their service response i have stay here a few time over the year and like come back Nice well appoint room friendly staff and good facility my only minor grumble be at time the service in the restaurant can be quite inattentive but when you realise that the same staff do breakfast lunch and dinner i think its fair to cut them some slack Something the hotel management should look at spend a couple of day here with the family the room be well design and quiet ok pool and open area Service be warm and friendly Decent place to stay if you re in town for busines or just want a place of calm be such a long way from home everyone at Taj make us feel at home the hospitality be extraordinary and truly above and beyond Ajit Ajay Armaan Neeraj Ekta Abhay be just some of the staff that greet us every breakfast with a smile and we be fortunate enough to get to know absolutely anything you nee

reputation for its great ambiance and thank for Excon for which i ve decide to stay at this hotel last week it truly one of the good hotel i ve experience in India so far Great service superb room deluxe very good restaurant and above all awesome service it a little far from the airport and take about 40 50 min during office hour but they have another branch close to the airport as well but all the good shopping mall and major office be close to their radiu if you re visit to Bengaluru and not too worried about the room rate i highly recommend Vivanta by Taj at Yeshwantpur very good ambiance for conference Nice courteous staff member Awesome food and restaurant room be very good and the metro view room be charming during the evening time look forward to stay in the near future Good busines hotel long stay for family not recommend as the hotel do n t have any family friendly area it good for busines traveller for short trip it 15 min from key hub like Brigade Gateway Iskcon temple Metro station be opposite to the hotel Hotel offer a lavish buffet breakfast Service be really good a good spacious room that have a separate area for work plus a sofa to relax Sumptuous Food at the restaurant especially Pandara Comfortable Lobby to sit and interact with people the open area be a kind of a big courtyard with table lay out which be great to enjoy the lovely weather at Bangalore i have visit Taj in October for a medical conference the room be good however the check in be n t very pleasant as there be a huge line and the hotel could n t accommodate everyone it take a while for us to get our room however the room and food totally make up for it the live dosa and egg be awesome the room have various function such as relax mode you can charge many device at once our room offer a gorgeous view of the city the bathroom be very clean a bathtub would have be awesome but sadly it be n t there however the rain shower be really good the WiFi have both a complementary and a pay premium package the pillow menu be really a good touch on a whole it be a really good hotel with well groomed and polite staff hey Guys i stay in this hotel for a week in August to be hon hotel room and amenity be decent and good but i dint find any lively atmosphere around Pool and fitnes be the only relaxation area to home on Ambience be nice but service wise thing can be improve little more over all its a value for money stay for one night for busines the hotel be well maintain the room be spacious and comfortable compare to oth Taj property in M G road Bathroom be spacious as well Wifi connectivity be good Air conditioning be effective Italian restaurant serve good delicious food we enjoy it Morning drive to airport be 35 minute but lot of bu truck traffic outside even at 6 30 am be on Tumkur main road it be convenient for us during our return trip from outside of Bangalore Would like to come back its a good busines hotel i stay there on a busines trip for a night only downside be that the hotel be 50 60 min drive from the International Airport that too without traffic they do maintain they Taj branding standard but you may find well option stay for 2 night last weekend its more of a busines hotel than a leisure hotel Crew be good as one would expect from a Taj stable but not as customer friendly and focus as in the 80s i feel they be short staffed at

courteous Food we have taste food from all of the restaurant available in the hotel n all be ok not very wow or awesome Food taste ok service be slow but ok Nothing major to write in room service we order milk for my infant daughter they take atleast 25 30 minute just to deliver that n by that time my daughter have already sleep without have milk in the night so it be extremely disappointing room they be enough big n comfortable with standard coffee tea machine Enough sit place with big bed with good bedding Ours be 901 902 room which be a quite a big walk from the lift Washrooms the reason i give 3 rating there be no sense use while design the washroom its such a big let down there be no water faucet near WC seat we be indian we nee water you have keep 3 4 toilet paper roll but no provision for water do it sound right you be in India n also cater to Indian traveller too why the hell keep one mug nearby without any source of water you expect while do the deed if by chance anyone need more water get up in between go to the basin n get the mug of water this be same problem we face in taj kuteeram too last year in this all the washroom be base on this thinking the guest can have very good service to very good food to good view to whatever good they want but good washroom be basic necessity so after this experience wherever i have visit especially 5 star hotel like your i have notice its only with taj property which have this strange bathroom fantasy oth hotel do think about indian Nothing more to add please share the feedback if you feel worth share i simply adore Taj

staff do not too the order or even look at you or notice your presence for half an hour the service be pathetic so that we have to wait for the simple pickle till our dinner end after one hour they seem unapologetic even after complain and last resort we have to threaten that we will report to GM Taj if they do not pay attention the quality off food be average unlike taj flagship i hope that the name of Taj be build on reputation and they should train their staff aptly the only plus point be its location as it be locate at the heart near many oth place of visit include ISKCON temple Orion

by Mr Abhishek Chatterjee Ms Poonam and Ms Sanno from guest relation this be my first trip to India and i be glad that i stay at this Hotel the staff be warm sup helpful the food and quality of room be exceptional Luxe environment friendly staff great restaurant strongly happily recommend consider that travel in Bengaluru be a pain this hotel be conveniently locate relatively closer to the airport with all possible amenity for a comfortable stay both for busines and leisure traveler well to find another option as this hotel be a very non professional hotel also since it be withe 500 meter to National Highway you ca nt find any alcohol here in room dining and housekeeping service be very slow and poor it be an excellent experience to stay in the hotel Food be very good and the service be also good room be well equipped and comfortable for people travel on busines and as well as for leisure Recommend strongly for stay very happy with service and facility staff member Poonam Shekhwat at front desk be very warm and welcoming and so be pratik they be very cooperative Food be great Gym and pool facility be good host a conference for about 200 odd people be one daunting task that come up in front of us twice every year and this time the venue choose be Taj Vivanta Yeshwantpur an oasi amidst the chao the hotel firstly have fantastic connectivity be just next to a metro station and about a km from the railway station and bu stand the lobby be not huge but have sufficient sofa seating which unfortunately be not too comfortable the lobby lead out to an open space which serve as a dining area and a spillover area for party from the banquet hall next door in between lie the 24x7 coffee shop and restaurant where the breakfast be also serve the room be large and comfortable the comfortable mattres provide us great sleep after a tiring day the bathroom be reasonably large and they have a faucet in the washroom slow applause the staff be quite attentive and we do n t face any problem in host our conference guest enjoy the food as well which be generally very good the breakfast buffet have good option of both global cuisine as well as Indian dish do n t get to explore the oth amenity but it a Taj property and i m sure the standard be very high Good VFM for sure Great hotel with very friendly staff the room be spacious and clean Good bed with a choise of pillow i only have breakfast in the hotel which be good they have a good airport service as well Good Hotel be clean all fitting seem new superb breakfast a lot of variety there be a nice garden restaurant under a tree which be very refreshing i get a city face room and be happy with the room layout u will love their mini office make in the room i m so plan to do it in my bedroom at home Mini bar be well stock with good quality liquor o Bad well it be n t taj standard i expect the linen have ball form on it this happen due to washing so i gues the sheet be well wash the pillow cover be not properly put Room be relatively medium sized 36 sqm to be exact i have to be a little strict to judge a taj i believe because it be an expensive hotel and i expect no mistake my bathroom do n t have a tub the main problem be the miss health faucet i wonder why they do n t put it in spite of be in India and be an Indian hotel chain i m sure the people who do n t wash wo n t face this problem they have provide a tumbler in the bathroom though so it be n t that bad also i order a room service for fish it be n t that great i feel the fish be n t fresh i do n t return it do n t eat it go off to sleep Sad to say that the reception and overall staff attitude be not so friendly and polite the guy at the reception be not well groom also look stoned if u know what i mean i feel weird around the staff the behavior i feel be as if i m do some favour on them by stay at the taj i m sure they should be proud to work there but i believe there should be prop justice to the job Overall i would n t recommend this hotel to an indian with self respect maybe it be n t design for you and you be not expect and welcome here also maybe i expect too much of taj its our second time at this hotel situate though far from center of the city it be one of the good hotel we have stay so far in Bangalore Hotel ambience be just fantastic its staff be totally professional never give us a single chance to complain room be neat and clean have a beautiful view of the city city view room the bath room be well furnished Restaurant be at its good the buffet breakfast have innumerable variety however on last two day of our stay due to ban of sale of alcohol along highway a sign board could be see in the restaurant say no Alcohol bare this the stay be totally enjoy Excellent stay at an affordable price truly great standard maintain by Taj a similar price stay at Novotel Ibis or any oth busines hotel be totally not worth it Would highly recommend to any of my friend colleague or relative travel to Bengaluru my stay be pleasant Taj have that human touch in every one who be work there i be so delighted that i leave the hotel with a smile a smile with memory Thank you Taj for a wonderful experience Great service by the staff and make me feel like i be at a home away from home always diligent pleasing and customer obsess i particularly like the way they take care of overall need and provide me with all option before i could ask them the Hotel stay and the expenditure incur there in under the Army Preferential Rates package be an excellent value for money well do however it be request that once free pick up and drop be include in the package from to Airport Railway station as well whilst duration of stay good hotel i ve stay in Bangalore and excellent service as well the food be pricey though but there be plenty of option nearby if you do not want to spend too much near to Orion Mall and Iskon Temple hi i be a regular visitor here each time i have a wonderful experience good quality food and hospitality extremely superb interior whatever the issue or request will be fulfil as early as possible Special thank and appreciation to Mr Sowmyadeep as well as Mr Abhishek Chatarjee also you guy be excellent look for t he good treatment from you in future also thank with Regards Rajesh S the greatnes about good hospitality be that the host never make the visitor feel that he be cause trouble or an unnecessary burden upon them we be at Taj Vivanta for two night book by our company we be there for an event right from the moment we enter we be make to feel as if we be not welcome there be many situation from which i will list a few which make me write this review with this rating the BAD 1 when we be provide with our room and go to the front office to collect our key card upon ask i be tell my room be a twin bed when i enter it be a queen bed upon call the front desk the call be just forward to the relevant person manage the event reservation who be nice but could n t help 2 NOBODY smile or greet be n t this the first rule of any hotel busines when i approach the front office to check out Poonam be in charge as i approach her and inform her that i would like to check out she revert back by say room number i look her in the eye with a smile and wish her Good Morning she stand hard as stone and once again revert back room number i just give up it be not as if this be the middle of the night this be at around 9 AM 3 if that be bad the guy on the night shift be unimaginably horrible on one occasion it be Pritam and Kumardeep i approach them a couple of time and both time they find it hard to open their mouth and they shake their head or use hand to expres their body language be a big let down and everyone be as unfriendly as they come 4 when you call the operator from the room the phone ring and ring before they pick up on another occasion i ask for a single duvet after a couple of call they send us half a rug in a full duvet cover Imagine this even if you consider this a duvet ignore the fact that this be a rug in a cover half the single duvet cover be dangle empty 5 we order coffee to the room it be milky it be sugar milk with a hint of coffee i assume now that i have to ask for black coffee if i want the normal coffee with the coffee on the side with milk and sugar when you charge Rs 700 for a couple of coffee i would imagine the least you do be ask and find out what kind of coffee i nee or at least server the decoction or filt coffee on the side 6 when we arrive we be hungry and go in for a quick lunch from the Indian section we order the Chicken Ghee Roast and Prawn Butter Pepper Garlic we get a sweet sauce base chicken not a hint of either Ghee or Roast and the Prawns be a Thai Malaysian coconut gravy base curry infuse with lemon gras when ask about this the person serve us have absolutely no clue we let it be because whatever serve be delicious 7 the towel in the washroom be completely bald and be in need of replacement the shower cubicle be also miss rubber on the door which seal it in place and we have to wipe the water from the dry area of the washroom the GOOD 1 the Cafe Caramel in the lobby have some amazing treat if you have a sweet tooth the baklava be amazing and the baked Cheesecake be very nice 2 the valet team be an amazing lot they do and be do a great

be not suitable for an average Indian like me it have to be bring down by at least 3 inch for a safe sure comfortable experience when you relieve yourself i have the same experience in Taj Mumbai Taj Krishna in Hyderabad please refer to the advice of DR MERCOLA in this regard the toilet room be flood not really but wet every time you take a shower this be a design flaw in keep shower head near and

and everything be excellent wish all the good very nice place right in the middle of the city and you wo nt notice the hustle and bustle of the city even in the middle of it the vastnes of the place be so nice it make the Hotel lie in a very lonely place the entry to the hotel be not so great although there be a small water fall but compare the luxury inside the entry be quite paltry inside of the Hotel be really amazing even the food that be be serve taste great there be large hall to organise big event and hence our company select this place to hold Devcon event and yearly event for us World clas amenetie as you would expect from Taj really sup room to stay and forget the city traffic but they be quite expensive if you have to pay the price for us company host and hence it be very nice and cozy on the pocket also for alcohol lover out there these guy have some impressive collection of nice old whiskey and brand which you love to have and enjoy Overall great place to be in and spacious room with advanced amenity this hotel be by far one of the good i have stay in the room be very large the hotel have a great pool fitnes centre and spa the staff be very warm and friendly the food be of excellent quality Good experience with family to stay over weekend slightly far from city but good place overall Wonderful big pool and great restaurant too to choose from staff be helpful and well trainer overall have wonderful experience i stay in this hotel for a busines trip it be a beautiful hotel with pleasant staff i be extend a welcome reception with juice flower and upgradation of my room tier because i be privilege Taj inn circle member and also because i book the hotel through Expedia the room be amazing with all amenity extended toiletry and welcome fruit tray and sufficient water bottle Tea coffee maker locker iron table etc as one can expect in a five star hotel it have high speed free wi fi for upto 4 device Big screen HD TV with most of the national and international channel the only concern be its location no nearby place sight seeing mall etc all be very away otherwise also Bangalore traffic be very painful and bad in entire India the public transport like Uber Ola etc be not easily available from oth place though easily available from hotel i have very horrific experience one night though i be on top floor 11th which a purely non smoking but one night at 1 15 AM i start feel strong pungent smell of Bidi local cigaret i be very sensitive to smoking and i could not sleep Upto 1 45 AM i wait if it go away but when it continue i call the hotel reception they spray the whole floor and then i could sleep after 3 AM i do not know if it be some guest or some worker who smoke near the central AC plant but if it be a guest than i be so disappointed that such people can also be so irresponsible and can disturb the entire floor just for their own dirty habit well connected to rest of Bengaluru by road metro Many amenity like metro station hospital mall movie hall be within walk distance the staff at the hotel be courteous helpful and effficient Excellent room with good view comfortable layout Housekeeping too be excellent Several restaurant like Pallette Azure etc to suit your style and taste if you be health fanatic you have gyn swim pool and also heath food at the all day diner Pallette all the staff member have a beautiful smile on their face very cooperative Great stay i book for my child s birthday they give a complimentary cake and chocolate too Buffet breakfast spread be amazing hello people i stay in Taj Vivanta in May 2017 for 3day i have really enjoy my stay in all term of service room the only thing i really din enjoy much be the Food taste which be not spicy i be from Hyderabad and use for spicy food so may be that could be the reason when i say tasty i mean it be not spicy near to Industrial Area Pennya and near to Orion Mall i take a Big room at the 10th Floor the room be big and cozy the only thing which be weird be that there be sound of something crack all night long i do n t know from where do it come from exactly it do n t bother me much Breakfast be nice there be not egg station you can order at your table Staff be really friendly and kind i stay at this hotel for Business for a day i have several meeting round the day and get back to the hotel be a tiring task with the taxi take close to 2 hour in the famous Bengaluru jam i would suggest go for a hotel around MG Road unless you have to go to place nearby this hotel like the World Trade Centre the checkin be easy and fast my agent have book a room with twin bed for me despite me be a solo traveller the hotel accommodate my request to give me a room with a king bed instead the design of the hotel overall and room be modern and the room look really great the area of the room be good with a long work desk i plan a meeting in the room and it go well the bed be comfortable TV have a great collection of channel to suffice anyone the view from my room be great the In Room Dining be the most disappointing part i have dinner and breakfast both in my room i order a vegetarian set meal it arrive in dabna style it be just average and sufficient for a person for the breakfast too i order the set vegetarian breakfast meal the quantity in the same be a lot i do n t think that it could ever be eat by a single person the taste be good but compare it to the breakfast at Vivanta by Taj MG Road it be just average the cloth provide with the breakfast have stain which i do n t expect at all i be in a hurry for a meeting so i just leave hi it be my first stay and i enjoy your hotel the room be clean and spacious i like breakfast you serve but one thing i could not feel good be the noise from the outside the big noise of honk horn start very early like 5 be every day then i give up to be in bed finally during the stay while the view from the window be good you may want to shut out the sound more in case of room face to the road due to this reason i put my score 5 regard Tomomi Tsunoda the Hotel be conveniently locate if you want to finish your work without enter the city close to the airport we have an overnight stay here we be a couple with an adult daughter so we get upgrade to a Suite our flight on day two be late evening so we get an extended check out all this very smoothly and courteously this place be close to Yelahanka and Jalahalli i have be to Vivanta many time for official purpose but this be a special visit as my lovely wife be return back home after 3 week and i need a welcome back cake for her as it be a last minute order i want to give special thank to Mr Kumardeep for look into it personally he make sure that the order be place and deliver well in time special thank to the team for maintain such hospitality i have be stay in this hotel during the last few trip in Bangalore due my meeting which be concentrate in and around North and Northwest of Bangalore the location of this hotel prove to be very convenient and accessible save hour of traffic jam there be a metro station just opposite to this hotel give one flexibility to use metro service during non peak hour the hotel be a newly construct one with beautifully do and appoint large room the size of room be generous and give one enough space to work and relax with nicely appoint furniture like all oth Taj property quality and taste of meal be worth mention Last but not the least the staff deserve a special mention for uphold the Taj service level at all time the only negative i feel be the traffic condition of the road on which the hotel be locate it take 15 20 min for the cab driver to enter the hotel even if it be within 500 mt from the hotel overall an excellent choice for a busines traveller the hotel room be really spacious and well decorate i like the interior and the space available in the room be well occupy by various furniture the TV and music system be also very good the breakfast menu be also vibrant and cover both Indian and continental dish the banyan tree be a very good spot for take photo i be at the Taj Vivanta Yeshwantpur for a weekend of meeting in Bangalore very impressed by the duty manager especially soumyadip and his team at the front desk and the meticulous work and special care show by the team the hotel be at a great location and be very beautifully maintain the food also great the room be good well keep however the food mar the experience in room dining the taste be not good Breakfast food be cold not much attention give to the cleanlines of the cutlery mar the experience of stay in Taj the room next to me be make a lot of noise Sound proof from one room to another be need when you pay so much to have a good night sleep be there for AWS Summit 2017 the place be in the main road just opposite to the Goraguntapalya Metro Great Ambiance Nice Food Ideal for conference and reception it can be split to three room or a whole big conference room the second Vivanta in Bangalore i have stay at i find Vivantas to be comfortable busines hotel this one be a short drive from Brigade Gateway Orion Mall World Trade Center WTC and they have a complimentary hotel shuttle to from WTC the breakfast spread be decent nothing extraordinary the hotel service be good the room be clean and comfortable but the layout be a little unusual especially the table and chair on one of the day i find 100 200 people stand in a long queue try to check in at 7 AM i have never see such a sight at a 5 star hotel that should have be manage better the checkin area be very loud and crazy at that time Overall get 4 star from me since everything be a notch below the good my experience of stay at Vivanta by Taj Bangluru Karnataka be awesome the hotel be at a great location and be very beautifully maintain the food variety be also great overall a phenomenal experience love the stay here nice spacious room and very clean the good be get the evening sun into the room opem the blind fully and you have a brightly light room unlike a dimly lit room even in the day time would love to stay there anyday the overall ambience be good good hotel

in and the service to get the bag across to the room be a breeze the room like most of the oth Taj property be nice and we have ours overlook the Metro line in term of amenity Comfortable in term of size we have take with the King size bed Bed linen Towels etc be all clean our room have a 40 Inch Sony TV with Airtel DTH Taj propoertie equip the room with Iron box with stand and a safe to store your precious item safely and that i find that extremely useful the cabinetary be good the fridge be lock away perhaps because of the liquor ban the hotel do nt expect the guest to use the room have adequate storage wardrobe for your clothe one feedback though be the toilet be nt equip with health faucet and that be a let down during my stay i have dine at Palatte and Paranda restaraunt and do find the food tasty and well make i stay for a night at this hotel my busines meeting location be Brigade WTC and this hotel be very close and convenient to reach within 20 minute after a long day at work Hotel have all amenity and an efficient staff but on the night i stay there be a lot of crowd in the lobby hear that a group be either check out or in either due to the rush they have or as it be a practice the front desk staff or bell desk staff though very polite and courteous do not show the usual courtesy extend in such star hotel chain of take your bag and put it through x ray show you till the elevator if not till the room be absent i do n t have much luggage though so it do n t matter we spend a night here for our anniversary we stay on the 9th floor the room be spacious neat and also have a beautiful view the staff be friendly and polite the hotel be quite clean and worth the money you spend here the breakfast be good with a lavish spread and the al la cart menu be also great

apple pie thing be inedibile the chicken be undercooke etc etc Service at Palette all day dining be sub par but thankfully fresh hot croissant at breakfast apply a bit of balm on that the food at Paranda be FABULOUS and make up for the overall poor dining experience we wait for tea coffee for 30 min at the busines center and in the end leave without it again after pay for it in the board room fee overall a not so pleasant experience this come on the heel of have spend 3 4 day at the Taj Malabar in Cochin which be PHENOMENAL and that make this Taj Yeshwantpur experience even more sour will look for a Taj property elsewhere for our next offsite Location acces to airport be relatively trouble free traffic free compare to the city center location Check in Pleasant smooth and efficient room Comfortable spotlessly clean with a great city view TV have almost all popular channel and good audio system Enough work space and sit area sofa also provide Complimentary Wi Fi have good speed and stable Bathroom Clean and modern Hot water 24x7 however the latrine have no handspray or even a water tap we be in India forgodssake Dining experience this be one area which leave a lot to desire while the presentation and hygiene standard be excellent i will rank food very low on taste department for eg lumpy biriyani bland dosa idli that too offer serve luke warm instead of pipe hot serve Staff at the breakfast buffet also lack the level of competency generally expect from the brand and my famous grouse Mini bar item sell at a punish premium GIVE it a WIDE BERTH its surprising the hotel in Bangalore still commit this sin while the most big brand in Hyderabad have resort to sell them at the usual MRP i recommend this place in north bangalore very friendly staff Nice treatment

nice Hotels i stay in India and the staff be very courteous and helpfull the room be spacious and amenity be good Excellent choice of food and drink the location of the hotel be ideal for a

especially Amit Sarkar Soumyadip Gupta service and food thank you everyone good wish to you all Manish Agarwal i have to say i be expect something better give the Taj reputation and past experience in

consider that the hotel be in India Tea kettle place in box make it very cumbersome to make the tea or coffee i do not know why the hotel have to play western music in the lift or else where when Indian classical music be available i do not hear any Indian music whenever we travel in the west high clas hotel room be big and clean bed in front of the big window face the city view really special

hon service by the entire team make us want to return again again for the good in service food Thank you for pamper us always Poor value for the money pay Location be in out city but nearer to the Exhibition venue the entry to the hotel be too conjested and too much of traffic Food be okay but not many variety to choose towel and bed linen be not tidy and white i stay over at this hotel for three day in Jan 17 the facility be great and the staff efficient a special mention of Mr Hitesh Kumar great spirit and foresight an asset to the Taj Group a thoroughly enjoyable experience it be a busy busines weekend so i do not really get the Taj experience however the staff be really courteous also the only place where i be able to communicate in English if you be unfamiliar with the local language i suggest use Taj cab service and let the staff know to get you a English specking driver hi everyone its really sad that i have to give such a review for a Taj property but its true we stay for 3 night at the Taj vivanta yeshwantpur and it be aweful the service be horrible for example we order a biryani at 10 45 pm which reach to our room at 1 am the breakfast layout be bad and i mean it which be not at all expect from such a reputed property who qoute room rate which be sky high now i along with my family will never book any Taj property after such an experience which be far below normal standard it be a pleasant and excellent week end stay after a busy month Perfect place to relax with some real nice experience at SPA and pool the property can be a good place for large busines event as it be spacious and vey well connected to all major location in the city well build hotel at a good location over price room for a weekday stay FO staff give 0 info about the what the hotel have to offer robotic service Breakfast spread be good but quality poor Expect well service from the Taj there be note great to write home about an ok Taj property with mid size room lethargic service and ok food the staff attitude at the hotel be sub par unlike oth Taj property my room s shower drainage be choke its a 4 hotel breakfast be varied but the service be not upto mark had to wait for long to order the main dish which be not on the buffet probably because the place be crowded it seem they have wedding guest and also the international convention guest together this also make the lobby very crowded and noisy the room be very good Only thing be that i be constantly disturb by the housekeeping keep on ask if i nee anything in the room etc atleast 4 bell in a day when i be around which be a pain cocktail party of the wedding guest one night make it to beyond midnight and be difficult to sleep becuase of the song and loud music staff be very courteous close both to the airport and the city about 40 minute travel each way enjoy the spa service and be worth the money i m a Taj Inner Circle member and we have a great time at the Taj Exotica and the Taj Gateway in 2016 i m never consider the Taj again because of our terrible experience at Taj Yeswantpur for their disgusting New Year Party name Los Angeles 2017 im write my first tripadvisor review today because ive never feel so cheat like this and that too by a hitherto trust brand like the Taj purely because of the Taj brandname i book the Taj yeswantpur New Year Party the room package for 11 999 very early on Dec 5th itself usually we book our yearly New Year plan a week in advance of New Years eve so that we can evaluate the various different hotel option this year we sacrifice that because on Dec 5th the Taj folk promise me something that be important to me my wife and i be celebrate a special day and i have specifically request for a pool face room on the high floor i be assure that this would be do and after they make that promise i buy the non refundable ticket i reconfirm again with them a week before New Year and i be tell that a 11th floor pool face room be arrange for us before the event on 30th i call again but the number be always engage some lady occasionally take the call and upon mention our request she keep say shell check and call back and never do i call the Taj Yeswantpur number and then they forward our call to another line that be always engage i repeatedly call them and explain our situation and they start tell me that they have no involvement with this and an event management company be run this event Mind you in the first week of December when i call the Taj Yeswantpur number and ask specifically for the Taj Yeswantpur New Year party they never make any mention of any event management company it be implicitly understand that it be a Taj Yeswantpur event on New Years eve on the day that we check in i be tell that no room can be allocate for such event day and that we will have to make do with whatever room they provide i try call the guy who promise me during book guy name Kishore and he do not take our call after repeat attempt we finally get some random room on 3rd floor the Taj guy feign ignorance again slyly distance themselves from all this mes by proclaim that they have no involvement with this and an event management company be run this event this too even though it be hold right in their compound and also have multiple poster all around the place with the Taj Yeswantpur name prominently appear on these poster we reluctantly go to our room and reconcile ourselves with the situation even though our special day plan be ruin but we console ourselves that at least the New Year party would cheer us up sadly the bad be only yet to come we be terribly shock that a brand like the Taj could do such a bad job of run a party it be a disaster on multiple front the event resemble a temple distribute free prasad to the needy unfortunately even temple event manage crowd far more efficiently than Taj Yeswantpur Everything that can go wrong do it be a total mes highlight few of the many miss that night below Food and Drinks within the Taj compound between the main building and the hall theres a section with a huge tree the New Year event be hold there the entry to this section be through a single glas door of the main building at 730 PM there be a crowd of reveller by this door wait to get in once inside what hit you hard be the feeling that you just get lock up in some stranger badly organise noisy and heavily crowded marriage clearly there be far too many people than the facility could service this be especially true in the mens washroom there be just one small bathroom for man and it be far too crowded and stuffy Multiple queue form up in the loo and there be also folk who clearly could not manage their drink luckily we find three ladies restroom Outside the people sit in horde on the stair unable to find space to settle the crowd be a mix of different type of people Most of the crowd be like us feeling absolutely cheated out of their hard earn money but what be also quite unsettling be that there be oth kind of folk too the kind you would not associate with a brand like the Taj we pay top dollar to avoid such crowd during such occasion but there quite a lot of them there this be especially pronounce at the drink section the drink section be a total let down too there be just 2 3 elevated spot where you could get drink the tree area have one and each of the two hall have one each this arrangement be grossly inadequate to service the enormous crowd Massive crowd pile up in front of these counter you literally have to fight for get a drink and we easily spend about 15 minute just to get one drink the same drink taste very different each time the barman have no clue make drink and every drink be simply a convenient mix of the available alcohol ice cube and juice Specific request like Cosmopolitan or Bloody Mary or Martini be not entertain finally i go for generic request like any cocktail will then do please and they mix it all in a glas and give it to me Mind you there no consistency in taste two glass of the same thing differ vastly in the content of alcohol and the ingredient one time my wife and i order the same drink and in one drink when the barman run out of vodka he just pour in rum just to complete the order the barman be not at all professional and one time i wait for almost 20 min for a cocktail and once it be my turn i see the barman wipe the sweat off his brow and then without clean his hand he pat his unclean hand on wad of mint that he put it into the drink i just walk away disgusted and get into the next queue for another 10mins to get bottled beer alas the beer be warm and not at all chilled the food be not warm and due to the December chill and it be cold and taste horrible Food keep run out and it be never refill plate and glass pile on the many table that be never clear away in time the dessert section be not replenish there be a drunk guy lie unconscious on the floor at the dessert section nobody bother to take him away and it be a weird feeling take your dessert around a guy lie on the floor right next to him some guy puke all over after that we didnt go to the dessert section the food be terrible cold and tasteless the buffet breakfast next day be in similar state of disarray the so call function fashion show belly dance be badly organize this take place in one of the hall and the compere and performer be fence away from the crowd within the hall these event be hold at ground level and thus be visible only to the people that crowd up at the very front and it be not at all visible to the people behind since most of these folk be drunk we just stay back and do not want to get into any unnecessary tussle we soon leave the hall eventually we spend our time sit on the stair do literally nothing after midnight they do n t even have the countdown in the dance hall where we be at then we go back to our room and just watch tv it be our bad New Year party and definitely not the way we want to spend our special day we hope that the next day breakfast would be well and it turn out to be even bad it be hold outside at the same venue under the tree and again there be food plate which be never refill food that be terribly cold food that get over soon and again terribly organised i make our booking purely because it have the Taj brand name associate with it and it be clearly mention in the ad that its a Taj event i have the bad experience ever i have already make up my mind never to consider the Taj ever again im pretty sure all the folk whove put their hard earn money into this New Year tomfoolery that Taj yeswantpur pull on us will not consider this place again ive already have make up my mind about Taj now and for our annual Goa holiday we have completely change our mind about Taj Exotica and we be now go ahead with the Leela this year i already know how this message will be receive some guy with a fancy title claim to be some authority at Taj Y will reply to this message say that they be unaware of it that it be not their fault that strict action will be take and that we will be able to visibly experience the change on our next visit or that it be a one off event and such lip service Its simply a ploy to this sites reader to show that they care this be far from the truth they didnt care they clearly didnt seem to care when we bring it up to their attention multiple time the Taj folk wipe their hand off say that an event management team be do the New Year and they have nothing to do with it but they be slyly present at every stage of the event and even when they know it be not go right they just stand there never step in to resolve anything the irony be that as we speak Tajs hold company the Tata Sons be undergo an unfortunate corporate battle at the very top level Its a costly battle thats focusse on intangible like brand legacy and value Its ironic that at the ground level of this Tata Sons battle there be unscrupulous rotten apple like Taj Yeswantpur that prostitute that great brand and pis on that awesome legacy just for a nights worth of money Tata Sons should just close this outlet if theyre really serious of damage to their brand New Year Party at the Taj never again will fall for this terrible idea i keep visit this hotel one in a month or two month room be quite spacious and accommodative Food wise also it good very cordial staff with a happy to serve attitude this i write especially for Mr Hanumantha from Food and beverage department who be so understanding and courteous towards his guest despite of miss breakfast at the coffee shop he have the same send in the room which be a great gesture kudo to entire front office team as well Smiling face all around actually make the guest around happy Thank you very much and keep up the good work Love this hotel we be here for a conference so could not use the hotel facility as much as i want since the hotel have an event and people be check out the lobby and oth area be crowd the room be spacious we be 3 of us stay in the room so we have to tell the housekeeping to get sufficient bath linen and they promptly deliver the breakfast at the caf be excellent though service be slow Staff be friendly and helpful overall good location spacious room and good service i stay at the Vivanta by Taj for 5 day in Dec 2016 and enjoy the experience thoroughly the quick and courteous check in by Nikhil and team set my expectation and i m happy to say everyone live up to it right through my stay i enjoy the breakfast buffet spread and it give a great start to my day on come back tired from work i order both continental and oriental fare from in room dining spaghetti arabiatta spring roll and hakka noodle all serve pipe hot and with the right accompaniment my room on the topmost floor be conveniently locate and be very well maintain as a lady traveller i be pleasantly surprised when i find a box with a nail file nail enamel etc place in the bathroom with a warm note very thoughtful indeed as a frequent traveller i ve learn that it be the small thing that make a big difference and whether it be service or attitude the staff do everything to make one feel care for and special this be especially praiseworthy when i could see that they have over 200 people from a Pharma company on an annual company event the staff be stretch but serve with a smile i m look forward to my next visit i be write this specifically for breakfast buffet and i have to say it be exceptional there be a wide variety af Indian and American unhealthy option the service and hospitality and the breakfast counter be exceptional as well what a fantastic hotel front the moment i arrive to the moment i leave be make to feel extremely welcome by the front desk staff the good part be the warm greeting by Namaskar when you approach them and remind of our tradition the hotel interior be elegant and will take you to old world charm this hotel be of historical significance their be a Gandhi Mandap where Mahatma Gandhi use to addres evening prayer when he be in Bangalore can not thank concierge enough for help me with luggage and all the city information i require in detail Excellent Hotel locate in hub of the city and prop train staff Front desk people be very active regard any issue always get the prompt response from everyone people be very much professional one of the good hotel in city situate in heart of the city as well Special mention for front office staff everyone make effort towards help us Hotel service and facility be also above expectation a perfect dinner with a very humble generous and brilliant staff member namely Mr Abhishek P have a lovely conversation with him and he be good enough to take care of our dinner in an executional manner Food and ambiance be good Absolute disaster Dirty Noisy rude staff culminate in a room service meal that leave my wife with vomiting and diarrhoea for the next 36 hour this be the last night of our fantastic trip around South India we eat everything and everywhere no ill effect jus like on our many previous trip around India until the suppose 5 star hotel which go to be our last night treat the staff at the time be hopeless the email we later receive in response to our complaint be condescending and perfunctory Read the oth traveller review apparently we be not alone have come here with family to celebrate a Birthday we simply love the ambience the buffet spread and the service Sunil be extremely attentive to our need the mocktail be simply too good Great place to spend the Sunday Would love to get back here again comfortable stay at lalit front desk people help a lot during entire stay also all the staff be very much friendly and give lot of information about the city tour as we go to

with loud music pulsate like its in my own room People shout outside in the passage and even after complain for over two hour i be tell that the music will shut at 2 pm and its a separate entity over which the hot l have no control Incredible to be say sorry to 10 time and no rectification at all i recently stay in the hotel and it be my first visit to Bengaluru the hotel staff be really amazing specially Harsh who be at front office that time be a really amazing person with a very friendly attitude Help me to explore the city by arrange tour for me a traditional old style luxury hotel with marble stair hardwood floor and meticulously landscape ground Music be very loud in Sutra apart from that i d like to thank the 24 7 staff Madan Manjeeth Charan Abhishek Senthahe for their assistance with buffet dinner i stay for a day here the hotel be nice and have good ambience the restaurant have many option the staff at restaurant be awesome they give me several option for me to eat as i have jain food Special thank to the chef who take extra care and make a advance note that i be serve what i need in jain food the only thing i do not like be slow response from front desk that can be ignore overall worth stay and relaxing this be a traditional old style luxury hotel with marble stair hardwood floor and meticulously landscape ground room be functional and there be a breakfast buffet that be similar to what you would find in oth hotel of the same price range unfortunately what make this hotel unique for me be the unbelievable amount of noise there be thump dance club type music so loud that my room be vibrate play until 20 minute after midnight perhaps want to go to sleep before that time be a ridiculous notion but desire or not sleep be impossible the second type of noise be a long and extremely loud conversation take place among a group of people who seem to be stand right outside my door there be no soundproofing property in the door at all although compare to the oth disturbance it seem quite mild the sound of water run through the pipe when a neighbor use water be also audible if you want to party and or have some very effective ear plug this may be a great place to stay however i can not recommend this property to anyone travel on busines as a quiet place to sleep and work be a basic requirement for busines people on the go my very short stay at the hotel be nice but the kind staff Mr Abhishek at the restaurant make my day he notice i have food allergy so offer to pack something for my day very important to have this eye for detail i be initially skeptical while book the hotel however i must say i be wrong i arrive at around 10 be and front desk be helpful to allow me early check in without any hesitation and additional charge check in be quick and efficient Quality of room be also upto expectation to an extent but it be cover up by the great staff i have only breakfast and it be elaborate and good Shall be back again whenever i come back to Bangalore my wife and i enjoy our weeklong stay at the Lalit Bangalore we be fan of the Lalit brand and have stay at 3 of their oth property the Lalit Bangalore be locate in a lovely quiet part of central Bangalore the room be excellent and the balcony have a great view from 7th floor just call room service to unlock the pool be also wonderful practically speak Ubers have no issue find the hotel and get around the city from the hotel be n t too bad oth than the typical Bangalore traffic the metro be a 10 minute cab away if need the hotel have a lounge downstairs and club upstairs while we do n t use either we look around the roof club and it look awesome it seem pretty popular when we arrive on Sunday night my one disappointment be the service quality be lack we often

for 15 min on the stage just to wave at people Music play be also very bad at one point i think dj may have forget his collection and may be play song from a cassette use tape recorder Count down for 2019 song be 2003 song its the time to disco and the bad part the drink counter be only two with 5 foot up above the ground People have to literally climb the rail and beg the bartender for a drink and they be behave as they be give free drink to refugee it take us 30 min to just get a drink in our hand the place be so over book and over crowd people hardly could move they have tell there would be a cracker show and gues what it be 4 flower pot which be light up when the clock turn 12 the buffet spread be very elaborate but the taste be very average the rest room be all outside temporary cabin type which be a big let down too and our misery do not end there we have to wait for 2 hour to get our car from vallet they have park all the car at some random place without manage a thing it be such a choa while leave after wait for 2 hour we walk down search for our car catch hold of the vallet driver get the key from him and get it by ourselves my advice please refrain yourself go to any event organize by the Lalit we do not expect such a pathetic hosting of a party by a 5 star brand hotel the standard be not even close to give 1 star after this experience not for just event i doubt go there for anything i stay during a busines trip i get room on 5th floor the DJ club be right above my room on 6th floor and loud noise start come from 9 or 10 in the night and continue till 0100 hr when i decide to shift my room the room allot be on 2nd floor and it be very comfortable stay afterwards the good part of the hotel be that it be at a convenient distance from airport and yet not too far from it or the city the location be excellent and mostly peaceful although there be a railway line nearby and train sound come occasionally but inside the room the train sound be hardly noticeable the buffet breakfast be excellent the room service be excellent and the bathroom have adequate amenity the checkout though be not smooth due to lack of adequate manpower deploy the good GYM i have ever be to late machine i meet a guy call rajesh there he be very helpful during my stay at the hotel he teach me some stretch which be outstanding Thank you for the lovely stay 5 star luxury

just excellent the service provide be too good and the food be equally good we be serve with prop value and care the evening spend in lalit be a pleasant evening the lady in charge Ms Kajal Mardana be very humble and she greet us warmly Nice place to visit i have a rather disappointing experience at this hotel there be a wedding go on when i check in and the party continue late into the night the music be so loud that the furniture in the hotel room vibrate obviously impossible to sleep they turn down the volume a little bit after midnight but the damage be already do the room be OK the bed comfortable and the breakfast quite good although they charge extra for mineral water but the loud music spoil my experience completely not what you want after a long and exhausting day on the road the hotel be a landmark room be nice and comfortable Bath be equally good Good family size room some what disappoint room smell bad upon entry room freshener be at rescue could have be well overall 5 of 5 minus 1 dor smell i be at this hotel for a very short stay one thing i should mention and appreciate be that i be to check out at 5 in the morn and check in at 10 in the night Receptionist ask if he may pack some breakfast while checkout i think that speak volume about this hotel the stay in this hotel be not upto the standard that be expect from a hotel of this type there be a lot of disturbance for the date that me and my colleague be stay from the 28th November 2018 till 1st December 2018 in the night with a lot of loud music which be disturb for the guest stay in the hotel a lot of people have complain but to no avail the hotel be well locate right opposite a golf course the room be large enough and the bed comfortable the restaurant have a wonderful buffet of both Indian and international cuisine and the waiter be attentive it be in a close proximity to a wonderful little shopping centre call Raintree unfortunately on our last night there be a party in the hotel and the noise level be unacceptable this be a tale of two hotel in one but that main take away be that if you re plan to sleep here on a Friday or Saturday night stay someplace else i be book into this hotel as part of a scientific conference hold in another hotel the first night be OK the second night Thursday there be some loud music come from one of the two night club on premise then on Friday the hotel be set up for wed one the ground by the pool my room be on the 5th floor face the pool Friday night the music be so loud i could n t talk on my phone in my room the bas be rattle item in my room and my cell phone app put the sound level at over 80db average with peak over 90db i be try to work and it be impossible and i also own a live music venue and a nightclub about midnight i go to the front desk to complain to manager and i could tell i be about 12 to beat him up about this i tell him it be unconscionable to book a conference group of scientist then subject them to this level of noise Friday night be a wedding On Sat night there be a sweet 16 party and we leave to have dinner until 11 pm when we get back to the hotel there be people at the front desk yell at the staff and ask why the police they d call have be turn away by hotel security we decide to just go to one of the nightclub and have a few drink since sleeping be n t an option i be surprised both club be go charge us a cover even though we be stay in their hotel and only go because it be already so loud the hotel overall be n t too bad though it show it age at about 50 yr some item could use updating but it seem clean the staff be good when they re not try to apologize or rationalize the loud environment the wifi be n t very fast and the power go out regularly and it take a while to get the router back up i m guess it old too the hairdryer do n t really make any heat i have two extra day after the conference and check out as soon as i could and bolt for the ITC Gardenia Hotel it great i will never stay at this Lalit Ashok again and would advise other who be not there for the partying to consider oth option we have the buffet lunch at the Coffee Shop yesterday and be so delighted all four of us remark that we feel light not overstuffed inspite of eat really well the menu be different everything be tasty very different from hotel in same star category thank Lalit Ashok the location be central and the staff be very courteous although housekeeping be abysmal the bed have not be make fresh and they have to be remind late at night to give fresh sheet and cover the room be date and require renovation the upholstery look fade and stain the design of the bathroom be quite inconvenient with the toilet seat very oddly place the breakfast be fine and quite substantial Excellent gym instructor and good guidance especially fitnes trainer Mr Smaran it be nice work out with him i be here only for a week but the training i get be for my lifetime i really feel the difference between now and then Warm hospitality with beautiful lady Ms Samjhana and Ms Shreya from houskeepe department take care the room nicely they be very friendly and helpful i would definetly visit next time and recommend to my friend and colleague a good venue for a conference with nice meeting room and attentive staff Food service very reasonable but not outstanding the thing that grate be be charge 1000 INR a day to use the WiFi even as a pay conference delegate if a venue truly want to be a conference venue such thing be part of the package not extra the hotel be well locate and the surround ground be lovely and tranquil but the room although comfortable enough be quite basic and old fashioned floor nee carpet lighting be harsh and need a rethink furniture be old and bathroom nee an upgrade towel could also be renew they be thin and grey when mean to be white it very nice to be able to sit outside for meal in the cool air of Bangalore and this be a big plus point of the hotel the dinner service however in 24 7 although pleasant be very slow finally i be disappointed that i have to chase up twice to get my invoice email to me on check out i be promise it within 1 2 hour when it have not arrive the next day i have to call twice before it be resolve Thank you Sudharshan very very good service by gajendra Kumar Restaurant area be very good Table setup be also good food be so tasty CHICKEN Tika Mr GAJENDRA and sunil be very helpful hotel location be very good thank for 24 7 Excellent hotel Great location First visit to Bangalore stay here for a conference particularly love the breakfast area and swimming pool Staff very attentive in particular Manjesh Would definitely recommend if youre consider a visit the Hotel be beautiful Staff be wonderful and responsive Breakfast be superb however if it not possible to sleep in the hotel until after 1 30 AM the Hotel have very loud music that go on until very late i be on the 5th floor and my room vibrate with the music the first night i be tell the music would end by midnight but it go on much longer on the second night well after midnight and after two complaint to guest service i be give another room in which to sleep it be n t convenient to change room so late in the night but at least the music be not as loud the hotel need to decide what be more important provide guest with a quiet place to sleep or catering to very loud party with a noise level that make it impossible for guest to sleep at a reasonable hour Lalit Ashok feel peaceful and luxurious from the moment you enter the gate the staff be very gracious and helpful in all department housekeeping front desk restaurant pool staff the room be well light and the restaurant be a delicacy Kitty Ko be also worth a visit for the lively crowd and vibrant music i do mis a kid activity area especially for family and hope to see some improvement there until the next time i stay here for a week on busines and have a wonderful time the fitnes center be well check

awful experience the Lalit Ashok be one of the old 5 star hotel in Bangalore it still most popular place for busines meeting and conference but in my personal opinion the quality of service at the Lalit Ashok be not upto 5 star standard Room service be very slow and so be the resturant service the wait staff at resturant be too occupy even when resturant be more than 70 empty and be not even bother to service the table or provide with cutlery when food have arrive on table my stay in lalit asoka be like good of good everything be so perfact and well manage i realy enjoy every moment

into night even check out have issue and they totally forget to offer take away breakfast even though they take note of it not to forget a wrong Mini Bar consumption bill which we find out after reach airport and just have to ignore it as part of their general behavior there be much well property than this in the locality some first become last one Hotel be very good Ambience be unbeliveable like

Lounge of a low cost hotel Will not plan any stay in future ITC Windsor be well option just 200 mt opposite to Lalit i will not recommend this property to any one first and foremost i d like to praise the Lalit Ashok for be LGBT friendly hotel s the one of you who be familiar with Bangalore or India for this matter know that this be not something which should be take for grant that be say as mention in the title i wo n t be return to Lalit for a second round my busines travel start on July 30 when i check in the hotel and end yesterday August 5 i never leave a hotel as frustrated as i do yesterday during my travel i have be stay in hotel which be significantly less equipped and prestigious than the Lalit Ashok where the service level didnt even aim to match the one offer in the Lalit the point here be that although this be the most frustrated i ever be this be not even close to be the overall bad experience i have in hotel before i get to the negative part of my staying id like to mention Hema and Mutha from the reception despite the bad experience i have from the different service of the hotel these two be definite exception enjoy every moment with them Outstanding service so what go wrong 1 on my third day i notice the one and only perfume i have in my room have disappear when report this incident in the front desk i be tell that it will be check and ill be contact i wont get into all the detail and timeline because i dont want to provide any inaccurate info so allow me to summarize with this the hotel didnt update it at any point leave me with inconvenience and embarrassment of reach the front desk more than five time ask for update from the different receptionist instead of have a supervisor to handle this and keep me informed when i mention it to the hotel staff i be tell that they have try to reach me over the rooms phone to put thing into perspective after leave Bangalore i proceed to Goa Yesterday upon my arrival in one of goas hotel i ask for detail about any nearby gym with full equipment this morning when i wake up i notice a letter next to my doorstep slip underneath which include all the detail i ask for the night before just one of many idea how they could ve keep me informed the Lalit Ashok staff mention to me that the entrance to my room be check and so do the house keep staff and that theyre sure that the staff have nothing to do with it Dont get me wrong i totally appreciate that the Lalit Ashok stand behind their staff however they could have tell me that in the beginning and not have me go through the entire exhausting proces during which i be ask to provide proof of purchase invoice of the perfume i do provide the invoice as the perfumed be buy in the Duty Free but if the above be their stand from the first place why do they ask me for the invoice to check my credibility to sum it up the day before i leave we agree that we hotels staff and i dont know how the perfume have disappear maybe it be throw away to the trash by mistake or maybe i leave the door open Thats not the point the point be that i leave the hotel with a bitt feeling even humiliate i stay in the Lalit Ashok for six night in a rate of more than 130 dollar a night spend my money in all of their facility Spa Room Service Bar and Restaurant and my entire experience be ruin because of a 90 dollar perfume Full disclosure i be give the option to reduce the daily room charge discount however this be already pay in advance by my company and do n t make any different to me as a personal client in addition i be give the option for two free dinner in the hotel s restaurant even if i be interested this be n t an option due to early commitment after reject these two offer nobody have bother to followup with me 2 another two incident wait for more than an hour for a dish at the restaurant eventually force me to have a snack in my room skip dinner and procee to another commitment wait for an iron for more than 45 minute it take three call and 45 minute until nice guy form the staff be send to my room to pick up my shirt iron them downstairs and bre them back up at this point i be already late for my meeting and miss breakfast this entire fiasco could have be avoid if they have just send someone the moment they understand they dont have any available iron the perfumed and iron incident cause me to rank the Lalit Ashok Poor rather than Excellent incident happen as someone who work in a hotel i can totally understand it but these incident be handle to badly both while handle it and afterwards Staff be nice beautiful location near golf course and large property Room be old hotel be old need to be renovate it can not sustain with lalit name there be many option in Bangalore well price and well location i ve be stay at lalit in

Abhishek and Pinaki excellent chef and cater to your individual need even if the dish be not in the buffet they will ensure to arrange Ashish Madan Sabya restaurant exec and Vikash Banquet Manager for

though be in Bangalore for a busines meeting and think of stay at the Lalit Ashok it be a very good experience check in be quick room be good and spacious temperature in room be very good buffet breakfast spread be fabulous gym be modern and well equipped overall a fantastic experience Hotel be very clean Staff be courteous and helpful breakfast setup be really Amazing Hotel will arrange a taxi for you spend most of the day relax by the pool the management team be commendable highly recommend this place this be very nice hotel look like it be build some year back but much young Fresh room with enough space large and space bathroom with both showere and bath tub all clean and nice Extra plus for the pool area spa and many choice of restuarent we stay with my in law and child and Infant from 2 5 July we be extremely disappointed with the facility and service provide for the price we pay Aircon temperature control knob doesnt work either on or off only toilet flush doesnt work all three day and we nee to call technician everyday to fix it on the last day water from toilet tank waste for 1 hour even after continuous complaint for 1 hour no one bother to fix it all over night we hear pigeon murmur sound near varandah room floor be damage i will post all picture here and people decide yourself to stay last day we notice inside quilt cover be dirty and never clean i will never stay in this property anymore i will not recommend my friend to stay in this property last day before i checkout i want to meet the hotel manager but front desk tell me he be busy anyway Thank you Lalit for your disastrous hospitality to our family please avoid floor 7 if people still want to stay there i would like to give few positive about this hotel be the location free WiFi and breakfast i have stay at this hotel on my busines trip to bangalore for couple of day i really like the location of the hotel which be very quite you dont hear HONKs from the street which be usually hear from the indian road the pool gym and the spa be excellent to chill out even it have get the wide choice of restaurant and lounge like kitiko sutra and balauchi the breakfast serve be okay and even the room look outdated which you would never expect from a lalit chain of hotel otherwise overall experience be quite pleasing and its a very good value for money book this hotel for one night for a busines trip the hotel reception service be pathetic Inspite of ask them a non smoking room they fool us and intentionally tag our luggage and give us a smoking room when inform them about the same they make us wait for an hour and be totally non apologetic about it They waiste 1 30 hr for just give the room that we book so not recommend at all since i enter into the hotel i be take care every well likely a VIP what else one need especially the Duty Manager Mr Suryansh who be really nice in all the aspect very happy from front desk as they have an eye detail about our birthday Thank you for lovely surprise Excellent experience Will come again Many thank to Front Team n Suryansh because of its awesome location and a good branding attach i choose Lalit Ashok Bengaluru for a stay of a couple of night with high expectation but it fail to meet up to my expectation in many front the room though spacious and well appoint but have poor toilet amenity the shower cubicle have only an overhead fix shower no tap or flexible shower and one ca n t think of wash foot without be completely wet Toilet hygiene concept have change globally health faucet be provide even in the West and Europe the Japanese have move many step further but the Lalit Bengaluru in India have not change the hotel even do n t supply a shower cap however i must appreciate that the hotel have well maintain sprawl garden and long walking strip the main restaurant have a big veranda which offer the luxury of sip the tea outside in the pleasant Bengaluru climate we have buffet breakfast lunch and dinner and the food layout variety be exceptional the main course have many non vegetarian choise which include fish prawn chicken mutton pork beef almost everything the pool and the gym be also nicely maintain Room service be pathetic we check in late in the night around 1 be and be shock to see that the room service menu do n t have round the clock option on query they could not offer anything staple but only sandwich and burger the only soup they could offer in non veg be a chicken soup which be nothing but a home style chicken curry with meshed chicken we also order for lassi which turn out to be sweeten curd water serve in small water glass and price astonishingly at r 500 plus taxis an apple which be suppose to be serve with the compliment and delight of the hotel be nothing compare to the price one pay for the five star luxury but fail to reach our room even after a reminder request i be very unimpressed with this hotel that be supposedly state to be a 5 Star Hotel when i get to my room it smell of smoke and you could clearly tell the cleaner try to mask the smell of smoke with some type of air freshener thankfully the smell disappear after a day i stay at this hotel for 6 night and almost every NIGHT there be very LOUD music come from the nightclub on the top floor absolutely unbelievable that this hotel be run a nightclub where the music be blast through the hall and disrupt everyone s ability to sleep how do you run a 5 Star Hotel with a dingy nightclub i be here for busines and a conference and see many international guest stay at the club you would think that the hotel would take that into consideration and not have the nightclub run for a few day but no if the hotel be try to make more money then host a nightclub be not the way to go there be some positive the staff be nice apart from the club manager who claim he be go to lower the music after me and some colleague complain many time about the noise the morning breakfast be also amazing with lot of variety regardless of the few positive i will never stay here again i suggest look elsewhere when i arrive the room i be put in have many issue 1 there be nest pigeon on the balcony which mean i be unable to sleep in the morning with incessant hooting you could n t shoo them away as they be protect the nest 2 there be an overwhelming smell of mould and feeling of moisture in the room 3 there be mould in the bathroom embed in the tile in the shower 4 the pillow and bedding smell of mould it be completely unacceptable after complain and see the housekeeping manager i be move to a club room which be much nice and i can report whilst still a bit mouldy in the bathroom it be something i could deal with unfortunately the hotel be mainly a function venue and night club and this mean that on almost every night there be noise that make sleep impossible the source of the noise be numerous 1 the bar music easily audible 6 floor above 2 a wedding with a massive sound system in the pool area 3 a nightclub on the 6th floor which despite apparently only operate friday saturday and sunday operate oth night eg Thursday 4 floor below this nightclub lyric be clearly audible and sleep be impossible until 3 am the staff be largely fairly pleasant the breakfast be O K but this a hotel to avoid this hotel probably back in the 80 be a five star residence but the passing of time and lack of maintenace make this property outdate in the India of 2018 Property need to be deeply refurbish room be old tired and not look good at all cleanes be not what you expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel hair find in the sink upon enter in the room same on the shower floor slipper feel old and use not seal in the plastic bag Cabinet have just 3 hanger all different from each oth bed sheet and pillow be not spotless no modern socket for rechare all stuff you have nowday however Internet be fine i have never be a Lalit s fan but this experience will not help to increase my consideration of this Hotel chain while the property be largely OK and the room be OK as well the incessant obnoxious music that play at the lounge and nightclub every night make this place absolutely terrible when i check in on a Saturday evening i could n t even hear the person at the counter because the music at the lounge be so loud the next night the party move to the roof top nightclub and be so loud that thing in my room be vibrate and i be 4 floor below the club and the club go until 3 AM so do n t expect to get a good night sleep anywhere in the hotel it absolutely insane i go to a hotel to sleep which be near impossible here the only recourse be to move room which be a lose battle because there really be n t a quiet room in the hotel not to be all negative the breakfast be quite good though you ll be tired when you go because you ca n t sleep anywhere the room be OK but be very very dated and in desperate need of updating my room be clean another colleague of mine be place in a room cover with mold this be not a luxury hotel even though the Lalit group call it one Go stay somewhere else in Bangalore there be certainly oth choice at this price point where you can you know sleep in your room what start as a warm welcome at reception turn out to be a terrible hotel stay i do n t usually write many review for hotel but i think i d warn oth fellow busines traveller the following issue be note during my visit i stay on the weekend a room on level 3 and could hear the music from the top floor night club level 6 until 2 am even with ear plug in i could still hear the low frequency vibration from the speaker which result in a bad Sunday night sleep breakfast be suppose to open at 7 am but at 7 25am they be still take food and oth item out to the display and it take nearly 10mins to grab someone to get a hot drink usually at the oth hotel i have stay in the opening time mean all service be available this issue be note on both morning of my stay the gym steam room area look like it have not be clean in a while so i decide to not use the facility as it do not feel relax see all the use towel strew all over the floor my bathroom tile about 2 foot below ceiling level be mouldy on check out it take forever to get the bill as the printer be break also i select the charge to be in Indian rupee i tick the receipt for INR however my card be charge in EUR which be very odd as i be from the UK and the local currency be GBP so now i have to deal two round of terrible exchange rate so as to leave a balanced review we have dinner on the first evening in the Asian restaurant on the same floor as the night club the music be too loud though it be n t so busy as we be only one of two table so the chef be very welcoming and make some really nice food for us Dialled the Rejuve Spa today 26 06 at around 14 30 to book an appointment for a massage only to be hear a hysterical laughter by a lady who then start speak to her colleague in the local language Kannada say there someone on the phone who be speak in English i can understand and speak Kannada and would have be more than happy to communicate in Kannada it surprising that the staff answer the phone could n t speak English and absolutely appalling that they burst out laugh for reason unknown this may be a one off incident but nonetheless it should n t have happen i hope this review be use constructively to educate the staff in question on customer service stay for a night check in quite late very nice toiletry in the bathroom Excellent breakfast with good selection of food room be decent check in be prompt well keep property Central location a very old hotel in need of total refurbishment Poor service for the breakfast buffet Would not stay at this hotel again or recommend this hotel the noise from the pub on Sunday night be irritating Check in be pleasant but thats where the good part of this hotel stop the room be very very date the bed saggy and the furnishing wear my room safe didnt work which be soon fix but should have be part of their room check before allocate to a guest but my big complain the noise from the bar club which go on until 1 am on a Sunday Monday night morning so when you have to be up for work at 6 be this be not acceptable at no point during our check in be there a mention of the noise frustratingly when we walk round the roof top bar at 9 be it be practically empty when reception be call they simply hang up never ever visit this hotel unless you dont want to sleep and be happy pay 5 star price and get a 2 star room Shocking Hotel be clean comfortable and quiet Staff be friendly and helpful without be obtrusive Wifi sufficient Good food for breakfast and amenity be all there be upgrade to suite when standard room be unavailable Great hotel and location for a busines trip Staff Excellent Polite and very considerate they go out of their way to be helpful in a non obtrusive manner Puja at the front desk need a special mention Food above average the breakfast be good and so be buffet and ala carte meal each item retain its taste its variety with quality Location there couldnt be a well location for a hotel in Bangalore its the old public sector ITDC hotel and so be set up right opposite the golf course and VIP residence Gentry still retain its old world charm and so you can bump into Peter Blanc the father of living wall Rahul Dravid and Venkatesh Prasad interior the big drawback be the interior the room be tiny what go as an executive room here be actually the low size in maybe Marriott but the bad be the varied shade of a horrible pinkish brown granite its on the floor on the wall in the toilet in the restaurant i be tell the new owner be try to change it i hope they succee but from what i see they be instal Italian marble it will just make it into another hotel to give it character they could have go in for Chettinad tile which be make not far off the furniture be the classical type from the late sixty it should be preserve and not throw out in the pursuit of modernity this furniture with good print tile would give this hotel an amazing ambience Exteriors Building be late sixty and have clear cut line look good the hotel have some beautiful foliage they could easily bre this hotel on par with West End in term of the garden they shouldnt lose this opportunity View from the window should be consider all pool face room also see the roof of the gymn its bare with an AC unit in one corner Could be convert to a green roof to sum up this hotel have everything go for it just need some imagination to create an ambience which could make it into a great hotel Maynot stay here again because of the room the pink marble and low light can be depressing i be on a busines trip and stay at this property for two night i find the property peaceful and quiet the check in take time or maybe i check in at the most crowded moment the room have all the basic to stay for two night Th morning buffet breakfast be the good part of the stay Huge variety of food option and the staff at the breakfast area be very helpful and courteous one could opt to sit outside face the pool in open air i do opt that see the image and it definitely add to your experience overall a decent stay i would n t call it luxurious though compare with the price of the stay visit with friend seem to be a wonderful place have a great decor and food menu and our server nitish play a vital role in suggest us some amazing dish and seem to be calm compose yet enthusiastic in his behaviour while serve i would definitely recommend this place to everyone Special thank to ni tish and his management for make our visit amazing from outside it look very fancy and attractive as you cros the lobby and enter the room area you get to reality room be not that great and nee a lot of improvement Restaurant though be very good and offer a pool side view they Gym be also fancy it house 2 night club one in the lobby and oth on the terrace both be good Do visit Kitty Ko once Breakfast option be very limited and mid night food option be also very limited they nee to change this as well Room tariff be low but food be very costly overall it be an average experience we book this hotel during our visit to Bangalore city last to last month during check in we feel that we come to a guest house because we have be treat like that no alertnes while your guest be check in we enter in the lobby and i settle my wife and kid in seating area still no attention towards us i move to reception counter where only one staff be take all the check in i be tell to wait for couple of minute which finish in almost after 20 minute this be a shame that in this kind of busy hotel only one person take check in and put oth guest in queue like some commercial ticket counter Room be small but good because it be old ITDC hotel which take over by Lalit Management i find some of there staff still follow the old govt hotel culture they have no courtesy for anyone we eat lunch on arrival in coffee shop which be ok and dinner in there speciality Indian restaurant first evening which be disaster i think they must review there recipe well i will not book this hotel again Good stay restaurant breakfast be awesome and room service be slow need to be pull up Front desk Hema be very helpful and take care of me 24 7 staff be very nice and take special care of me as i be repeat guest we husband wife be there for 3 night it could have be much well Breakfast service be terrible order for egg and toast didnt get suppose to get fruit platter but they say only if we ask for and that also only Apple room be not so good only good thing of the hotel be if you meet the chef Mr Pankaj personally he take good care stay here during my present trip to Banglore location be very good staff be very good room and batharoom with old fitting nee more cleannes flush be not work properly and bed linen also not fr have to be check all this food be good this property be centrally locate with spacious room this be my 3rd visit and i have notice that cleanlines be not there you may like to look at picture i have take Broken tea cattle fungu on head rest of bed and also fungu in shower cabin i have also see candy rapper and use tissue under the bed if you be look for clean place to stay then be be not the place you want to be i happen to be here with my kid for a conference i book an executive king room which i think would be spacious and with a large bed they give me a room on the 6th floor it have a dirty balcony with bird dropping and be extremely unsafe for kid with a low railing and no pool view we shift to the 2nd floor that have a connect room this room be much small with a small size bed the whole night my toddler be disturb with our neighbour voice which be oh so clear room be never clean and bathroom remain extremely dirty not worth a penny P S Food be below average the moment i get into the hotel i realize this be not a Lalit property the room be age old and highly overpriced the bed be so uncomfortable i could barely sleep whole night it feel like a government hotel inside out at the breakfast the menu be obviously limit with half the table take and the oth half not clean yet the restaurant be highly understaffed please do n t be fool by the Lalit name because it definitely not one of their good property hi this be to say we have a beautiful experience with chef Pinaki saraswath and Manjeet who take good care at the coffee shop in bangalore Lalit certain salad be too good for word and exceptionally tastebud tickelle sudarshan thirumalai love everything about this hotel the check in be flawless kudo to the staff the room be beautiful with a well appoint housekeeping team who be so warm and friendly and eag to please Food be really good and a vast breakfast spread it not too far from the shopping and popular area of Bangalore Overall have an amazing stay this huge hotel have a nice location opposite the park but car parking be extremely busy and crowded it seem to cater more for corporate event than individual the room be standard the sixth floor restaurant be difficult to get to on Friday night when the wealthy young thing of Bangalore take over the floor to party if you do manage to get into the restaurant it be extremely dark and sinist as well as be ludicrously expensive the name itself define its glory the Lalit Ashok more popularly know as the Ashoka Hotel in Bengaluru this be most probably the old and the most luxurious hotel in the I T Capital Bengaluru base right next to the CMs guest house the LaLit Ashok be an example of a good luxury hotel the ambience of the hotel be amazingly positive and relaxing the staff be super polite and courteous and make sure that you feel like home they amaze me with their love the moment i reach my beautiful room full of chocolate gues what they make chocolate out of my picture my parent even never do this for me frankly i cant thank them enough for this be a que person youre not welcome like a regular guest but the LaLit Ashok respect all individual irrespective of their caste gender identity or sexuality they simply serve PURE LOVE Kitty Ko their very own nightclub be its attraction the concept be simply mind blow its a must go to place PURE LOVE the hotel location be great the room be quite big the resturant and pool view be good but the food be not that great this you can consider as average the hotel staff be very friendly it have get big hall and banquet to hold any function overall a good hotel but the service be not of 5 star after stay in Lalits in Delhi and Kolkata this particular one would be the most average ring in all aspect room be very old small and dark Lobby be small with very low ceiling Nothing that exude 5star hotel feel at all Curtains in the room do n t work at all not bother as there be no view only face the driveway of the porch no privacy so may as well not open it room be very very old and date a lot of work need to be do on the hardware toilet be narrow flush need to be press hard in order to work the tap and fixture be old and tight Room need a lot of lighting seem very dark and not well light Coffee house be the only nice thing sunny and wide open face the pool and the well manicured ground usually one associate the name of Lalit Hotels with luxury however the stay be not that satisfactory the room look a bit old there be mosquito in the room as well as in the breakfast area the breakfast be good but the seating area be small the table be not clean regularly and we have to call them twice to do that the staff be friendly and helpful but take too much time at check in and checkout somehow the experience do nt match with the rating of the Hotel Food be excellent Hema at the front desk be very helpfull lady i would love to return back to this hotel when ever possible i have a great time at the hotel will return back to the hotel next month have a wonderful stay at the Lalit the staff be courteous as ever and we be well take care of the simple thing like complimentary water and fruit tell you the positive mentality of the management they do charge on the room cost but then they do n t behave poorly when it come to service the property be old but surprisingly well maintain the location be just amazing if you do not want the hustle bustle Housekeeping and Restaurant staff be really up to the job thank for the lovely hospitality i have an OK experience with this Hotel we stay with our family for a weekend the room be not up to the mark in spite of it be a 5 star hotel the staff be good but not professional Different staff keep call us 5 time in the last day in spite of inform them about the late check out early in the morning that be annoying the pool be good but there be no sufficient reclining chair for the many who come there to relax maybe a good choice for a Business trip but not recommend for a family stay waste of money and way too costly the food be not worth the cost the Elevator have the card punching system which never work every time we use it stay at the Lalit Ashok be like drink a vintage wine pair with good food Period i stay here for a busines trip during late January 2018 as a frequent traveler i have have the privilege of stay with the Lalit Suri Hospitality Group earlier as well while i have a general trust in the Brand but this time it be different follow the thumb rule of check the property review on Trip Advisor before booking i be a bit sceptical with a few fellow reviewer highlight the old room and too much noise in the hotel during weekend as the location of the hotel be close to my place of work i go ahead and make the booking trust on the large brand name and i could not be RIGHT despite it be an old property it have a certain charm to it the warmth of the staff them go an extra mile to make you feel comfortable and special broadly overcome stay in a room which may not be equip with the modern gadgetry bell and whistle but have enough what youd expect from a star property they ensure that i get a room in a different wing of the hotel away from the noise Pros 1 Convenient location surround by verdant green 2 Good spa 3 Courteous and well behave staff 4 Comfortable bedding 5 Perfect for a busines traveller whod want to have a late night meal in the hotel and retire to his room for a peaceful sleep Con rather area of improvement 1 Buffet Breakfast Id expect a well buffet spread than what be on offer surely have a marked scope of improvement a special shout out to Raheel i hope i remember the name correctly and oth team member at the front desk for go out of their way to ensure i have a pleasant stay Big Thumbs up P S i fall ill for a day and the hotel arrange for a doctor on call while expensive and the medicine to be deliver to the room they even check on me periodically which be much appreciate stay at this Property for almost a

these event also take over the pool area mean the only to sit be the lobby bar which do not allow alcohol to be serve there the hotel s response be to offer to taxi us to another hotel with a pool after complain to the management my colleague and i be offer alternative guarantee 100 sound proof room which we accept on the promise that this would sort it they be bad we check out and move hotel to get some sleep extremely disappointed at the rate we be pay we be spend one night here before drive to the airport very early the next morning the staff at reception be cold and unfriendly and not at all helpful when we point out that we would not be able to make use of breakfast as we be leave so early the room be clean but the bed be very small in comparison to everywhere else we have be so we have obviously be give the low standard room which overlook the carpark the pool be nice but there be only 5 lounger for the whole hotel the bar be dreadful dark cold and very noisy so we have to opt for have a pre dinner drink in one of the restaurant as outside be a mosquito zone we move to the oth restaurant which serve a wide variety of food and be shock at the price of the buffet so go a la carte Service be very slow and the staff generally unhelpful and unfriendly we be glad to leave and would certainly not recommend this hotel this be one of those hotel that reek if royalty back in

helpful the hotel be nice and quite full of greenery it have plenty of open space and the location be not far from the city reach the airport cost me Rs 650 besides hotel taxi UBER could be call in the portico of the hotel and i could go anywhere in the city or airport the taxi driver be informed and helpful gps help and charge be not excessively high Food be decently good with variety and the Chef be available stay for 3 night on a busines trip First impression the hotel building be in a state of disrepair as a result of age or neglect the room reflect this state too the hotel seem to be a popular wedding venue find the buffet breakfast to be ok guest expect to be greet and escort to a table which do not happen in my case the in room dining menu be ok with delayed service possibly because of a wedding event at the hotel the travel desk could not arrange transport as all the hotel car be hire by an airline crew the staff be helpful and advise that i use local taxi service not a

at the restaurant all the staff right from reception to the restaurant be very helpful Food be good and the starter and dessert be very good rate be reasonable for a 5 star property altogether it highly recommend for your special party in bangalore i stay here for nostalgic purpose room be not great and look dull can do a great bit on furnishing during my stay there be a party happen and could here music read as noise and be very disturbing Response from support staff be poor Have stay here 6 8 time in the last 2yrs the property be 5 5 but the some staff especially in this case Udit be so unprofessional in dealing while do a checkout when my company have make the payment he insist that i make the payment he waste 25mins argue on the fact that he hasnt receive the money moreover he do not show any concern of me miss my flight not have any Trust factor to a loyal guest who have be stay regularly since last 2yrs after me pay i get a call that the payment be receive and it be the mistake at the hotel end and now the double payment have happen last thing which Udit could have do be call and apologize but he make someone else call and that be the time i think i should write this feedback as the Hotel Lalit doesnt care nor trust i be at Lalit for a day on busines visit Hotel be situate in beautiful surrounding of garden tree make nice impression at first site room be old not maintain Chopper tile in bathroom old furniture everything make hotel run down neither modern nor heritage Food be OK Majority staff service be good but i have bad experience when i ask manager in their 24 by 7 restaurant whether ala carte service can be provide his assistant say yes but tho person costly refuse have a nice swimminpool outside sit with natureq if you be after a peaceful retreat this be not the hotel for you it have two night club one locate on the ground floor and the second one on the sixth floor if you like that kind of thing and a selection of restaurant then this hotel will meet your expectation if however you be on a busines trip and nee to have a good night s sleep it may be a problem as the night club music be a factor until quite late the Lalit Ashok Hotel be also a very popular venue for wedding and function and they have excellent hall and a lovely garden to do so if you nee a good sleep this could be a problem as well however the food be really good Vegetarian selection as well as non vegetarian dish be really tasty and there be a wide selection of colourful and delicious salad the dessert be really beautiful to look at and so many to choose from Sunday brunch be a special affair with live chef station from pizza to kebab to barbecue station and many more to choose from in addition to the buffet service the live station be set up next to the pool and it make for a good experience i have the privilege of meet the head chef chef Ashish and chef Abheshek who attend to our culinary need in a very special way they be expert cater for function with vast number of attendee but they be also very attentive towards individual guest 24 7 restaurant staff member Sudhir Pranab Manjeet Charan and Lachana make a lasting impression on us though there be many friendly and helpful staff member Room interior could be update but the lobby restaurant spa complex and the patio be all quite modern the Lalit garden offer a wind path through majestic tree and be really nice for walk even though you will be able to hear traffic noise it be still quite an asset especially for long stay as one be able to take a walk without leave the hotel ground the housekeeping staff really try to please in every way and i would like to mention Saurav Koushik and Promod as they really pull out all the stop and more to ensure a comfortable stay the maintenance staff and IT staff member be really well train and they be able to solve every query we have in a very short time without any inconvenience whatsoever i really like the big tree surround the property there be many place to have a sit down and that be really refreshing as this be not normally the case at hotel i be here for an seminar organise by Nvidia the hoyel be locate in the main road just the entry og k K road there be two seminar hall Kalinga and Siddhartha the buffer food be ok but not much variety for vegetarian for two wheeler entrance there be a separate gate which be locate in the side of the hotel the hall be big enough and the service be good i love this property from the point i enter this a very nicely do reception area with good room and amentitie this place have get 3 restaurant 2 be fine dining and another one be a club Buffet start at r 1600 per person the Spa out here be amazing so be the pool face gym facility and a morning walk garden be lively and peaceful love the stay its a great place to come with family do not have a good dinning experience at 24x7 for dinner as the service be really poor inspite of the fact the restaurant hardly have people it be a weekend though but have a very good experience during my breakfast that be a part of the package at the same place Let me be the 1st to tell you that this place doesnt care about its guest rest the reason anyone rent a hotel room at a so call star hotel be to get a great meal and peaceful sleep my room be on the 4th floor and the club be on the 6th floor until 1 be the entire room be just bump with loud music and base after an entire day of work one would like to get some sleep but at 10 30 pm all it sound like it try to WR sleep inside a night club the room be date and unlike any oth Lalit property Do not get fool by read the review and book this room this be by far the most hon review of this hotel very disappointing to see that the hotel doesnt care for the guest for whom the hotel be make in the first place it be an amazing stay at the lalit the service which we get be the good the lavish Breakfast near pool make my day and the food be also delicious the greenary garden with lot of plant and tree the staff at front be very friendly and helpful specially puja a memorable stay room be spacious and comfortable Hotel have a well equip gym and spa Hotel have a dance floor which be quite active on weekend overall a good place to stay Food be good with a lean towards Indian cuisine Staff nee to be a little more courteous in deal with customer very nice place value for money to

be spacious and comfortable but very old school there be free wifi acces the buffet breakfast spread be great and also serve outside the restaurant by the pool which be a great experience in the wonderful weather the location be a make or break depend on where you have work its good to stay as close as possible to avoid the notorious traffic in the city Everyone i encounter in the hotel in the Front Office the Restaurant Housekeeping Room Service and most of all the banquet be well groomed well train and comfortingly professional even so the overall experience be undermine because the hotel itself be well past its prime it need renovation the washroom the shower the toilet the carpet the bath linen all reek of wear out decadence the air conditioning in the banquet hall be either too cold or too warm it could not be control the water from the shower vary automatically between unbearably hot and uncomfortably cold make the shower a very uncomfortable experience there be no alternative to use a bucket because there be no tap in the shower cubicle only the shower head there be no health faucet in the wc Put together even in spite of stay in the very spacious suite and the positive and courteous competence of the staff the overall experience be very uncomfortable and i be eagerly wait to check out of the hotel Excellent hospitality and excellent staff specially the front desk Manikanta and Hema thank for the cooperation delicious food i love to come back again the Lalit ashok we enjoy a lot Nice green view balcony room all over awesome stay i have be stay here

roll we need a light meal around 6 but no one seem to know if we could have one one say yes the restaurant staff no in the end we do get a pizza and a drink the pizza be around 700 800 which be

each side of the bed for charge phone with multiple plug socket Nothing in the room tell us the time of meal or the facility and where to find them or how to obtain WiFi or what number for reception we have to call concierge for an iron it come promptly this be a very large modern style impersonal hotel Tea and coffee making be fine plenty of water bed large and comfortable with the usual solid synthetic pillow the pool look pleasant and we have a view of garden and pool Time i have to mention Mr Tusar of Housekeeping Team leader have really do a good job of observation of thing and he have

LaLit Ashok be an olden charm of the Bangalore Have stay at this property multiple time now the one thing that always stand out be that while on the outside the property be well maintain the garden be

your query but the warmth and welcome nature you would hope for from hotel staff be miss stay for 2 night it be am old hotel but well maintain the room be clean and comfortable the bathroom be well maintain and have essential toiletry it be locate in the centre of city in a nice area the staff be courteous and helpful the complimentary buffet breakfast be nice and have wide variety the only complaint i have be that you ca n t sleep in the night because of the loud noise of music from the disco in ground floor i be in the third floor and the whole room would vibrate with boom boom bas

with Shangri La be truly amazing i be think of something similar in Lalit Ashok as well but the moment we arrive at the hotel to the moment we leave it be just one hell of experience at every stage 1 it start off with the arrival i arrive at the hotel entrance and the valet parking guy give me a frustated look and ask to hurry up and leave the car instantly now i have a 21 month old baby and my wife sit at the back even they be rush out without explain any reason once we be out of the car one of the darban tell us that we enter the lobby from wrong side there be no sign tell from where to enter but this be not the way to treat your guest 2 then at the reception the receptionist ask me my name 3 4 time before confirm my reservation now seriously in today s world who ask your name multiple time and confirm it again and again even after show my ID card 3 i have already call the hotel a week before to arrange for a baby cot and a cake with rose for my wife s birthday as a surprise when we enter the room when i enquire about the same at the reception they have no idea about it THANK you for ruin my SURPRISE so they tell me they will arrange for the cake at 5 pm Forget the rose when i come back at 7 pm in my room again there be no cake ask the reception again and they look blank finally at midnight they get me a cake but now it be n t of any use 4 the landline in my room do n t work for the whole stay and no one bother to look at it even after inform the TV channel be so grainy it remine me of dish connection back in 90 5 the baby cot finally come at night and gues what we could see small spider come out of it Disgusting we simply return it back instantly 6 the room be smelly of be old and the balcony door be lock i book a Premium Pool view room and get some corner room with no view seem to be an upgraded room seriously c mon guy 7 on ask about deliver outside food receptionist tell me that the food can be deliver at reception and they will send it to room when the food arrive the guard at the hotel vehicle entry gate tell me over the call that he ca n t allow food inside and i have to come and collect it when i tell that i have speak at the reception about it he say to go to reception and talk to duty manager this be the bad RESPONSE a GUEST CAN GET finally after no one from hotel respond i have to myself go to entry gate and take the food delivery 8 and most of the above seem to be because of the Owner visit with some foreign delegate that one of the hotel staff inform me about i could see that all the hotel staff be busy please the owner and his her team and overlook the guest i think it should be the oth way round for the owner to see how the guest ultimately their sole revenue generation source be be treat on daily basi irrespective of the disruption create by the top management it the bad service i could have imagine consider 5 star hotel service all my oth 5 star hotel stay have be simply awesome that the reason of choose 5 star right the only good thing about this hotel i experience be the breakfast we have next day it be a wide spread and the outside seating overlook the garden and pool be lovely to compliment the breakfast i would n t recommend this hotel for any special occasion from the experience i have i be with my friend on last Friday for a lady night party at sutra first of all if bartender be sooo ignorant to give free liquor we be wait for such a long time if you guy want us to pay we be ready but do not treat your customer in this way then when i request for a glas of water i be ask to pay 50r and they hand over just 2 bottle of 200ml bottle which they provide free in all the hotel when i request for bill they dine be the bartender make money i understand the it be crowd i understand your concern of lady get too drunk but if you be not capable of do a free drink night please do nt if you do do it properly thank for that wonderful pathetic service which i ca nt ask more the Lalit Ashok live up to the expectation in term of grandeur and location quite well build and locate right in the heart of the city however few minor thing could really dampen the overall experience we have book a Deluxe King room but none of them be available so we be upgrade to a pool view room it hardly seem an upgrade when we reach the room it be way down the corridor and have pretty basic amenity nonetheless it be clean and have a small balcony overlook the pool which surprisingly be n t cover nor be there any shack for the chair if it rain which be quite often the case for Bangalore you would n t be able to make much use of it it also appear that the hotel be mostly use for event rather than for stay in additionally the housekeeping staff be lousy and take a long time to deliver anything order maybe due to the long corridor the staff at the breakfast buffet be n t any better either and be even a bit rude Hopefully this may be just one off experience and other would n t face any of it i find this hotel very comfortable to stay in Bangalore this hotel have all the comfort and facility what a 5 start hotel normally have Breakfast be really good with lot of variety Overall good quality be very good i recommend this hotel i always prefer this hotel for my stay if i be in Bangalore Excellent ambience it be a very pleasant stay all the staff be extremely helpful Food be fabulous room spacious and well ventilate Room service be good they maintain a complete hygiene of every aspect whether its food or the room Room service be very nice overall its a very beautiful and extremely nice hotel have a very pleasant stay thankyou lalit ashok for the warm welcome stay for 3 night in sept 21 to 23rd and again 2 night from 24 to 26th October Staff confused lot couldn t identify a guest as a loyal customer 5 night in a month despite be book by same group my colleague from usa be fleece by rs500 pwrday while mine room be cheap and well pool face Worst be that within a month the staff have no idea of the record of gst number guest identity seem ineffecient staff and no senior to manage them my colleague stay not more than 4 hour but charge full and no refund for overcharge worst a 100rs cable be virtually chase for its return though they could have change me since we book together and it be a small price for the embarrassment i think despite be tout as professional Lalit be still unprofessional as its erstwhile hotel Ashok very govt like Same evening we host a large party at Sheraton sorry lalit you miss an opportunity and i can tl you Sheraton in orion mall be light year ahead Will not recommend my usa busines colleague to book in Lalit Luxurious hotel Bedroom be very spacious Buffet be excellent and we be lucky to be there for poolside Sunday Brunch on the lush lawn Hotel staff be hospitable and inquire about the stay frequently we would love to visit again Good place to have meeting in their wide range of hall in different size and able to service and provide good food for hundred of guest in each hall but when it be the room the review be not so good the room doesnt look like you be stay in a star category and look very old there be water clogging and you will have to stand in a pool of water of around 3 to 4 inch while have your bath after a long tiring day have a snandwich from room service and sleep off by 10 pm around 11 45PM be wake up by the doorbell and a room service person be stand with my bill for sandwich ask me to pay by cash immediately i tell him that i cant pay at 11 45PM and that i will speak with the manager i try call up to speak to him over phone for next 45 min but he be very busy probably take good care of the guest in the hall and the only reply be that he will call back within 5 min Next day while check out ask again and they say you can complain through online so conduct meeting and have fun but dont stay there since the room be not worth pay and bad service for room guest if you want rest to recover from flight and be fresh for the next busines day then look for oth hotel stay for 7 night and during 4 night i be dance in my bed due to all kind of party bed be ok food be ok Next time i ll look for well more respectful hotel Hotel be situate next to CM guest house and a golf course it have beautiful lawn and very old tree flora and fauna surround room be small compare to many oth hotel same with buffet spread limited spread but really love their Pastry Shop a must visit if you visit hotel Asian restaurant OKO be way too cool and server authentic Asian cuisine Party area Kitty Ko be the good pub i walk in at the city they should work on noise cancellation in room for those guest who do n t like to party as Kitty Ko be an Terrace pub Health club and Spa Salon Rejuve be ub luxurious there be an India restaurant too do nt try same Hotel staff be always helpful if i do nt like anything exterior nee a repainting especially those area which face pool it look really ugly

the golf course have ample parking space and a great front porch one can enjoy fitnes centre and swimming pool staff be professional and friendly room be bit small and noisy stay in this hotel for 5 day on the Tuesday 31th evening there be a party with such a loud music which go on to 1 Oclock in the night get to sleep be not possible the manager in duty tell us that it would stop but without any result Unbelievable that such can happen we will look for an oth hotel when we comeback to this city they have a Halloween party go on and noone could sleep until 12 in the night as the wall be flimsy and porous the duty manager put his hand up and refuse to do anything the reception start cut call after a while Will never return ever Pathetic experience be to LaLit Ashok for the first time it be a fantastic experience the stay be super comfortable although the amenity provide in the room could be a bit more well the spa Rejuve provide by the hotel be worth mention the treatment provide by them be really one of a kind the treatment be refreshing and awesome definitely recommend for those who want to get away from the busy atmosphere of the rush city it be an interesting stay the reception be very help full security be like any oth but the hotel be old with old room and facility that be say still clean and maintain you will nee to depend on uber a lot for your transportation if you be money orient oth wise the price to go any be from the hotel be expensive make sure you use the meter in the recsha the WiFi be great the spa be wonderful the restaurant be great the headache be too much if they have a party your room will be move with the rhythm Stay be fantastic staff be cooperative and humble overall sanitation and cleanlines be there good art and beutiy ous there connectivity to hotel be good shower and it accessory be good good cupboard staff be good it be great stay at the hotel the warmth in the conduct of raysa and rahil at the reception and Pranav at coffee shop be

grand old dame of busines hotel in Bangalore and provide great room good service especially from the impressive door wallah at the hotel entrance strong gauge goodnes and very helpful the hotel itself be get a bit old in the tooth but be perfectly fine and way better than just adequate and still great value oth new and more upmarket hotel take the gong in term of facility and freshnes but the old fashioned service which be in the hotel s and Lalit s DNA can be rely upon as a sure bet for a good busines stay the restaurant be adequate but not great like its counterpart and new junior sibling in London if you get a good rate the Lalit Ashok will not disappoint i have to stay for almost a month for some official work in Bangalore so choose the Lalit Ashok for its pristine lush green surrounding you ca n t ask for more as far as the location space go the property be huge nestle admist 10 acre plus which be difficult to find in the heart of the city Golf green on opposite of the road so u have nature at its good now come to hotel impress by their hospitality n care Esply when one be stay for a month at time u tend to get overlook but not here the staff here make me feel comfortable beyond word we tend to complain but i gues one should appreciate the good thing also in life especially when people go out of the way to make you feel comfortable some name do come to mind

restaurant and bar be worth visit room be average in upkeep and size we have plan a day trip to Lalit Ashok for our daughter s Birthday and have a wonderful time the hospitality staff go out of their way to make it special for us a special mention to Ms Hema reception and the gardening staff for rescue our kid mini drone from the lush tree that dot the Lalit garden myself and colleague check in Lalit Ashok on 17 09 2017 for busines trip i be work in an organization which only bre laurel to our country around 10 of our people be check in on that day actually our organization only arrange the accomodation during check in time itself staff be slightly unfriendly i have never see such behaviour in Bengaluru hotel i have some problem in wifi connection in my room when i ask about this the lady didnit respond properly then i have myself take almost one hour to solve the problem actually all our expense in the hotel be sponsor by our organization but when we checkout on 20 09 2017 morning 0430 hr the hotel staff ask us to pay then we tell them as per initial booking this be bill to company after so mauch persausaation only the count person verify the detail but they ask us to

apart from the Ballroom we also have the bridal suite book for two night and the hotel provide two oth room grati where our out of town guest could relax keep their bag and change into travel clothe for their flight out of the city it be a wonderful experience overall especially as we be from San Francisco and be not very familiar with the city so if you have a wedding to plan in Bangalore Lalit Ashoka may be just the right venue i find the Lalit Ashok Bangalore be very friendly hotel centrally locate near by to Mg road and Malleshwaram Mejestic bu station and Mejestic railway station International airport be just 33kms away from here you ll find all the hotel staff start from door man till the housekeeping person very friendly and helpful room on high floor provide a great view of the Bengaluru City view highly equipped with all the necessary amenity Ambiance be really good for spend quality time with your love one Hotel staff be really polite and courteous to addres all our need overall a great experience Cheer up Lalit the Lalit hotel have among oth thing be know for their detailing and professionalism both seem to have be miss in this case the cloak room in the room surely need a make over the check in and the check out be chaotic to say the least the car book at the hotel be not ready lead to a delay the time from the hotel to the airport as intimate to us on more than one occasion be totally off the mark the only thing in my view be the location and centrality of this hotel which make it a convenient option to stay the Hospitality and the service part at the hotel be good in all the way the promotion happen at the spa pastry shop Baluchi my favourite restaurant and Oko be really worthy and good value for money the staff everywhere at hotel be very

have all the essential amenity we have lunch and breakfast at their 24 7 Restaurant though the service be good the food be disappointing for lunch we have order pasta with red sauce they get us pasta with white sauce the breakfast do n t have good variety and the food be not fresh even a simple thing like hot chocolate be not up to the mark with so many good 5 star hotel in Bangalore i would rather stay in one of them the stay at lalit ashok be really nice i have an event in this hotel name Aditya birla Everything go well and i would like to thank the hotel staff who actually take care of

garden be worth mention with different colorful flower Thank you guy for the lovely stay we stay in this Property as a Stopover for 2 night on our way to Coorg and i must say this be a nice break from the Hustle and Bustle of Bengaluru not too far from the Commercial Street Majestic Area or the UB City area you be not far from any be the Breakfast spread be really exhaustive and staff be courteous find many trainee around the room be OK Overall we enjoy our stay at the Lalit so w have com here for holiday as this be one of the good hotel in Bangalore the good thing about this hotel be greenery i love to take a walk in the garden in the morning which make me feel fresh and then the lavish breakfast buffet at the coffee shop near pool also would like to mention the staff s at front desk be very polite and friendly i enjoy my stay here and would definitely be come back Wonderful stay in lalit ashok bangalore very good food at baluchi and very friendly staff overall very great stay good

be tasty i would really love to comeback and stay here thank to the entire team who make my stay more comfortable than ever i visit last month i find everything fine but nee to emprove in quality of food and service be good Bangalore be always as usual it be nice place to visit but little traffic be there in bangalore i expect little well than this next time stay for two week decent room quality service lot of greenery good food every single individual offer service always carry smile in his her face Few of them be mentionworthy such as Premankur Roy Saurav Pal Gayatri T and above all Shirshendu Banerjee Management be not ready to offer tailor make solution to its customer if situation demand so the Lalit Ashok be locate in Kumara Krupa road near shivanada cricle very good hotel in citie room bathroom swimming pool be very neat maintenance good and food also very good Must visit this place Lalit Ashok be our last stop in our Coorg sojourn and to say the least i would say i be a bit disappointed the service be very professional but this hospitality industry require mix of professionalism and human touch to achieve the excellence and probably i feel that here second factor be bit out of sync during my whole trip it be the only hotel which charge a full price for an infant suitable meal Boiled Dhal and light Chapatti for me pay for it be not a problem but still a reputed chain like Lalit there should be consideration for infant also Hotel seem a little aged and layout of room depict that only also the room layout be not child friendly all the crockery item and Tea kettle be easily accessible for toddler and we have a harrowing time protect them normally at all oth place i have find them stock at some height not accessible by child also i find one thing very unusual one of the side drawer have Holy book into it it be a noble gesture but again with a small child around who be capable of fidget thru drawer it be a bit of discomfort as we have to continuously protect those Holy text from be tear by the kid in my opinion instead of provide it mandatorily in the room they should give option at the time of check in to provide it if need this be to avoid even any unintentional tearing off disrespect as be in our case towards the holy text Breakfast spread be ok it be not very sumptuous but still sufficient but even after be in busines for so long some minor but important thing like honey for cornflake ketchup etc be miss and have to be ask for Live Juice corner be a revelation so overall i would say that it be an average experience from a Hotel chain which be so reputed Worst Hotel i have stay in Stinky and dirty room non work LCD s dirty bathroom tear curtain when we ask at the Reception to change the room first they deny of have any empty room after tell them we would like to checkout right away then they keep us wait for more than an hour and a half to give an answer we have to call them 7 8 time to check on the statu of our issue i e whether they will change the room or not even the changed room be super pathetic as it have a stale smell as if the room be lock for a week the staff be non courteous it be already 9 45pm so we think of continue our stay rather than search for a New accommodation in an area totally unknown the dinner buffet at 24x7 restaurant be pathetic they hardly have any option the food be flavourless when ask the manager to add spice and rectify the dish he get us burn dish the breakfast be still well but same there very limited option WILL never STAY AT this HOTEL again i stay here for 1 night the room be neat and clean well maintain the hotel be centrally locate Friendly staff stay be very comfortable Dinner and morning breakfast be excellent great value for money this hotel be awesome

service and friendly however i have few minor issue about the hotel first of all be the food the food here be extremely hot Indian which some people may not eat and food selection should be wide especially Arabian food and TV should have wide selection of channel such as Arabic channel since Arabic visitor come here and add few translation selection last day i have a little problem in the

member i interact with and that something special my favourite part be the complimentary jacuzzi and sauna facility make available to all room guest i be impress by the level of hygiene maintain at the spa kudo to the people who work round the clock to ensure it the oth place that i be grateful for be the 24 7 coffee shop which offer a variety of food i can not eat spicy food so it be lovely to have option that be suitable for me Soy milk be available on request and some of the item on offer be mark as eggles lactose free or gluten free the only improvement i would suggest be to offer at least one or two vegan dessert in the buffet the Lalit Ashok hotel have a long history and be an iconic hotel in Bangalore it boast of stunning garden and hedge topiary and a zen garden with some very old tree that be a treat to watch its location right opposite the sprawl golf course be another huge plu that set it apart from oth 5 star in the city and it right next to the Chief Minister s official residence so you can bet it be the safe place in the city but what really set Lalit apart be its homely feel and great attention to detail and its remarkable hospitality whether it be the fresh floral arrangement or the thoughtful bakery art in the patisserie shop and at 24 7 or the remarkable food at Baluchi whether it be the resort like atmosphere by the poolside or the spread out brunch on Sundays or the flicker votive and lantern light in the evening nothing beat the ambience at Lalit new five star may have flashy chandelier and large open lobby but Lalit with its ambience proximity to nature and very warm hospitality have a soulfulnes that oth five star lack A stay here be a most heart warming experience something that will leave you stay with you for a long time it be among the low price 5 star in the city and totally justify that in term of service and room Balcony door wo n t shut close in the room Mold on the shower cabin wall Chalky white water serve at breakfast thing happen but they do n t attempt to make it right after take over from the Government the new Owners be try to keep the grandeur alive and also make it modern they succee to some extent the room be spacious but not grand the food outlet be ordinary the service be about ok though one do nt get a single smile right trough the stay the good be the Filter coffee that keep the Mysore

courteous staff TheBREAKFAST CHOICE be AWESOME very good range Most of the room do not have bathe tub if you want to compromise with old style then not a bad choice a very date property it be in dire need of room renovation and overall cleanup in a city where 5 star hotel pop up every minute there should really be some upgrade do the sale and banquet team be great they go out of their way to help and accommodate if you be look to host an event definitely reach out to them the stay be very cofortable Gayathri be very welcoming and good hospitality Conference be good and food wq excellent

all facility be perfect for a busines clas hotel Reception staff be very friendly and professional from check in to check out be fantastic Breakfast restaurant need speedy response and service Special thank to Ajeesh Madan and Asiya i be so Pissed that i ca n t tell you 1st i find your website some kind of nightmare for me that too for be loyal it be a crime to search and book from your website or to stay with you i hope it not be it i would really appreciate if you could fix your website for provide customer with the real time availability and the price as i have a horrific experience because of your website as i be stay at Lalit in Mumbai and i be horrified to see the price difference between your website and travel agency it be like 90 K INR difference for standard one and not some small amount and then some Lady at the reception pick the phone and tell me when i ask her about extend my stay at Lalit and the difference be again somewhere around 54 K the only reason i choose the Lalit it because i have a wonderful experience during my 1st stay at Great eastern and over another property in Kolkatta and ever since then i try to choose Lalit and even i have reservation at Oberoi s for Bengaluru for about two day which i book in December 16 and it be pay in full because some lady at the Bengaluru lalit tell me that they have some function and she can not not alot me with a room which i understand it however i be check my mail today and i see Lalit be take reservation for the duration i be look for it actually and then i cancel my BOOKING with OBEROI just to STAY with you and eventually your WEBSITE DOESN T HAVE a ROOM to OFFER and some STUPID TRAVEL AGENCY be ABLE to SELL your room to PEOPLE and this show the REAL INCOMPETENCE of your WEBSITE why DON T you just SHUT it off rather than have one as it not USEFUL and i LOOSE my POINTS and my PATIENCE every TIME i BOOK with TRAVEL agent because again you DON T HAVE a SIMILAR POLICY like oth hotel chain its a good and spacious 5star hotel in heart of city it have big lawn to host party and function that the reason there be no peace particularly on weekend i suggest never take this hotel on weekend i have check in on Saturday evening room be good spacious clean room service good Food be good but expensive Saturday night there be party go on in hall in Ground floor with loud music entire hotel be vibrate with bas and woofer i complain about it my room be shift to 4th floor still there be noise but much less they say it Party music will continue till 1 be till that time i have to test my patience on sunday again there be some Industrial conference in which many minister have come again it be noisy chao and passage be choake Difficult to get in and out of the hote Complete traffic jam inside and outside hotel i do a mistake of take this hotel there be hotel available at half the price where much peace and solace i could have get i could not sleep or take prop rest in the hotel Hotel have a good swimming pool and garden but i could not enjoy it as there be so much crowd and they charge extra 500 for sit in the pool side for tea coffee i have take this hotel see that it have big garden greenery and will be peaceful to rest after my tiring day schedule but it be not weekend be always like this noisy in this hotel Hotel be a bit old but spacious Staff be very courteous and helpful especially Pravin at the front desk Breakfast can be improve but again the staff be very attentive and take care of special need room be nice and clean bed be comfortable with a good choice of different kind of pillow overall a decent stay and well worth the money i again be at this hotel on busines as with every time the place be very relaxing to be in with the green surrounding and the gym and the pool but most of all it the people with smile service that make it nice Good to see the attrition rate at this place be low as i keep meet the same employee over year Must specially mention Ms Puja Mallick part of the hotel team who be very polite and helpful to make the guest feel welcome back to the hotel be visit Bengaluru for a medical conference and have book the hotel 8 month in advance and pay the full amount 2 month in advance 2 day before the conference get a call from the hotel that one wing of the hotel the AC be not work so shift us to the Radisson Blu Atria Hotel really unprofessional approach sound more like they have overbooke during the conference and start shift guest else where the only good thing be that the Lalit staff be readily available at the Radisson Blu and the shifting be painless but really the late shifting of us leave a bad taste any way Pravin from Lalit be available 24 x 7 at Radisson Blu which be a great help never come back to the Lalit it be old and have no character really need refurbishment visit the place for a conference do nt actually stay there but my friend do and so be hang there all the time something be just amiss food serve during the conference be lack in variety nothing to say about on taste room be like cheap quality 2 3 star hotel room decor be mundane bore concept of the room be really pathetic do nt give a feeling of comfort the architecture on the floor be insipid no prop arrangement be make during lunch hour when the sun be beat down have to eat the meal in the garden area get cook serve staff just do nt seem right be poorly dress management fault i gues ice on the cake lot of room be cancel at the last moment leave my colleague in the lurch run around for last minute accomodation my advice much well quality 5 star stay away i stay here for 2 night on busines travel expect good stay and facility however it have be poor experience it also rip off first and most important internet be not free now after you pay it extremely poor bandwidth Restaurant have sign meeting will be charge rs 500 per person per hour room be good but no carpet in room or passage which make noise when someone be walk in lobby overall for the amount of money i pay it not worth recently i get to visit this hotel to accompany my brother who be present some cardio thoracic paper in recently conduct 3 day cardio thoracic seminar at Hotel Lalit Ashok i nee to use the lady loo where only 2 commode be there and both be have open door next to the big seminar hall and to my utt surprise i realize i get

good location half of the hotel be under construction and room allot to me by state that room have an outside view it have a view of big garbage storage very disappointing to Stay at that hotel by pay an unbelievable high price Will never suggest to stay there poor UX we have two separate one night stay our room on first occasion be OK though the bathroom be rather snug Service in Monsoon be really quite strange part of which can probably be put down to communication difficulty in English drink order at the same time come at different time only part of our order be take before the waiter move on to another table but the food be fine Breakfast buffet be OK on our second stay we have a refurbish room which be well cleaner look with more powerpoint again service be pretty patchy sometimes very good as may have be expect in an hotel which purport to be 5 star sometimes really poor again possibly due to lack of English skill in the staff the overall impression be that although the infrastructure be reasonable the service need quite a lot of attention this property be centrally locate and a nice place to stay thank to the GM Mr Ajit for the lovely hospitality room be quite big and comfortable recently they have renovate the room and you can even relax at the big balcony attach with the room the i bar Aqua the pool side and the restaurant be well maintain and the atmosphere

experience in this hotel it be near to main shopping mall restaurant bookstore etc also the employee be very proactive and polite it be a five hotel start with a reason price if we compare with other have a one night stay in the Park Bengaluru on a recent busines trip and have a mixed experience the hotel room though comfortable be quite date and this be especially visible in the bathroom and its fixture Room amenity be in par with any good hotel functional and adequate but not a standout Location obviously be a plu but fade in front of some the more posh neighbouring hotel the one thing that be a show killer and should be account for be the extremely loud disc music play through the night and people scream and talk loudly right below in the ground floor disc this can be quite discomforting and unpleasant if you be try to catch some sleep anytime before 1am this be an acute problem at low level front face room even though the duty manager do offer to change the room when i complain and be receptive of the complaint its be simply a hassle to change a room in the middle of the night Management need to be cognizant of such issue and have well sound proofing and pro actively communicate such issue during check in a decent stay mar by very bad design and lack of thought for the guest Som good hotel for busines traveller and tourist love the ambience and service Thank you for such an amazing hospitality Will definitely visit again Food quality be great and location be best suited 1 M G Mall be just opposite of the road well maintained and clean Hotel not very big but reasonably well decor we lead out breakfast over all a good experience well behaved Staff Location of the hotel be the good part its in the MG road which be almost center of the city i have a chance to stay at The Park Bengaluru from 30 Oct to 02 Nov 18 the booking proces be smooth and the Reservation Section be proactive i arrive around 11 00 PM at night and the Check in be smooth the food have good amount of variety as well as taste Mr Ashwin at the Restaurant be very responsive i also happen to particularly like their Starters and Sweet Dish with the buffet dinner the Rooms be clean and house keeping be effecient the hotel be locate at MG Road which be in the heart of the City overall i have an excellent experience the only hotel of the eight we stay at that have a balcony and a door to it that actually open unfortunately the traffic noise once we open it prevent us use the balcony we be grateful that we be tell this be a non smoking hotel and it actually be Security screening of baggage on arrival and a walk through a metal detector make us a little nervous upon arrival but this be normal for all top hotel Staff be very efficient we go there in the morning to be sure a room would be ready for us at 12 but when we get there after one the room be n t ready we be welcome with a complimentary cup of coffee and the room make available very quickly good air quality in room Linens in the room be top quality as be the toiletry Laundry be pricey but return early as request without the double fee for express laundry pay with skymile ofter get us a low category of room but we feel this be n t so at the Park Be aware of the shark at the gate who promise ride for 50 r to the shopping center and that turn into 200 r by the time you reach your destination it be 50 r only if you go to the store of their choice and buy something there these guy and their vehicle be not associate with the Park hotel itself the hotel have great ambiance sup foyer very good front desk and housekeeping staff there be a shopping center across the road which be convenient Restaurant staff be very attentive and we get our non spicy meal at night which be a relief the restaurant have old household item display on one wall which be interesting a great outdoor seating area Wi fi go off overnight and password have to be re enter the next day at the front desk we find the breakfast buffet average compare to the oth 6 hotel we stay in their Indian dessert too surprise us by not be up to par with expectation we try 2 3 and they be all the same which be surprising for a hotel of this caliber overall a very good experience stay with family for 3 day during a weekend the location be perfect just a short distance from Brigade Road and the prime shopping or entertainment place in Bangalore Walkable distance to the metro station so if public transport be need it can also be use you get everything nearby we be there during no alcohol day hence there be no night party in the hotel i be tell that the night life and pub in the hotel be very good now for the hotel itself for the price range it good however not the good example the room balcony up keeping be not great as

the order but forget to deliver seem like only care about family busines traveler be take for grant some decision in life bre in a sense of Pride and warmth that linger on this be one of those moment as we celebrate my daughter s First Holy Communion Brunch Party by the pool side we instantly connect with the property and the people who interact make us feel special by make this event a grand succes the pool side be a perfect setting on a warm summer afternoon with mild shower bless the party towards the end the team lead by their senior personnel Mr Sharma Satish Naresh Ram Yash Abhilash

we want to thank the entire Park team for make this occasion a memorable one and wish them the very good the Park prove to be big disappointment in term of service and hospitality much to my surprise First shock be find a rusted dry up use tea bag in my electric kettle at 6am in the morning when one look forward to a cup of hot tea Staff be kind enough to serve me a readymade tea as complimentary know it be a big goof up Second shock be my colleague s room be leave uncleaned until 4pm despite him remind the reception early morning about remove the previous day s plate etc after i point out the lapse the Front Office manager get into the act i must admit he come to my room apologise and promise to take action Full mark to him but the fact remain the hotel fall much much short of the brand the Park in India and should be avoid for the price charge in comparison with service offer my husband and i stay at this hotel for two night and we have such an amazing time Everyone at this hotel be unbelievably helpful start from front desk to house keep to room service there be never a time when we feel that this hotel be not worth our money Clean room good linen quality and clean bathroom with well sufficient toliterie that you may require during your stay the staff be amazing especially Robin Bellboy who would always greet us and help us with anything we need Rishab Housekeeper be a sweetheart who would always check if we be have a comfortable stay and if we need anything else in the room we feel like royalty and very welcome with such amazing service Thank you Park for such an amazing hospitality and yes my review title be inspire by your match box Creative nicely locate in the cebter opposite a small mall and about 45 min from airport i would decribe it as an aged in grace boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff and an designed Ambiente room be small but again nicely furnished Make sure you take a room second floor and up to have a balcony and be not that affect by the music from the small and popular bar downstairs the bar close at 1 am but the little noise until be manageable one of my bad experience at a so call 5 star hotel Unhygienic unsafe they have give room to these young single guy with all kind of activity happen in the hotel Shady feeling i could n t sleep the entire night and check out of the hotel the very next morning Nothing to praise i wonder how this hotel get good review its shocking to know that how this hotel be 5star lift full of insect and so be room the hotel do nt have enough twin bed if not so they promise to place an extra bed at no extra charge and later say it would be chargeable very unprofessional untrained staff Will never even think of return here Believe me even 3 star budget hotel be well to stay with well facility and service this hotel be middle of the city and it be worth stay and value fo money morning they have big breakfast option and food be very good easily accessible through out the city good

know for a busines hotel but i must say this hotel be not upto the expectation the staff be friendly but they lack in offer service the conference hall be not that great in compare to their oth hotel the food and room be ok my experience with the hotel start rather poorly i try reach the front desk through phone a few time to confirm my checkin time but no one pick up the phone finally when i ask to speak to the Duty Manager i be able to reach someone Check in be slow i be ask to wait while they confirm that the room be ready i have request for a HDMI cable in advance but that have not be keep ready Someone bring it to the room later in the afternoon and tell me that i could have it only for an hour or so as it be the ONLY cable in the hotel Imagine i be give a terrace suite on the 2nd floor which be rather nice Room be spacious Large foyer with place to keep luggage also a minibar live room with couch table computer table Bedroom with a queen sized bed chair wardrobe etc both room have acces to a large balcony which have a breakfast table lounge chair but it be too hot to venture out besides there be no privacy Bath be also large and well light with tub and a separate shower area the latt be very small and a largish person would find it difficult to have a prop shower Good amenity in the bathroom AC be good as be the wi fi 2 HD tv one in each room overall the amenity place in the room and bath be very good however the room smell of cigarette smoke despite this be a non smoking room Service be rather slow i ask for sugar free sachet and that take 3 call and almost 30 min to get if you re plan to stay here on a sat night be warn the hotel throw a disco every Sat evening which literally shake the entire hotel especially the one face the pool and this go on till 1 am Location of the hotel be excellent in the CBD just off MG Road opposite a swanky mall near a metro station i love the stay it be peaceful friendly staff and the room be exceptionally good too i will always look forward to stay at this hotel they do offer some tasty food at the restaurant downstairs we have and emergency situation be need of fresh cloth after last night party we just call up

staff be really friendly polite and helpful and a breakfast with fresh fruit make my day Air conditioning temperature in room and oth very small detail like pillow placement coffe maker placement we keep in mind by the staff for a wonderful experience i be very fuzzy about the cleanlines of bathroom however this place never give me a chance to complain even once indeed a GREAT PLACE to STAY Nice stay hotel be very good Friendly staff Clean and hygienic room be maintain properly Food be of great taste Would surely like to visit again and strongly recommend to friend and family try this hotel for the first time and i must i be highly impressed i stay at this hotel for couple of day and the experience be awesome the hotel be quite clean with good spacious n comfortable room all oth facility be at pr as available at all oth hotel Staff be forthcoming all the staff eag to serve you better right from check to check out the dinner buffet be quite well and have almost everything what do nee especially when you be out of your home no doubt food be tasty Housekeeping service be the good of all i mean it my lady attendent Remi she be very caring and helpful she ensure to clean by room impeccably deliver all my stupid request on time and show some serious interest in know her guest hat off this hotel have handpicke staff all around and they be the one who be the real asset of the hotel Fancy lobby big room and shine marble be just an eye wash my genuine recommendation to ppl read this review Try the PARK i have a great experience during my stay the hotel be clean and provide you great hospitality the hotel staff be very helpful and will guide you throughout your stay the hotel provide you all the facility the food be great with attractive menu this be my third visit and this time be with my friend the room be with new flooring and look nice and clean i get a room with balcony with pool view Excellent party place and enjoy a lot in i bar Great music and food we be welcome with tequila shot and it be something different and check in be smooth i have be stay very frequently at the Park over the last decade during which i write a couple of review already and even consider this place as my second home whenever i be in the city but thats be mainly because of the wonderful staff out here and the fantastic service they provide with a highly personal touch but a property need to also make sure it doesnt degrade on oth aspect this hotel use to be the poster child of Chic Boutique hotel back in the day and be the trendsetter of style and clas without hurt your wallet but all that have be slowly erode over the last few year i have share my observation with the employee during most of my stay while the staff include the sale manager and front office folk collect feedback so willingly and eagerly the property seem to be age faster than they themselves be age while they be helpless in prevent it the air conditioning doesnt work in most room as they should be keep the room warm and unsuitable for a nights rest the bathroom and floor tile in the room be fall apart very frequently despite their constant attempt to fix them and finally the Television channel i have be complain about this for the last 5 year or so but most room have such poor satellite reception half the channel choke and dont even work most of the time so dont expect too much entertainment from the moody television but why do i still come back and will probably visit again it be mainly because of the staff who be more of a family to me than employee of the hotel especially member like DIMPY from front desk welcome us like we have come back to our retreat how can you let go of this familiarity and go stay in a plastic hotel but then it be high time the management wake up and fix the hotel LOCATION Fantastic location right next to MG Road DINE DRINK the Bar on site be one of the hip place to hang out esp on a Wednesday Sunday night the restaurant be not bad either but they can surely do better on their South Indian offering especially consider they be Bangalore of all place ROOM i have stay in a few room 204 205 415 etc and each of them have their own shortcoming VIEW the 204 205 room have lovely view of the city with a great balcony to chill at SIZE reasonably spacious room AIR CON Horrible AirConidtioner that never manage to maintain a cool temperature and need to be gutte out and fix soon BED Comfortable bed that play the expect part to put me to sleep BATHROOM Stand in shower toiletry the highlight of the property wonderful KAMA brand Ayurvedic luxurious cosmetic Heavenly shower facility a claustrophic date age basement gym with a Prison gym feel and not mean for anyone who be really not discipline about work out the machine and weight be so old they be actually hazardous and can potentially cause injury the Dumbell fall apart more than a couple of time during my workout the pool look lovely but unusable most of the time as they dont even bother to clean the leave that fill up the surface every day SERVICE Friendly staff that take care of all my need with a smile and make us feel pampered and well take care of Special Shout out to Front office folk and the Bellhop guy the Service and staff be the VERY RESON why i KEEP come back again and again Take them out and this property would be dead soon how WIRED you WILL BE Slow speed Wi Fi that work well all over the property but quite sad consider this be a busines hotel in a Cyber city where you would expect fast speed Plasma TV screen dish out dozen of channel span sport new music movie and a wide variety of entertainment in multiple language but the TV reception be so poor most channel dont work this be my stay at the Park and i just ca nt stop myself write a review its a beautiful hotel right from the entrance they have a plant shop at the main porce which be quite uniqe and awesome Vintage look of the lobby be bit old but acceptable Reception staff be very helpful and caring room be very clean and well maintain thank to my Housekeeper Prashant he seriously put extraordinary efforrt to make our stay comfortable Wide spread of the breakfast buffet Thanks everyone for make our staff comfortable and enjoyable overall a good experience the room be neat however for a base tariff the room look very ordinary consider it be a 5 star property the food be great the nightclub have lose its sheen the kind of crowd that enter be pathetic and a need to filter the crowd be extremely important as that reflect on the reputation of a hotel be a regular to this property for the last 15 year i feel it have go down a few notch in term of the crowd at the nightclub i highlight this point because for expat traveler unwind post work be an important feature and a decisive factor on the stay Good Luck it be my 1st experience and it be just pleasant the staff be very helpful and actually i arrive little bit early and the room where not ready but the front desk staff try their good and accommodate me as early as possible and the welcome amenity be really attractive i would like to thank Mr Niranjan Mr Harish Mr Felix and the gal who do check in my friend also like it very well and they will also recommend to other and i will be back soon Thank you so much guy for everything special thank to Mr Niranjan for a great gesture be a really disappointing stay there be no alcohol available during my stay the room be good but what be the point when you can not enjoy Food be OK the restaurant opposite the hotel yatucha and Tao have amazing food they be too good i stay here for a night due to office work Location be good since its right across the mall however due to this i could hear music beat till late at night from a club in the mall which be quite disturbing Hotel staff upgrade me to a presidential room but still room size be average i believe hotel building be quite old hence floor of the room be quite wear out Hotel staff be helpful but little slow one thing i want to appreciate be that i leave ring in the room and leave i get a call from th hotel in next 5 10 min and get it back really thankful for that enjoy this little hotel and their daily breakfast be fantastic though it appear to be a little bit old everything work just fine and the customer service be very good as far as i be concern this be a very good value they also provide a couple of Meeting room for busines purpose and have a nice pool Room be good but not smell fresh they should check the room before give to the guests check in experience be not good staff be good but not organize all over everything be fine and good keep it up this be our 3rd time here and the quality of food have always be great wether in room dining or breakfast the food be completely worth it thank to the Chef the room be moderate Nothing much to speak about Comfotable bed but very small space and the bed design with iron bar around i do n t understand completely it feel unwanted for the layout of the room Great housekeeping no question ask Dilligient refill of what be require so that a bonu when stay in for more than a day as this hotel have a club you nee to be watchful of the noise so the room you select be totally your skill Front office manager be quite understanding and accomodating but the staff be not on the same line as all hotel they work in shift so what you think be well communicate and agree with front office staff may not necessarily be what you get the next day prop communication be not there at all have to argue a lot to get thing in place some staff be helpful and some totally not so good luck there Location of the hotel be fabulous so get around be a breeze SPA look questionable to me so no comment there Pool be moderate do n t use it even once during our stay but as it outdoors it a great place to sit around and dine or coffee there overall i like the place i think it great value Let s start with the positive Location be nice the lobby look decent and check in be easy then you take the elevator let s say to the 2nd floor and you re in for a surprise it like you re in a different world the carpet in the corridor be so old and dirty they re curl up on the side the room would have be ok if any of the furniture be not damage or heavily scratch one of the lamp be miss a piece that expose all the cable the toilet be plain dirty even after you flush the water come out brown and the smell be disgusting TV do n t work they have n t sweep the floor there be obvious ball of hair and something else that i do n t even know what it be also a small spider be hang out in my bed in the mini bar there be a half empty water bottle presumably from the previous guest when they ask me if thing be OK i ask whether my floor have n t be refurbish and they say all room be the same so my strong advice be to find a different place to stay this place need a LOT of money invest to clean it up place new carpet furniture oth colleague stay in the hotel at the same time and have similar experience Hotel be good at the center of the city with mall cinema around Food be good but service have n t improve since my visit Front desk have to remind multiple time Hotel be also old and you suddenly see door not get lock etc the hotel be good the service render be excellent the staff David be friendly and helpful they have a wide spread of breakfast the hotel be very near commercial street for shopping Opp there be 1 mg Mall Overall gd place for shopping and food this be a old property at the heart of the city with excellent service and good and variety of food Breakfast here be a good experience with variety of cuisine there be also a heritage attach to this hotel since the addres go back in time Courteous staff spacious room but the room in general nee some sprucing up the airport transfer be very well plan the chauffeur Pradeep be polite punctual and extremely courteous the food option be simply great Love to be here again i be stay there from 15th february 2018 to 17th february 2018 Hotel be very near to mg road room be spacious but need upgradtion i get a balcony room with pool view there be a disco in hotel also be crowdy on friday saturday i really enjoy be there Overall very good experience i be there only for one night but they surprise me by a free upgrade and the terrace room look really nice at the city ambiance the property be ideally locate and the dinner spread be amazing Nice people and i would recommend we come to stay with the park Bangalore after so long time it be amazing before i ask she serve me my coffee she still remember my coffee Thank you Bhagyashri you be do great we definitely come again and again we arrive at about 10 pm in Bangalore for a 4 day stay at the hotel we have be travel for week and be quite jet lagged and tired our first night be good with a quiet peaceful night but little do we know that it would be our last at this hotel as of the 10 be the next day the hotel hold a 3 day music festival with blare music from 10 be till 8 pm each day for the Indian festival of Holi colour festival that would have be fine except that the hotel do not have sound proof room and we do not get any rest during the day and have to leave the hotel to get some peace and quiet we be never tell about this even in advance or even at checkin and didnt know how long it would last after two solid day of blare music through 6 large speaker and drunk teenager all around we have enough and complain they offer us a room change and a massage which sound good except that their spa be right besides the Event venue and the noise be unbearable as we hear djs play house music as we get our relaxing massage the room on the oth side of the hotel be no well as it too wasnt sound proof and when the festival end for the day at 8 pm the nightclub across the road kick off till 1 be keep us up for each night of our stay i ask for the General manager to get in touch with me to explain themselves and to find out if they be jn the event management busines on in hotel management but to date no one have bother to get in touch with us this be classify as a 5 star hotel but we walk tired angry and even though the day to Day staff be fantastic the people make the decision at the top be try to cash in on drink sale at event at the cost of hotel guest i dont usually write review but i have to do this as this be somthe that should be know by the public and apparently trip advisor be the place to share these experience Excellent location service and value for money Can improve on cleanlines during the breakfast fly be there in the hall the fitting in the room may nee for a well maintenance my request for a quiet room be entertain all the staff member be very helpful we stay for 3 night room bite small but facility wise reasonable Food buffet be good Staff be friendly the only issue we face be we go when there be Holi party on all 3 day too much noise on last day noise from some machine didnt let us sleep peacefully they should work on soundproof the room but overall good stay this hotel be locate centrally and that the good part about it it seem like a great property but the upkeep be questionable somehow you get a feeling that hygiene be compromise the service be okay and the quality of food at breakfast be just about average it be not very difficult to make perfect Idli s not get them right can definitely drag you down particularly if one be in Bangalore Rest everything else about this hotel be just about average choose this place if you do n t have any oth choice in the same budget i check in this hotel on a late afternoon on Holi day 2nd Mar 18 and to my horrible nightmare i find that the hotel management for some cheap marketing strategy allow a Holi party at the entrance passage of the hotel for 3 day start from 10 be till 8 pm i have to get down on the road and walk with my luggage from the exit gate and some sideways to get acces to the lobby though the security help Music be on for this long hour at the high decibel without any consideration of the resident as if they have no priority it be horrible experience and i want to know who be that geniu at the hotel management who can think of to his wide dream such noisy mes without consider the fall out to the guest i SHALL personally URGE owner of the HOTEL and SEE to it that in FUTURE no SUCH event CAN TAKE PLACE without consider INCONVENIENCE of the RESIDENT guest you must think about los of future customer by go for such short term gain i be write now from my room no 310 opening towards the entrance and believe me the sound and noise be simply unbearable i raise complain and call the floor manager to room to show him my plight he be apologetic and try to lessen my pain by take another room on Level 4 on the poolside which he claim will be quiet to his embarrassment that room be no well and i understand they have similar noisy party on the pool side as well i curse him and my decision to stay at this hotel i have travel to some 30 odd country in last 32 year and have stay at least in about 500 plus hotel at the heart of their festival never i have experience such nuisance in any busines hotel not a holiday resort of the stature of the Park Group that to in a professional city like Bengaluru unfortunately Trip Advisor App do not allow to load audio clip else i would have load one to share my plight have start with the negative note which i be sure the top management will never allow in future let me move to the review of the property the location be great at the heart of the MG Road it be more a busines hotel though after my current experience i doubt Checkin be smooth i have my room on 3rd floor 310 which have a balcony though it be the cause of my pain courtesy Holi Party Room though small in size be tastefully decorate with poster bed give an antique look Mahogany coloured furniture and wooden floor go well with the theme it have all amenity that you expect on a similar property like wifi in room safe refrigerator flat TV tea and coffee making facility the en suite toilet be very good with bath tub quality toileterie Breakfast be include and be serve in Lobby Level Coffee shop and be quiet elaborate bar the disturbance that i experience due to the Holi party i have a comfortable stay this be my second visit to the hotel early be about 3 month earlier bar the facade which be quite old it a compact very nice hotel very comfortable room it be nice to be welcome once again by the GM room be spacious Breakfast be excellent and with a huge choice Internet be fabulous Staff extremely courteous and polite any minor problem they be willing to sort it out quickly there be nothing much to start with View from the room be n t great but the disadvantage of be in the center of town Location be excellent the check in be quick and the hotel be ideally locate we happen to be there on a weekend Housekeeping do a good job they provide a small bowl of almond and a flower on the bed very thoughtful Wifi speed be good and the it person be helpful in connect 3 device we be give a room on the 3rd floor just above the Disco the noise level be extremely high and it will go upto 3 be in the morning the hotel staff and manager be totally not bother about the peaceful sleep of its guest you have to keep shout at the staff inc GM to get thing do only on the last date they change our room and we have a sound sleep we notice a very casual attitude towards most of the staff receptionist bell boy etc the room be ok and need a major upgrade with heavy sound proofing glass we do n t have food here as we feel the buffet breakfast be very expensive Rs 750 hence we decide to eat elsewhere Overall a very poor quality stay Will not select this place next time i stay in Park on 24 th February 2018 i be wake at 9 00 AM with a sound of bang bang bang and drill start work over my head it seem its come form nearby room on upp floor i immediately call reception and request them to look into the issue but nothing happen for next 15 minute then i again call and again they say they will look into the issue i be near the level of loose my patience but nothing happen then i again call after another 15 minute front office attend by a guy name Harish i speak in a very hard tone to connect to the duty manager and i be connect to a guy name Marvin again he say i will look into the matter i say i have book a hotel room and that too a five star not a workshop room from last 45 minute i could not understand why you people can not locate and stop the sound from where it be come he say i be try after 5 minute door bell ring i think may be somebody from hotel have come to apologise and now the noise will stop but it be house keep department ask if i have some laundry to be wash i ask that girl from where this sound be come she immediately reply from second floor some renovation work be go on when every one know about this except duty manager and front office first be they should not allot room next to renovation even if they do they should not start the work when they know guest be inside even if the work be start they should immediately stop after the first complain only but despite my numerous call i be annoyed and frustrated but nothing corrective measure take by hotel staff i can not do anything else oth than share my pain full experience and request the management to look into the matter and it should not be repeat with anyone else i check out hotel at 11 be Height of incompetence be at check out they say you have a telephone bill to be pay i say please share the detail the staff start tell me the number and timing i say i do not but he say the log say this time then he realise that its his duty manager number when they connect me to him i really feel the height of foolishnes while deal with the staff Comfortable room and good service Great location near MG Road and the metro with a big shopping mall opposite we order in room dining service and the food arrive quickly and it be tasty Breakfast buffet be good Good Hotel with well mannered staff both at the reception and the restaurant willing to help the guest voluntarily both their restaurant be at the lobby level almost seamless offer the choice of seat inside or in the open centrally locate in the heart of Bengaluru on M G Road it be still a quiet place to relax both for the busines and leisure traveller not a very high fi hotel but offer all basic amenity in compact clean room this hotel be ideally suit for traveller want to explore the downtown by walk do window shopping try out the various eatery and bar on M G ROAD you also have the connectivity of the Metro Train service with the station near by the restaurant serve both Indian Continental menu with one of their restaurant specialize in Italian Cousine the plus point for me stay at this hotel be its location right there in the heart of the city amidst all fuzz buzz room be clean and keep awesome big thank to the Housekeeping dept Hotel staff be courteous helpful and accommodating Food be delicious and pan different cuisine Last time i have mention that there be bit of renovation need look like a bit have change but lot more need to be do further all in all my stay be awesome and value for money i be have a horrendous experience in the Park Hyderabad and be a little sceptical about the Park Bangalore but Ms Priya Paul and crew just give me a wonderful experience B lore Great room great interior with fresh flower spacious washroom fully load minibar nice staff it be all perfect Clean white bed linen towel floor mat it be the good and they charge me only 4900 it be above 7000 in the park Hyderabad Room be huge with a living room spacious balcony and a foyer i be really talk about the room not about house hotel apartment Hotel Apartment culture be rare in India there be a wooden table and chair in the balcony you can sit there idle work or have food i think pic will speak louder than my word please see my pic for the management 1 Lobby do n t have enough seat 2 no water faucet in toilet just ok place to stay it be basically an Business hotel you will get all the import amenity Good thing be it be in the heart of Bangalore city its in MG Road for all the aspect this place be very near Great food great room smack in the middle of a busy city it loud but if you re look for a local feel this be it have acces to a balcony be easy and the hotel staff be more than willing to make you feel comfortable it the second year of conference and this be a suitable place for large number however this time the food quality be poor in feedback could see good improvement on next day room be good good Fitness centre and Spa Disappointing stay at The Park Bangalore at 10 pm at night i ask to move room because the music from the nightclub Aqua below be so loud it feel like it be come from the wall of my room the staff at the front desk be accommodate but i wonder what would have happen if there wasnt another room available one small beer at Aqua be 600 rupee i half expect to get a share in the brewery it come from there be definitely well bar nightclub in Bangalore which dont charge anywhere near this for drink the experience be out of this world the food be to die for the service be quick and dependable the staff friendly and efficient the reception warm and comfortable the location be at the good place possible the room be cute and comfy simply love it an excellent location from where to experience the madnes of Bangalore close to large shopping centre and good restaurant our only issue be a rather noisy party hold in a function room which go on until 2 am the hotel have warn us and move us to a room well away from the party but bas go through wall like a hot knife through butter the property be locate very centrally right opposite 1 MG Road Mall the food breakfast be impressive both taste and spread the staff at front office housekeeping and restaurant be good the bar be also nice amenity in the room be standard however the room size be a little small Would have expect a slightly big room this hotel be a big disappointment our recent stay at this hotel January 2 to 4 to begin with the entrance of the hotel be not welcome at all i think we be enter from a back door the room be so bad not even any OK standard the bathroom be in a bad condition any one can fall come in and out of bathtub the FIXTURES in the bathroom be loose the breakfast be ok but the music in the breakfast room be terrible in the morning rather than play soft music the disco music be loud will never stay again and will tell friend the same WASTE of MONEY Excellent location hospitality of the team Shijo be the good House keep team be very kind and polite Overall great ambiance and more amazing team Food be very good too i be sure a lot of people will find it the same first stop on our trip to India have fly into Bangalore airport arrive early in the morning Comfortable room but no view Clean toiletry provide Staff friendly and helpful Main problem be the price of food and drink compare with oth place we stay in drink be three or four time what we pay elsewhere Food be OK but nothing exceptional and once again more than double what we pay in oth hotel for more exciting food ok for a one night stay but not a lot to see in Bangalore itself we be stay on the top floor of the hotel above the entrance the room itself be very nice comfortable but unfortunately the music from the nightclub on the ground floor keep us awake when we call staff be entirely uninterested they be more interested in tell us that the nightclub be famous after 2 hour of speak to the hotel about the music we be offer another room on the oth side of the hotel but the music be still audible enough to disturb sleep if you be plan to stay any night from a wed to Saturday be prepare for loud music until at least 1 am a great place to stay Comfortable room spacious good bed to rest and great toileterie Good food wide spread live counter attentive personnel and fast replenishment with odd choice do for you only Nice book to read right at the heart with quick transport to place to go Value for money deal enjoy my stay as mention the location be very convenient Bang in the middle of the city the gym be good with adequate facility Breakfast be ok more South Indian dish expect Problem be with upkeep of the room grant they use STP recycled water for bathroom but the smell be too bad BEDBUGS ca nt expect this in a hotel of this clas i wake up with right shoulder totally red very clean room and bathroom well maintain House keep staff and receptionist be very courteous the swimming pool get

and helpful love their breakfast the room be very good and clean however the TV remote do n t work this mean i could never switch it on also the bath tub lack cleanlines for a five star property i think the quality of the bath tub should be much well one of our favorite while visit Bangalore Ideal place if you have thing to do around MG Road not far from shopping area like Commercial Street lot of option for restaurant we always park our Car and find it easy to travel by auto due to traffic Excellent food nearby at the Fort Kochi Restaurant opposite to the hotel on the 5th Floor of LIDO Mall if you fancy good Kerala food weekend be noisy because of the loud music from the pub on the ground floor locate in one of the most accessible area of Bengaluru the Park provide a unique blend of calm and the regular city hustle bustle Spacious room with an even large balcony and with a staff ever so courteous make sure that the stay be comfortable and memorable the dinner buffet comprise of an

Smooth check in experience with clean comfortable room Will strongly recommend and visit this hotel again this hotel be locate in a prime location the staff be very helpful and the food be good an old hotel but well maintain the staff try their good to display it to be a new hotel and succee in their aim the room be not very big but reasonably spacious the toiletry supply be very limited if you be two two bath towel and two hand towel Bath soap be also only to the requirement no lavish five star supply there be no driver room if you go with a driver you have to look in for a separate place for his night stay definitely value for the price pay i love this hotel and i stay here whenever i come to Bangalore the service be consistent and they take care of me very well the location be the big positive of this place it always value for money cheer stay here for 4 night in a pool face room the room be spacious neat the washroom could have be well stay here on the weekend with my 6 year old daughter it be noisy till about 1 be as we could hear loud music from the ibar the discotheque the staff be warm friendly the breakfast be serve at the MONSOON restaurant which be very cramped congested there be hardly any space here as we have to wait on almost everyday for a table the breakfast spread be big enough but the taste be just average with almost the same dish every day with 1 or 2 exception the option for healthy juice be very good the location of this hotel be just right with 1 mg mall bang opposite the hotel there be two restaurant MONSOON ITALIA as i say early MONSOON restaurant s seating be very unimpressive even for dinner its more like a passage path for the discotheque crowd we like the ITALIA better overall a very good stay my room be too good very spacious with day room and a very spacious washroom beautifully decorate the staff be very good the food be great unfortunately the swimming pool be under maintainnce hence could not enjoy it overall a a very good stay the location of the hotel be in the city and hence you have acces to mall just across the road and various oth market and shop i have be stay with Park Hotels group for last 25 year they really take care of their guest and keep a record of preference you dont have to repeat when you visit next time which not many hotel do it it be one of the good centrally locate hotel General Manager be a very helpful and customer orient person you feel at home in this hotel i really want to thank the General Manager personally but couldnt meet him coz he be also go towards aqua and i be with my frnd too well it be a Wednesday evening and i go with 2 of my frnd to i bar we think since its not a weekend shouldnt be a problem in entry but the manager ask for cover charge now for someone who doesnt drink alcohol cover charge doesnt really make sense we request the manager at entrance but he be rigid follow rule Thats the time when we hear this man stand beside the manager and tell him to allow us well thats a different case that the cover be 3k and we end up pay 6k only for booze in all but what i want to thank the GM for be his eye to differentiate the client probably cover charge would be not only to secure busines but also to ensure that the right people come in he be there to help us in that situation which matter a lot for us one question that come in my mind be If i be alone and dont drink alcohol i ca nt think of go to i bar bcz of course then i alone wouldnt drink of the cover charge value Reason why this come in my mind be since i like the place so much and its a stone throw distance from my residence i really want to go there almost every week or May be twice a week which would be a fix busines for the hotel even though at low price but bcz every time GM wouldnt be there to help its not possible Thank you the park be ideally locate at mg rd opp mg 1 mall its a fab location with shopping restaurant n theatre all close by the hotel have a grt bar and pool Food and service be good Room be spacious and clean Bathroom need little upgrade though although i stay for a night i still could find few wonderful difference that surprise me and make my happy

bad Room be not neat neither clean and to top it of if you go to the wash room the shower and tub be in bad condition the room be not worth more than any 1 star hotel room my advice never stay in the park Bangalore this propertty make me feel home away frm home dimpee hospitality at reception be very nice and even the oth staff harish etc one n all italian dessert be yummy chef basheer make at his good rebeca service be very good Small hotel small room Friendly staff due to regulation no bar only mini bar with astronoumous price of 600R for a beer Small room wear out bathroom Bathtub not clean Food be good i have a discount by booking com may be why i have the not renovate bathroom but no way a four star feeling Good Reception staff David understand nicely my need room be not compare to Kolkata The Park but housekeeping manage my requirement like hairdryer Iron Box Room ambience be nice music throughout day at lobby and Restaurant staff be very nice specially Karthik who be lovely Young Boy understand well and very professional oth staff also good facility look little old now no more DJ available due to within 500 meter but still you can manage nearby i find this hotel in SPG web site and i expect western style contemporary affordable hotel as one of Design hotel however this hotel actually be not reach standard of Starwood affordable hotel level this be little superior level as Indian local designer hotel for example the disposal slipper be equip but it seem somebody already use and bathtub be equip but hot water be not hot sufficiently fitnes machine be not maintain well lubrication may be not enough Hairdryer be not equip hotel staff bring after ask no benefit be offer even i be platinum SPG member the receptionist say that only point would be give however i have dinner at Italian restaurant on ground floor and really satisfy the food and service in addition hotel staff be basically kind and seek to help me voluntary Overall please do not expect as an affordable Starwood hotel but affordable sufficient local Indian design hotel i have be to various place and see the luxury and budget hotel both in US Europe and India have good experience and bad this belong to luxury and good experience especially the service part where all staff be very helpful whether it front desk travel desk housekeeping or restaurant pro 1 Comfortable room and have standard maintain as luxury property around the world 2 Breakfast yes it be one of the good with full service as complementary 3 Staff nice smile staff eag to help 4 Travel desk complimentary pick and drop 5 Good gym not use spa pool etc so no idea on those facility Cons 1 Elevator issue elevator need room card to insert to go to your floor lot of time it do n t not work and nee to go to front desk to get place sometime it annoying they nee to replace this with some smart card reader 2 Check in and checkout policy be too strict on this and have to pay late check in fee which for couple of hour be 50 of room rate which be not see in US priority be it Hyatt or holiday inn or Marriott may be because i be be member there so not charge early check in or late checkout fee on the conclusion this be very good hotel for short or long stay in this busy city Hope this help for future traveler checkout my oth review thank the room be not so big however the comfort offer be at par with expectation the highlight of the stay be service Excellent and in time delivery Breakfast be not to be miss order late night meal and get warm food be what separate the service level the hotel compete for a trendy style and be list in designer guide Good location downtown Nice room the restaurant and bar be adequate but confine because of its downtown location not really enough variety for a long term stay Staff do get confused with make coffee or deliver warm beer depend on the day stay from 21st to 22nd July be give a suit upgrade because of the SPG Platinum statu the bar on the ground floor be closed pro and con Rooms be great Special thank to Felix and team from the front desk ever helpful as usual slightly small room not much of a view from the balcony Great food and hospitality although would have appreciate more variety on the menu thank to Kartick for be a great host at the Monsoon restaurant this be a decent hotel in a very good location bang opposite 1mg Road Lido Mall but my nightmare with the Park Group of hotel continue first it be in Kolkata where i have numerous issue and now in Bangalore i have book a Double Room with Balcony for a night after check out of another hotel in Bangalore i call up the hotel to inform them that i want to check in at about 12 30 1 PM and the person who answer the phone say that would be possible i also receive a call from the hotel ask me what time i would be check in and i tell them but when i reach at about 12 15 my room be not ready i be tired and in no mood to argue or talk so i just sit down and wait and wait and wait finally at almost 2 PM i be finally tell that my room be ready all that could have be avoid by a simple phone call and my time would not have be waste now the positive i have read some of the negative review about the room and be surprised at this price point what more do one expect they have a good variety of english TV channel and a very good gym although it be small than the one in Kolkata the deluxe room be compact and comfortable with a balcony where one can sit down relax and have a smoke the mini fridge be stock and mini bar have vodka whiskey beer etc Bed be comfortable as well the bathroom be slightly cramped but have a health faucet which all room in this hotel do not have as usual the service people be courteous and helpful i will definitely return in addition i would like to add that the Park Hotels usually have great great location in whichever city they be locate i wish they could work on their overall service check in to check out a little more and i m sure that people will flock there in grove for a five star hotel it could do with a little more maintenance the room be fine but some of the furniture be run down and dusty the bathroom fitting nee a change as well Hot water be not available at all time but the staff be wonderful they be very attentive and helpful my room also have a terrace that look on to the mall opposite give you a taste of Bangalore the restaurant offer an excellent breakfast menu also the location of the hotel be very convenient all in all pleasant stay stay here with friend and expect high from the park but little bit disappointed room be bit small and amenity ok pool be small overall its ok stay main advantage be its in the city and MG road would be excellent if the room be bit big the hotel be run down which include furniture in the room etc the room be very clean and a credit to the house keeper Neesha be excellent at her job we stay in the terrace room and have my toddler with us the height of the rail wall out on the terrace be too dangerous to let my daughter play out there she can easily climb onto the railing and fall over the edge the plant on the terrace be also cover in thorn not think out well for family the food we order for room service be amazing especially the pasta we eat this quite a few time because it be so good we ask a man work on the front desk where the close laundromat be and he lie straight to our face and tell us there be one 45 minute drive away because he want us to pay the rip off price at the hotel which charge about 8aud for a shirt to be wash we find 2 laundromat within 2 minute walk we get way too many phone call from different staff and they call very late when the Do not Disturb sign be out ask if you want your room clean or more water etc i have to tell them not to call and in the end i have to unplug all the phone because they do n t stop Location be very good across the road from a shopping centre and around the corner from Big Bazaare supermarket the Park Located Centre of City Nice hotel decent service here but place be just get a bit old with fitting and feature show age a nice paintlift should help Great location and a nice part of the Starwood hotel group Breakfast be basic but okay please do note that the gym be hide in the back it be outside and down a set of staircase the staff from Bell desk Mr Basavaraj and house keep Mr Santosh be extremely cooperativie to the requirement the masseuse at Aura spa be too good have a very comfortable stay the hotel exterior and interior nee to be take care rest its a very good property i stay at the Park for a night the reservation office be behind me ask for a credit card information though i have a confirm reservation and my arrival time be notify to the hotel as i be check in late at 10 pm they call me thrice ask for the card information which i find it weird and annoying the staff be OK Mr Felix at the front desk be supportive Good food for breakfast and great hospitality Overall it be a ok stay the big plu for this hotel be the location but hey there Vivanta and Hyatt in the neighbourhood too the stay at this hotel be just a very average not so unforgettable experience the Lunch Dinner and Breakfast buffet be just mediocre with repeat dessert if you do nt want Tandoori roti and want Tawa Roti tell them way ahead in advance be a foodie i do not forget any yummy food i have sadly i ca nt remember anything that gastronomically please me here i even skip dessert once they have a bar wait they no longer have a bar thank to the Supreme Court ruling i be share the room with a colleague and hence ask for twin bed and head for my conference within the hotel the lady at the reception be kind enough to hold a room with twin bed till evening during my check in and hey the room indeed have twin bed but joint to make a queen ha ha unbelievable right the room be decent with clean bedspread min bar and standard amenity that you expect from such a hotel the bathroom seem to be a bit dated and would score a little low for the aesthetic as i say a very easily forgettable stay Will i stay here again yes if i do remember then how my early stay be we stay at the Park for about a week in early June it be well locate on the corner of MG Road across the road from a modern but small shopping centre that have restaurant an upmarket grocery store and a cafe the hotel itself be very good the room be nice and large and have a balcony it may be worth ask to face away from the pool bar area as this can get quite loud in the evening every night the restaurant be very good and we have meal there at different time of the day Price be generally good but alcolholic beverage quite expensive as i allude to there be a bar club on the ground floor which seem to be popular with local you can enjoy a drink by the pool but again these be quite expensive the service we receive be excellent and everyone be willing to help in any way possible Room service be quick and unsettlingly quick sometimes Complementary water be provide every day and top up on demand all in all we have a good stay and would consider stay there again just want to say that the breakfast in this place be awesome service of kartick be worth mention he be prompt and take care of all guest with a smile just think it be worth mention breakfast spread be also nice Beautiful location tastefully design and well maintain the hotel be bang on the MG Road the staff be very helpful and courteous it be an old property but maintain its charm a lot of thought have go into it and in the proces we have an excellent rendezvou close to the city centre and just off the trinity circle metro station be this small property with reasonably sized room with poster bed Room be well light and clean bed be comfortable and the linen be crisp and fresh toiletry be fairly good Bang opposite the 1mg mall and surround by office and oth hotel it do not offer much view Breakfast and dinner be good and complete value for money Staff be helpful and courteous Pool side room can be noisy due to the late evening party Hotel need to have a pro guest policy and should do some thing about the noise level of the dj the place also need some refurbishment as the floor tile be come loose at few place the downside be few overall a good experience Location be obviously the good advantage 1 mg road mall be opposite to it the good place to stay if you be plan to party I bar entry be free for those stay in hotel and the bar be good for Bollywood lover they have a pool party also Breakfast and dinner be good with varied menu option and 50 discount if u r staying it definitely not a 5 star property room be old bathroom be damage May be it need a revamp and it will be 5 star Decent no frill hotel Service here be great be mainly just let down by the datednes of the hotel itself Breakfast be pretty average but great for the price you be pay for the hotel Gym be well hide at the back of the hotel down a long staircase massage area there but well equip nonetheless Internet also be not solid on and off really Great staff really help to pull this place through they could do with also increase their security procedure a bit more i feel that the security feature be there as a deterrent only and be only actually use just a third of the time i gues the Park Bangalore be the good service provider for their customer in this industry i should quote their Laundry system be excellent as most of our clothe go to their facility for processing from LaundroKart the quality be out match to anybody in the market and i would recommend it to other as well Mr Sanjay the Park Laundry manager have his priority set to give his customer the good of he can hat off to you Sanjay Kartick be really good do his job very well he make me feel at home thank luca i will definately return to this hotel and i will bre my family with me Se passate per bangalore fermatevi pure splendida citt da visitare per chi pu ed andate al the park

trainer 5 Wi Fi speed be good con the room be very very small with zero natural light the bathroom be also very small the room asthetic be odd the tiny LED be not infront of the bed but be diagonally

location be great with mall and shop available at walking distance be centrally locate in Bangalore it easy to move around in the rest of the city me and my husband check in for a six day stay at this

Hotel and get connect to Vinita Sanjay it be a challenge for them as well to remove the stain Sanjay the Laundry Manager call me to take approval before do his R D i permit him within couple of hour

whole incident create a lot of inconvenience and confusion as he have to go out for the cake at odd hour n the night later Roshan come and say that he have just come for shift that time and he have no

food be excellent and be very satisfied with the amenity they have always provide the staff be very helpful and vigilant to the guest s need i sincerely thank everyone at the Park for such a comfortable and memorable stay thankyou i stay here for 3 day the place be locate in the city centre which be great as it give you acces to mall theatre etc list few thing below hope it beneficial for people who will stay here in the near future Housekeeping front office people be very helpful as i be a single lady traveller they help me with all my query the food be delicious little over price 2 club in the hotel be lively and keep you entertain with good crowd i go for a body massage the service be very welcoming room be spacious but need renovation all in all have a pleasant stay and will recommend this hotel the main problem be the extremely loud night club ibar it be absolutely impossible to sleep in the room also the staff be not well train and room nee a remake definitely not an SPG experience i be use to stay at Park Bangalore for the first time and find it to be a premium hotel with very good amenity the only issue be the room be on road side it have a lot of noise from the traffic on the road else i be very comfortable this be far from the good hotel i ve stay in but you know it not bad the room be clean and fairly well appoint the staff be pretty good the pool be n t bad the breakfast be alright the spa be okay for the price the location be pretty okay all in all this hotel be perfectly average and that would be fine in fact it would be more than okay give some of the abomination i ve manage to find in India until about 2130 every night this hotel be a solid three and even it proximity to a fairly loud and major road be forgivable not least because i m not sure where else in Bangalore would n t be near a fairly loud and major road and then it get to the mid evening and the nightclub open there be two brutally loud nightclub within 200 metre of the front door of the hotel one in the hotel itself one in the next hotel up MG road both be loud by any standard anyway the scream at the DJ make it bad not least because it start way too early it go on well into the night and it make it impossible to sleep before the music stop give that it be n t the only hotel in Bangalore with a nightclub attach i gues it something of a city norm maybe it unfair to blame this place but this be the place i stay and the place where i lose sleep because of the music and that what i ll remember not the decent clean room not the fairly nice staff or the reasonably price spa or the alright breakfast just the bloody nightclub i have be stay at Park hotel for a long time they use to be really cool with the design quotient however the hotel have age and look date the shower temperature vary as you be bathe which be rather comical as you can imagine however the small touch like herbal fragrance to apply on your pillow for destres or the lovely toiletry by Kama still give it a uniquenes the food be overpriced and well to book just a room and eat breakfast and meal outside if you get a good deal on line and choose a high floor room it be excellent value for accommodation and not food Food be always average at all park hotel Today i be wait for more than 1 hour for my room they be just tell it not ready Bad Service after come from a hectic flight when we nee rest these people do this from office Reception be bad here i stay on busines at this Hotel a couple of week ago and it be BIG disappointment the whole place have a cold and aloof ambiance about it and except for the odd housekeeping staff i hardly see a smile on the lip of the staff there be no reception on the TV and i be inform that the server be down on day two there be a few channel that be accessible to to p it all there be a wedding party in the hotel premise and there be loud Bollywood music blaring at 9 30 pm i call the reception and be tell that the party would go on till 1 pm i be most annoyed and finally have to tell the reception that i would have to calll the police if the noise do n t stop only then the music be turn down i have travel across India and the world and this be probably my bad hotel experience to cut a long story short AVOID go there in the evening for a couple of drink with friend its definitely one of the well place to hang out in town Good music good food and great company of old school friend love it Would prefer the outdoor seating the indoor can get cramped perfect location perfect hotel and perfect staff we will love to come again and again to Park Bangalore for our busines trip and also recommend oth company to stay and experience the hotel in future i stay in this hotel for 11 night the hotel itself be centrally locate and be only 10 min walk away from Trinity Metro station and right opposite MG mall the room be clean and well equipped but i be not so sure how they can be class as boutique rather than normal hotel standard Breakfast be an excellent spread of European and local dish Staff be friendly and always willing to help the overall standard of the hotel decor be high although there be a few corner that let the overall impression down i hope that the hotel will continue to improve its already high standard pretend to be a 5star but far away from SPG standard with whom they be partner the room be age before the hotel get old nothing be clean and on Friday and Saturday the music of the party will keep you awake the evening buffet have short option only however the service staff be pleasant a frequent traveller around the world i stay at the Park on Feb 14 in room 312 i have stay here earlier but that be several year back i be shock to see the condition of the room just under where u slide the key in the wall be damp with paint peel off due to seepage the shower in the bathroom be very old and clogged which mean only on one setting would it actually shower your body otherwise the water would spray all over the flush in the commode have too little pressure lead to multiple attempt to clean the toilet the wooden tile on the floor be jaded and completely wear out the window nee to be soundproof adequately to prevent the request from a nearby mosque call the faithful to pray from disturb sleep hotel guest as we know they start very early in the morning and that disturb people who be sleep as the sound proofing be non existent all in all i think the hotel need to shut its property for a prop refurbishing of their room and facility and reopen again use to be a beautiful boutique hotel very disappointed this time Do n t go if you do n t have to there be several new property that have clean and well room i be greatly disappointed have say that the staff be excellent and very friendly and helpful Hope this review help fellow traveller Good Location rightly place geographically for the central acces to all reach of the city and above all all the prime of the market be surround with accessible to railway station and shopping area and their facility of cycle bike be an add advantage i m a big fan of the Park at Bangalore and always stay there on my busines visit during my last stay at the hotel i feel that the property be overdue for a renovation but their hospitality always make up for it the staff personally ensure that i have a newly do up room for my stay Big thank you to Mr Kumar Manish Yash at the Monsoon Cafe and your entire staff Hope to see you soon Good location and amazing service provide by the hotel the room be small but keep very clean and neat Salauddin boy take good care of my need at keep everything in place the bar be the most talk about place and the variety of drink serve be awesome i have my client in the hotel and they be take great care the Park Hotel Bengalore be good and centrally locate Nearby shopping mall and oth place short distance from hotel room be OK and service good Buffet be good variety Mr Basavaraj be very helpful Great location spoil by very very average service 1 get upgrade to a well room but the toilet seat and the basin be place so close pic attach that no one could sit comfortably 2 the room be very cramped the bed keep in the middle of the room with the table attach to the bed pic attach no great space to move around even for a singly person 3 order amritsari fish in room dining get it with salt put twice get replacement but get another plate with the same amount of salt put in even get the hotel person who be deliver in the room taste the second plate who too confirm the double salt in the food Agitated cancel the meal only totally avoidable i ve stay at this hotel twice in the past the good part about this hotel be the location very central in Bangalore and commute to major place be easy from here the staff be courteous and very professional as my trip be mostly unplanned i get an excellent last minute rate from NightStay App the hotel be excellent for the price i pay however i have two very minor issue i think the minibar can be stock well so that i do n t have to order everytime from room service secondly the room be a bit small but neat and clean for the last minute price i pay it be a decent deal but could have be well as a club member be disappoint Room smell like food cook near by Loud noise of a generator in the background all the time only good thing in this hotel be Mr B Raj the bell boy who try his good to promote the hotel you can see he care about his job and the hotel this hotel be like my 2nd home whenever i m in Bangalore which be very frequent it a nice cosy boutique hotel bang in the center of the city nearby there be Trinity metro station and opp there be 1 MG Mall the location be perfect i prefer to stay here because of the follow thing 1 very close to my regional office 2 in close proximity to all client office 3 we have work out a fabulous corporate deal with the Park 4 the food and restaurant they also have Sheesha till very recently it be ban by Bangalore local authority the breakfast be apt 5 Amazing spa 6 Last but not the least Superb service by Shijo Anthony and his staff the only thing they nee to work on be infrastructure the bathroom and room interior be date and they nee to modernize it immediately overall a fabulous place to stay when in Bangalore Service quality be indeed low room maintenance hospitality staff behaviour Deserve just average rating the room lock broke toilet paper stand come loose electronic door lock keep malfunction due to which we get stick outside the room repeatedly Overcrowding be an issue overall this place just do not live up to its tariff and definitely wo n t meet the expectation of hallowed The Park brand of hotel i book this hotel use one of the major online travel site where it be rate as a five star property it certainly be not a five star nor a four star and be reach to call it a three star why it a pig with lipstick Run down and need major renovation throughout everything be wear break repair stain for example in my room the slider to the balcony have no lock the hole in the door be there but never replace the bathroom while keep clean by the staff have miss grout crack tile and badly stain area the shower fitting be terribly stiff the showerhead faulty the floor throughout the hotel be in need of replacement Cracked and miss paint on the outside balcony wear dented and stain wooden floor in my room one elevator be break most of the time i be there Room furniture be old with chip paint stained and dirty upholstery and the bed with it steel cubical frame be terribly unfashionable and a waste of space i be look forward to sit out by the pool and swim some lap but the pool be filthy dirty with leave float on top and masse of dead leave on the bottom plus there be constant dance music play at most time of the day the pool be simply a decoration for the bar club they run and not intend for relax nor swimming by guest this be a big disappointment the fitnes area be in a dungeon under the pool area down a steep flight of stair with no window and a terrible cramped feeling one have to walk through the active bar club pool area to get there okay now at night the music be blast full away on one side of the property my room be opposite so i do n t get the full effect but you can hear it through the wall not sure if this be a smoking hotel or not but at time i could clearly smell cigarette smoke in the hall and come through the floor into my room not nice the TV do not have international standard new station just Indian station so no CNN International no BBC no French Japanese or oth station this be not up to international standard by any mean and certainly not five star there be some positive but not enough to recommend a stay the staff be helpful and friendly the room clean staff attentive and the hotel do have new linen and towel it like they take a break down old building place some nice amenity inside and call themselves luxury do n t believe it for one second if you see this property at a discount on one of the travel site do n t bite like i do you get what you pay for i have be quite regular to the Park Bangalore when i be in India Hotel indeed require renovation but the cleanlines and dcor be always the good this hotel have a unique way of say good night by place either soak almond or some thing or the oth with health benefit note please be careful while pick up the room as pool face room may disturb your sleep else otherwise i have cherish my stay always at this boutique hotel the park hotel be locate towards the end of m g road the size of the room be comparatively small but very neat the hotel be under renovation when we stay over the food be good and the staff friendly the good thing about the hotel be it location heart of Bangalore to be precise it be at the end of MG road which be a busy street in Bangalore and be close to a lot of place from restaurant to bar to shopping mall etc the hotel per se be fine the room be a little small but clean and tidy the mini bar be hardly stock Food be available 24 7 but be n t that great at least to my taste the AC be old and be n t that powerful all in all a pleasant stay but i think Park have lose the charm that it have may be 5 6 year ago i be a fan of this hotel though a little worn out but the she vibe location and service make up for it the breakfast buffet spread be still lavish and tasty a lovely pool superb night club ensure a complete stay Have be a frequent guest here for a long time Nice trendy colorful room Neat service the night club be awesome and so be the bar the food be above average it do stand out from the rest for be unconventional like the oth Park property in oth citiue stay at this hotel after many year Should have stay elsewhere the hotel look jaded and badly in need of renovation Makeshift fray piece of carpet be throw about randomly in the corridor and the door could do with a fresh coat of paint the room interior too look old and tired the hotel upgrade me to a suite but even that be sad to make thing bad the loud music from their bar penetrate the room and make thing vibrate so could n t sleep till after 1 am complain to the duty manager do n t help not go to stay here again we have book for 3 but we be 4 spontaneously we be accomodate in a beautiful spacious room we be serve breakfast in the room only i would recommend it to all Excellent experience it be locate at M G Road every weekend they food festival Live counter at the Pool Side this Hotel be no different from Park Hotel at Hyderabad i happen to stay at these two hotel at two consecutive night and it be same as the oth one i feel this Hotel Management have decide to just run it as long as they could it be very poorly maintain Hotel right from Hotel Lobby to Rooms Only difference be the Tub provide in the Bath room and it be also a very old type of shower and wall mixer it be work well as it be a old one i accidently turn one tap to pour Hot water in to my ear straight this be the old type of wall mixer Food be good and breakfast restaurant place be so small with few people itself it look overcrowded Location wise it be in the heart of the city as it be locate next to the MG Road in Bangalore however i can not really enjoy the ambient of the hotel when i walk into the lobby i have already sense that this be not an idea hotel for me even though i can look at this from busines travel propsepctive i have request 2 room key and the answer i have receive be that they be run out of the key then i be meet some trouble before i can really get into my room and the same situation while i be try to open my room door later the room be pretty small with limited sound isolation usually the first thing i would like to check be the bathroom and this have be disappoint again on the second day i even nee to face run out of water while i be about to finish my shower the seond thing i do not like be that there be no Ironing the board in the room and i ll nee to make a call to request them fortunately the room seem clean enouh to give me a comfortable stay Breakfast be another disappointed thing here in this hotel i be barely able to find something i would like to eat however this make my breakfast simple on the second day afternoon we have a busines discussion next to the pool the good thing be that there be no charge need but the bad thing be that there be fly around us in summary i have no intention to stay in this hotel again for the next stay i stay for two night and it be a very pleasant and great stay Everything be perfect from the time of arrival to departure Check in be quick room be clean Food be great Service be very prompt and quick Will come back again i only stay one night but i take a very good impression about the hotel the staff be very professional and they contact me by email previously to my arrival to confirm arrival time the food at the restaurant be fine but average the room big and comfortable the in house pub IBar be excellent Good ambience both indoor outdoor Excellent DJ play a mix of Bollywood English number Service be also excellent try Veg snack find them to be good Everything be just about perfect in this hotel have a good welcome at the reception from Priya room and amnetie be always upto the mark in this hotel this time also have the opportunity to have dinner in the hotel absolutely love the food quality presentation etc we be book at the Park for a corporate event for 4 night the hotel and staff be courteous Service wise the

with full Mind the moment you request for something he will get it for you that make our day i really appreciate his presence of mind professionalism and guest management knowledge and human behaviour my rating 4 5 Fantastic hotel and great service the breakfast be delicious and the hotel be very lenient when we have an early start about change the time room be lovely and change every day Rhagul in particular be a fantastic help with anything we need have a wonderful stay at the hotel the staff be friendly especially Raghul who make a wonderful portrait of me since he be an aspire artist it make my stay the room be large modern and clean although i be confused to why they offer a stove but no pot or pan to cook with hi we have stay here in the second week of may for 5 day the location of the hotel be very good and they make us feel very comfortable we have take a Executive Suite Room Number 321 in Golden tulip as have 1 year old kid with us the suite come with a kitchen and it be very neat they have provide all the kitchen item and be very flexible with our many requirement Shout out to all the support staff for make our stay very pleasant and very comfortable and Nijab for make sure to keep our room clean thank i be there for 3 day they nee to add some more item in the restaurant i suppose the housekeeping guy be do their job perfectly Manjil be very helpful and welcome in the reception i would obviously choose this hotel in my next visit can not complain though i do wish they have a choice of Quenn King bed instead of twin i would also be happy if the towel supply look whiter the buffet breakfast specially the south Inida section be quite ordinary considering we be in Karnataka and most like effect by some North Indian chef no filt coffee and finally poor filter coffee supply nonetheless while i be about to wind up a disappointing breakfast the smile SUNNY arrive to coax me to try a fresh hot aloo paratha it be delightful and but for Sunny i would have leave hungry at the buffet they also have a pool very professional decent stay Courteous stuff Nice buffet Stuff want to acknowledge be Mamta reception recommend for those who be look for a stay in e city phase 1 bangalore thank Room be excellent excellent house keep facility good location very prompt response from all the crew Overall nice and pleasant experience very much recommend for traveler come to Bangalore Electronic city Phase 1 it be a hotel in Electronic City but the electronic facility be the poor i have the most terrible time with both the internet as well as television neither i could work nor i could watch TV for entertainment the room decor be at best comparable to an old apartment far too expensive for what they offer stay here only for one night i select this hotel for the proximity to my client and for the cost effective rate i just nee a place to rest after midnight arrival and early morning departure i stay in the Executive Room with huge living area bedroom have a good night sleep albeit only for few hour with only one downside my room be face the road and it can get very noisy especially from the honk i do n t have high expectation and quite pleased with the room cleanlines and the breakfast spread mix continental Indian i have try majority of hotel in E City like Lemon tree Sai Vishram Oterra etc due to my busines meeting somehow this be not upto the mark the staff be OK do nt go that extra mile to make your stay wow Security be lack breakfast be OK do nt have the spread for a buffet lift be small deluxe room be small the hotel need refurbish badly we be this hotel for 4 night almost everything be fine except the swimming pool which be not in a usable condition Gym be pretty ok not much of equipment though room be very specious clean we have stay at Golden Tulip for 3 night 4 day Couple of bad experience leave a bad impression of an otherwise OK stay we have take a suite for the 3 night as we be three people 2 adult 1 child the room be clean enough and the breakfast service be also pretty fine there be two problem the small issue be that the housekeeping staff do not bother to refill the toiletry during our 3 night stay we have to call in for the same on the 3rd night the big issue be the rude security staff and driver the hotel offer valet parking but one night they leave my car in the open and it be cover with bird dropping by morning the excuse be that the driver be not available but nobody in the hotel bother to inform me the good thing would be to not provide valet parking if a consistent service can not be offer i have stay in the Lemon Tree next door multiple time and would definitely go back to Lemon Tree for my next visit i would not recommend Golden Tulip unless you be a busines traveler i say at the Golden Tulip for 8 night and the stay be a delight Nice sized room with balcony kitchen and functional bathroom shower i eat a few time in the restaurant Spotlight Cafe the buffet be lovely with a rich variety of Indian dish to try i also have in room dining on the balcony a couple of time very pleasant the gym have all of the cardio and weight you nee to get a decent workout i didnt try the pool or outside eat by the restaurant but both look invite Staff be lovely especially Molaj who keep surprise me each day with Towel Art he leave on my bed different animal and flower each day the hotel be ideally locate to walk to my company and some lovely authentic restaurant around the corner i would highly recommend you stay we have a chance to see this dynamic girl during the morning

that due to unavailability of room in GTB i d to stay in oth hotel nearer to it and trust me i realise the real difference on Food part i must also share that when in beginning of 2016 quality and qty be not at par but now its be an incremental change in both quality qty from Staff member since its be 3 year now so i ve see and experience them very well and deserve an appreciation start from GM Mr Prakash Mehto Ms Manjula Mr Shitij SHarma Ms Rajbir and duty manager Mr Kanhaia be very well down to earth and always ready to support wether its a day or midnight of course we should also appreciate the people at house keep level like Mr Hafizul other who be very polite and supportive Thank you this be my second stay in Golden Tulip both time on busines trip Few quick USP of this property include very spacious room infact should call them as servuce apartment as have kitchen include Economical on my early busines trip i stay in Lemon Tree which us adjacent to Golden Tulip comparatively Golden Tulip be much cheap be it room price or food Apt location in very heart of electronic city Good food Nice hotel decent room the only drawback i find out with hotel be Food they have a limited buffet breakfast and that food too be not good Ofcourse taste be be subjective but in general appearance and preparation of food be not good Room wall be thin and sound from the neighboring room can be easily hear in your room oth drawback be small size lead s 22 inch place in room they should have atleast 32 inch lead place in room i be write to expres my appreciation for the quality of service offer me the day of my stay at the Hotel Golden Tulip Jun 2018 from day one the hotel service have a great quality both because of its comfortable and appropriate facility as well as service and constant concern for our comfort when people receive bad customer service there always quick to complain but it very rare we hear about great customer service so i feel i need to record this here without fail i m write you to let you know how impressed and gracious with all of Golden Tulip staff Let me list out few because they be do extraordinary service by all mean and should be recognise 1 Ranjith Front Office Manager and his complete team 2 Thirubuvan and his team Muthu Iyyan Raju Maya Washikul and even other in restaurant 3 nee to include your housekeeping staff and even security who be really good in addition to the amazing food service and accommodation your price be quite reasonable it be a good decision i enjoy the peace and quiet i need offer in all the facility of your hotel

ill be back on vacation i hope to get the same quality of service when i return Thank you again for such an outstanding service we have a great time when we visit Golden Tulip hotel in Electronics City Bangalore the facility be very good staff at reception security and housekeeping be excellent Food at breakfast buffet be amazing too the service be decent with friendly staff at the restaurant who make sure my every requirement be fulfil also the housekeeping staff act as per my need receptionist include the Manager help me with my application towards the Flavours Membership well the building do n t seem so attractive from inside and need renovation but what matter be the service and i m content stay at this property as far as the location be concern it be more than an hour way from the airport South of Bangalore and get a cab from the airport would cost around rs1 300 rm1 600 though Uber be cheap the hotel also offer shuttle to the airport it be locate right in the electronic city and the only eatery that be next to it be KFC and it halal for muslim traveller the receptionist be very attentive upon arrival and as mango be in the season we be provide by pure mango juice at arrival Room wise be decent though they do n t provide the ironing facility in the room the housekeeping be always ready to provide you with that on demand at anytime of the day i call at 5 30 a m WiFi in the room be OK though slightly slow at time but it be enough to reply to e mail download attachment for work and surf on youtube the TV however seem a little bit off i could only view one channel Breakfast be serve from 7 00 a m have an o k selection with a choice of juice selection tea and coffee as it be rather far from the city centre the hotel also offer competitive rate for a tour of the city two package of 4 hour and 8 hour and we choose the 8 hour the guide be well verse of the city the service overall be very good and staff be really attentive to your need and query this place be very calm and comfortable my stay be very much comfortable Ground staff be really nice and helpfull Nazim the housekeeping guy make your stay really comfortable and his always smile face and always ready for your help Food be really good and in room dining be also very good the hotel be very good good and clean good room very courteous and help staff and good tasty food Overall a good place add advantage being lot of varied eat joint like KFC be be nearby i would definitely recommend it Room be good but the service be slow you have to call 2 3 time before someone come with what you have ask for Food be OK not very good Location be good though if you have to visit factory in the Electronic city area it be a very pleasant stay at the hotel and the room be really nice and comfortable the service be excellent the staff be courteous and the food be also good over all the experience be very good stay here for 2 night with family the property be pretty good the room allot be suite which be very spacious and lot of shelf for place clothe and stuff come in really handy if you be with a little kid the room be face the pool and hence give a great view from bedroom as well as the sitting room Restaurant area be pretty small and i think this be the reason for very limited selection for breakfast and dinner buffet Breakfast menu could do with some variation another be for improvement be to work on make food tasty it be a pleasant stay at the hotel the service be good and so be the hospitality and food epsecially thank to Mr Hasibul do a great

the same menu every single day the pool be always dirty couldnt even swim for a single day Gopal be helpful at the restaurant stay here for two night at the end of a busines trip Front lobby be shiny and the front desk staff be courteous and helpful however be disappoint with my room very dark the mattres be very hard and there be stain on the sheet on my bed normally i would have raise this immediately but it be midnight by the time we check in and i be beat this hotel have a wonderfully helpful staff from the front desk to the restaurant to housekeeping the room be spacious and comfortable and daily housekeeping always keep the room fresh Laundry service return in just a few hour the breakfast buffet have a good assortment of Indian and continental cuisine i find the bar lack a bit in the beer selection but i ve find that true in much of the surround area walk distance to restaurant bank and supermarket i be a frequent visitor the Golden Tulip have stay here at least a dozen time before Prashant and his team do an excellent job from the welcome back sir greeting at the front desk to the thoughtful newspaper stand at the foyer and at your door every morning to the complimentary wifi corridor energy save motion sensor the shoe polish machine on each floor or the friendly housekeeping and room service each and every employee seem train to bre a smile to your face oh and do i mention their spick and span and well appoint room each of which be a suite along with a sumptuous buffet breakfast which make me skip lunch i be currently stay here on a work trip and what prompt me to write a second review of Golden Tulip be two recent example of excellence i spot yesterday i request and room service promptly deliver an unusual request i make 6 sachet of salt along with my humble order for soup the salt be to gargle and calm a very sore throat in the act of gargle i notice that their white porcelain cup have a flat handle that be TILTED towards you to help you hold it better and distribute the weight of the fill cup equally on your finger wow what an attention to a very small detail to make the life of the customer that much well Customer service excellence at its very good Needless to say the Golden Tulip be a very popular and highly recommend hotel kudo to the entire team and keep up the good work guy stay here on a busines travel i have stay here before and seem that the hotel need some level of refurbishment while the staff be do well with maintenance etc overall ambience of the hotel and room have go down over the year the room and the dining area havent really scale up one area where i feel there have be most significant change be the buffet breakfast and dinner while the spread be good i do not enjoy most of the food the preparation be not that great maybe the hotel can look at a short menu but focu more on the taste aspect Overall stay be comfortable and the room be huge with a kitchen dining area etc and all electronic appliance Staff be great and very helpful so full mark to that the cab service etc be also prompt WiFi speed be good i just feel the hotel need to work on the food and uplift the overall feel of the property be put up at Golden Tulip mid December as part of short busines trip near to all IT company Good spacious clean room fantastic service from the housekeeping team Front office be very helpful breakfast spread be good Quality of food be fantastic we have evening buffet at 400 buck tax its value for money with great quality only minus be the quality of towel they be very rough probably past their useful life and nee replacement i do frequent Golden Tulip for have dinner with family as i stay near to hotel and have find the food quality and service top notch highlight a bad experience one of my close friend recently have for the management to take note of he have book the party hall by pay r 5000 and have to cancel it because of a death in his family though cancellation be do 1 Week in advance i get to know that hotel be ready to pay only half the booking amount which be 2500 i find this to be very inappropriate and not a great customer service from Golden Tulip and charge 2500 or 50 of booking amount be equivalent to loot for a 1 week prior cancellation this may deter from people like me to think twice before make any booking at Golden Tulip i hope management make a note of this and take necessary corrective action Perfect hotel if on a busines trip for a short period locate in a way at a good place for office near electronic City however talk about city center and airport quite quite far room be clean and decently sized Breakfast spread be pretty amazing i stay at Golden Tulip in November 2017 the interior be old but gold all marbel stone and we ll maintain House keeping watch very good Himanshu be the staff who use to do cleaning of my room shock to see his remembering capability i tell him once to keep few thing at particular place and he do that for next 30day rate 4 5 Room interior be very good minibar item be not too much costly rate 4 5 Food buffet be okay and not many option but the chef Nitin be very cooperative and cooked whatever we demand there staff be also very good i remember only few name Rabish Kamat Rated 3 5 Swimming pool not use but gym be in okay condition rate 2 5 5 i really like stay at golden tulip for a month i feel like i be live with my family here all staff be so cooperative a special thank to Mr Tahir Mr Ranjith who be the good i also get a chance to meet Mr Iqbal and hotel owner Keep go on as a place to sleep while on busines travel it serve the purpose and nothing else the hotel have clearly see well day but the bed be comfortable and the breakfast acceptable except for the one morning where i have to wait 30min for my omelette if you be use to the 4 5 start busines hotel in India then this will seem cheap personally i only sleep there and have breakfast so it be ok but i would not choose it again if i have oth choice Nice one stay at the Golden Tulip Hotel have be a great experience Service be very good room be well clean spacious all guy very supportive Special thank to Mr Ranjith Manager he be very cooperative Special thank to Najim for the service he provide during my stay at golden tulip he really help me get comfortable in the new city and help with the nearby area which help understand the electronic city well Will recommend the stay and all the very good to Golden tulip for an excellent service Service be good Exceptional support from staff especially Mr Ahmed and mis Kaur Front office colleague nee some more training especially as it a hotel with a global chain Overall food be good and stay comfortable Value for money Perfect hotel for a perfect busines trip although could n t enjoy the facility pool spa etc the room be pleasant and quiet Excellent hospitality Kudos to the staff Will certainly recommend it to friend colleague Staff be good locate on a very busy road and very far from the main city almost one and half hour away from airport in non peak hour very neat and clean and room size be good over all good to stay if you have work in that area or in the area of Hosure facility be good the room be a pleasant surprise they be mini suite very clean and well maintain the buffet be n t bad either the service could become more customer centric the place seem to have a gym as well and the area around the hotel be n t bad for a walk either stay here a week for busines trip it locate in heart electronic city which save lot of time from bangalore traffic staff be polite and room service be very good Dinner buffet be good and breakfast be average they be flexible on check in and check out timing overall it be a nice stay the good part it be right in the middle of Electronic City Phase i and the room be overall good however we be very disappointed with the service at the reception desk i will narrate the event as they happen without add adjective or comment at the check in the staff could not locate my reservation on their system i have to open my confirmation e mail and only then they locate the reservation i have book a room with a balcony but i be give a room without balcony there be no staff to carry the luggage up to the room we carry it ourselves at the check out i be charge room tariff that be high than the rate in my confirmation e mail and they take 35 minute to sort this out i have a lunch meeting and a flight to catch but the staff attend to oth customer keep me wait ultimately the difference in the rate be refund in cash but not the tax that be charge on the difference Excellent room which be very clean and neat Location be also gud near to the software company the staff too be friendly and they take care of your need overall a very good experience compare to oth similar hotel in Bangalore very spacious and convenient room with a seating area bed kitchen dining space and study space apart from a decently spacious bathroom very good experience in general with the hotel staff Food in the restaurant at the ground floor be ok and there be quite a few option around as well we have lunch here a few time my family and friend even l like this place the server here be just wonderful and have great memory spotlight cafe buffet spreed be awesome special dessert and starter Nothing Golden about it so call chief engineer call himself shift manager and without take an effort to Understand the problem threaten the guest to call police security guard use language like this be not your property etc etc Hospitality at its worst they be only bother to mint money that too it be easy for them if you choose to take a prepay meal voucher for their buffet meal and visit the place the moment they swipe your voucher code they get the money and guest a fantastic display of their arrogance no one be bother to tell what time the kitchen will close and will simply take away food item at 10 30 PM Nuthan be not aware that in Bangalore you have restaurant who serve night dinner like their next door neighbor Lemon Tree especially from so call chief engineer Nuthan who seem to brand ambassador of poor quality of customer care they can display or from the General Manager Prakash Mathew who choose to speak to only his staff and not the guest as he be off duty hour and be disturb by the call Excellent place to visit if you want you be from service industry and want to train your staffs associate on way to make your brand in famous Recommendation DO not VISIT this PLACE if you want to spend some peaceful time with your friend and family as lot of surprise await you hi i be currently in a hotel and still will be here for 3 more day Cons i be stay in a most EXPENSIVE suite they offer with my family our experience be we have to call at least 3 time for anything we nee e g we ask for towel extra blanket water bottle toilet paper etc all of the call be address with minimum delay of 20 25 minute extremely POOR HOUSEKEEPING service Pros they be good for nonveg food Restaurant be nice Room be comfortable they have nice kitchen in suite and they provide us gas connection complimentary as our baby be with us not a recommend hotel if you expect a service just for a sound sleep have go there for a lunch party Hotel ambience be good thought face difficulty in park our car Food be good balance both vegetarian and non vegetarian starter it but crowd as it just opposite to Wipro it good to be early over there this hotel be give by my company for a 2 week stay in Bengaluru the room provide to me be epic and amazing it have twin bed a kitchen private balcony dining area bathroom obviously TV with sofa and a personal desk to do official work the food here be also nice but it can be improve by a lot extent i do n t get any chance to use th Gym and Indoor pool here we stay as a family twice for one night and we ask for two room in the first first stay the two room be 4 floor apart and the luggage be randomly distribute so we have to move it around then it take 3 trip to the reception desk to get the WiFi work through a cumbersome registration proces in addition the WiFi connection be very slow and the number of device limit to 3 per room and we have 7 in our second stay we be upgrade to two suite that be very large and luxury the WiFi problem still persist the hotel be ok but the personnel be very slow in solve problem for example it take 20 minute to checkout as a corporate customer i have stay at the Golden Tulip 5 time in the last six month each stay and the associated customer experience have be excellent bar the last one more about that later Excellent spick and span studio appt type room with great ambience fast and courteous service robust wifi daily newspaper well appoint linen and toiletry work AC remote and a spacious onsite restaurant serve to make this a great stay for both busines and leisure Room service offer a good set of food choice a tad expensive though a nearby KFC be the only nearby eat place the complimentary breakfast spread be superb it be only on my last visit that one of the front office staff goof up completely with the airport drop however to his credit he get us a quick Ola book at his own cost since the hotel be locate in Electronic City it be a long ride from or to the airport so you nee to factor in at least a couple of hour for the ride else all be good and highly recommend Tulip have always be a brand to relate with think that there would be lot of hassle around but it turn out to be on the oth way Opp to its location name electronic city and quite a calm place inside the hotel too Staff be very courteous and approachable and ever ready to serve you Only thing which i wish be the room size to be well n big Erstwhile food be really palatable but still if u do nt like the stuff KFC be at a stone throwaway distance cheer Keep that up Team Tulip the ambience here be awesome i just fall in love with this place the staff be quiet polite and service be very good it provide all the amenity inside the room its value for money i just face one minor issue here with respect to check in time they delay it by 2 hour state that room be get clean now but they compensate it by extend the check out time i would really like to recommend this place to traveller hi it Rajiv i stay this hotel for 2 day this two day be awesome Bez of food and staff behavior how i forget bez of spa it come more relax and energetic i love two people in this hotel 1 Tenzin frm FO and 2 Ashish frm Spa in spa Ashish explain abt membership for massage but that time i do nt have money but next time defiantly i will take membership i request to all to to stay here and once try massage i ve be associate since last two year and always stay in Golden Tulip due to their gesture food and room Food Quality be really change compare to when i start 2 year back and be also one of the reason for get drag especially fish dish be not repetitive Second reason be the roooooooom which be just to admire Will always recommend to all visit in Janauary 2017 for busines meeting staffs be courteous enough attend each and every guest and room be specious Lobby and restaurant be specious enough well keep water fall in reception area all the good Mr Prakash and team the stay be quiet comfortable the location be pretty good the staff be courteous Loknath at reception be very helpful overall it be a pleasant stay and will be look forward to the next visit i reach pretty late in the evening and be greet with a dimly light hotel and the dim light be a feature across the hotel order room service for a burger only to be treat with one of the bad burger in which the fry be n t even hot the bad be the service during breakfast on both day that i stay the service be extremely slow one would find the manager a guy with an ear ring on one of his ear busy with his smartphone move from one end of the restaurant to the oth and not even bother with what be go on on day one i order toast with egg white omelet the omelet come after two reminder and the toast come after two more reminder on day two i request for fresh Puris which come after 10 12 minute and when i request for 1 more it make me wait for 10 more minute and to top it all the coffee serve be cold yes its real i have dinner on one of the night the buffet spread be good but the food be cold one have to keep remind to get something fresh or warm up as bad case once an item be over on the tray and need replenishment it would take a while to get refill on the buffet Overall a badly manage hotel and i would not recommend anyone to stay here Hospitality of staff be very good room be spacious and nice housekeeping be good i stay for 5 day and enjoy my stay i would recommend hotel to work on food part as there be area for improvement Overall good for short stay i would really appreciate staff in the hotel like mis hina aibira for their hospitality eag to help customer i know this hotel from last three or four year so i can feel the level of the food facility be not get reduce a lot but apart from this i would recommend this hotel for have short stay i really like the hospitality of the Staff in Golden Tulip they value their customer and act to every little request you make with utmost courtesy specially for non local travel on busines trip they make it so pleasant with heir beautiful smile and greeting with complimentary tea and cookie when you get back after a tiring day its a simple thing but matter a lot Hina be an absolute professional with pleasing personality the room provide be really nice and spacious so relax my only suggestion to the Hotel authority be to ensure the AC on for the reception area irrespective of the time i stay there for 2 day and leave the hotel before 9 during which no AC in the reception no it be really stuffy and hot as i have to wait for my taxy for about 10 min oth than that its excellent Golden Tulip be the good place to hangout for party recently i have organise my kid s bday party Trust me it be very well organised Hospitality Ambience be tremendous especially if someone want to organise your party please please please meet Mr Pronab Mukherge he the good person i ever meet infact he the back bone to make my party Success thank a lot Pronab Mukherge for make my event Success very good hotel

awesome experience for our limited 5 night stay the front office and Spotlight Restaurant staff not forget those who lean our room daily and replenished water be superb Will most definitely commend Golden Tulip Bangalore to anyone seek busines and pleasure stay in Elecyrinic City the GM go out of his way to suggest Lalbagh Gardens to view the garden city hide from the city Nice Neat and Large Room this be my second visit in the last 45 day to this property the second visit be purely on the experience i have on first visit and by default on coincidence i be give the same room Room no 210 on the second floor Believe me it be quite LARGE Staff be nice and the service be all good one point it be quite far from the airport it take almost about 2 hour to reach this hotel or go to airport from this hotel traveller tip so plan accordingly the area of improvement the Breakfast buffet can be improve as the spread be not up to the mark the staff at the breakfast area be a disappointment as in all my 4 day never have a pleasant experience during the breakfast time the service be too slow and you have to tell or remind about your order 2 3 time when on busines tour do check in if you want to enjoy clean room courteous staff and prompt service but that be until you enter their restaurant especially after 9 AM they offer buffet system where you shall see mostly empty serving container empty juice flask miss curry bowl use cutlery on the READY table miss fork spoon very chaotic and slow service all of which be sure shoot recipe for turn your mood off at the start of the day itself which be unacceptable but yes the food be tasty if you get it that be that be the only reason why i be rate them as 3 it be a wonderful stay in Taj MG Road the newly renovate room be absolutely fantastic the Taj hospitality be undoubtedly the good the entire team at Taj be very courteous they even upgrade us to a suite after our wedding we thank the entire team at Taj MG Road for the wonderful

far the good and easy acces to shopping etc Staffs in particular rate extremely friendly and guest focusse at all time Evenrthing in this hotel except the Spa setting be a bit of a major disappointment and i caution guest about it and do not be take for a shock see lot many common unhygienic fly and mosquito fly all over inside the saloon come from a hotel of such repute you will also feel extremely frustrated due to no wifi and severe wifi disruption inside the saloon spa the wet area too be too outdated and not to the standard of its image and positioning in statu while its treatment and service be one of the good in town give you some great experienced hand Fabulous experience i have here they never disappoint us till now wow what a wonderful time i have there i

morning at check out how i be feel as well the room i get be not great it be on the third floor and have another building right in front of the window but since i be in the room for less than 12 hour i do not mind it and also do not raise it to any of the staff the room and 24 hour cafe have be refurbish tastefully the upgrade to the room be tastefully do the Chinese restaurant continue to consistently serve high quality food Great place for busines dinner Its a case of delicious old wine in a shine new bottle stay at Taj M G Road no longer a Vivanta for the first time after the

Housekeeping service be of international standard at first i rate this among the good hotel in which i have stay in India the room be nice the bed and bedding be superb the food be first rate and the staff be kind and efficient the whole experience however be badly mar by very LOUD music play at the pool for party until one AM Friday night Saturday night and Sunday afternoon in the latt case it be heavy metal loud enough to make various item vibrate in my room fixture which add to the buzz they may make money on private party but they will lose my booking in the future overall it be sad to see a lot of classic hotel hard work go down the drain chase incremental party revenue have a chance to visit the re brand Cafe Mosaic now call the Trinity Square after almost 15 18 year the Taj MG Road take up the re modelling of Cafe Mosaic the restaurant be close for almost a year we be one of the most frequent visitor to this coffee shop which serve multi cuisine throughout the day have a lavish

warning to oth people plan on have a lunch there a nice hotel with awesome staff to make you feel at home Excellent location to the airport plus city centre lot of varitie of food available in the hotel and you can choose from several different cuisine the location in the centre of Bangalore make it very easy to reach any place in the cantonment area the staff be super helpful and caring treat

nothing special Staff at this hotel provide the good level of service ive receive at any hotel Special thank to Sowmya at the front desk for be so lovely and helpful Only comment would be that the pool isnt the most welcoming if you plan to lounge around for some sun maybe give that its a city hotel with a lot of corporate client this isnt surprising as all guest be sit around the pool fully dress and have a drink snack i wasnt too comfortable get in for a swim also i notice that there be some small rubbish plastic bit in the pool and no one i ask seem to know where i could get towel i be later tell by the front desk thank again Sowmya that i need to go through the spa would have be helpful if the staff at the restaurant right next to the pool know that the menu of dinner item at Trinity be very less but most of them be pretty good Sultan Vadivelu Thurupati serve us well take care Most of time we do not have cutlery the guy see roam around be n t bother to fill up spoon fork etc when we need them Starter section have good variety Main course be minimalistic dessert to some extent have variety Rest all be good if ever i be addictive to a hotel it would be the Taj MG road

differentiate the hotel be the kindnes empathy and friendlines that the staff exude it be not the kind of behaviour that be teach it be as though the people who work at the Taj be just like that by nature the second thing that strike you be the willingnes of the hotel to put you at the centre of everything not everything the hotel stand for not everything that the company have spend money one but what important to the guest right from make adjustment to the room furniture to the chef visit your room to rustle up a more homely meal the Taj place the guest at the centre of what they do finally all the usual thing you expect from a fine hotel be there in abundance the Taj on MG Road be position as a busines hotel but for me and my family it be like come home Timely airport transfer be a brilliant start to a great 2 night stay at this hotel a warm reception greet us the room be lovely and have a view of the city without the noise of traffic Everything in the room be up to spec and the staff wherever one go be friendly and smile and willing to assist the food and service be very good the breakfast buffet be lavish and the Chinese Restaurant be fabulous we do not spend time at the swimming pool or the Ice Lounge but it be a very popular entertainment venue in the city it be a five star so you know what to expect in term of luxury but try out the service standard it be simply unmatched they will go above and beyond your expectation Do n t take my word go try for yourself while the hotel be undergo renovation the new room be really good and tastefully decorate as

to the fact that the printer be not work every instance be very unlike the Taj Hospitality experience that one be use to to add to it i slip in the loo due to a slippery marble flooring where the housekeeping staff have not even bother to place Foot towel mat it take 2 escalation to have hot water run thru the rain shower despite be a business hotel they seem to have dispense with Work Desks in their newly refurbish room definitely not a Wah Taj stay the only reason i rate this hotel very good instead of excellent be base on the fact that the renovation be on go once complete i m sure it will be an excellent experience all round currently half the hotel room and lounge bar be under renovation so there no lounge area to grab a drink or have a meeting there be a restaurant the renovated somewhat compact room be beautifully appoint with top of the line furnishing and a massive TV the bed and linen be first clas and in my top five hotel bed of all time the service be excellent from the doorman who be so welcome to the manager who be helpful and considerate i also enjoy the spa with a massage and use the steam room again the service be excellent this be a small spa with only a few treatment room so not a luxury day spa like oth Taj hotel but pleasant all the same the location in only a 15 30 minute traffic dependent as always in India taxi to most of the IT office in the area

the SPA area there be 3 restaurant availble and all of them serve good food and service Pool area be also nice even if a bit to noisy because of the main street that have lot of traffic all time but the acces to the mall be very easy just in adverse of the hotel i have be travel quite a number of time to Bangalore and have stay in the Taj Vivanta M G Road this time i be amazed how attractive and well design the newly renovate room look like very good material have be use and the concept be really great Practical and elegant at the same time besides that the service be always outstanding from the reception desk to the restaurant the bar and the check out procedure Great experience i stay at this property for 2 night this be after almost 18 19 year when i use to stay very frequently back then a lot of thing have change new look new staff new restaurant the good value be its central location give the current day traffic in Bengaluru this aspect be a huge decide factor very friendly staff good Wi Fi a Mall just in front of the hotel all make this a great place to stay overall a nice experience a hotel need to make a great effort to deserve a 1 rating and this hotel do do what it take to deserve the rating this relate to breakfast experience at Cafe Mozaic a couple of day ago upon enter we be offer a table right at the entrance where the airconditioning be the weak even though several table inside be available one fail to understand why the bad seat in the house be offer to early comer the dining area be full of fly and the staff seem to be oblivious to them when a complaint be make they offer to send someone with an electrostatic bat to zap them a sure way to spoil one s appetite if the dining area in public view be so unhygienic one shudder to think how the kitchen area could be on the way out one of the staff member ask how be the breakfast on be tell that it be terrible there be no response oth than oh i be just a trainee here obviously a highly untrained trainee finally when the car be deliver by the valet parking guy it be see that they have change the seat position and also the steering column adjustment why tamper with a guest s car s setting for what could at most be a 100 foot drive to the valet parking area it be sincerely hope that the management desist from post a knee jerk and vacuous response to this if at all they care to respond and instead direct their energy towards clean up their act thank i ve be here a few time in the past but have always feel the place could have be well particularly for a Taj property the room be really old and tired and smell musty but during my last visit which be in the month of May 18 i be really impressed the room have now be refurbish and the new one have a really nice feel and decor and be well stock with towel toiletry and plenty of water my room have a nice view of the lake too the bed be comfortable but think it could be a little more firm the service through out my stay be very impressive and the entire team be friendly courteous and helpful i d definitely look forward to my next stay at this property we stay at this hotel for 5 night the room have be recently refurbish and our room be nice and fresh with wonderful furniture and a great bathroom which open up in to the room the view of MG road be fantastic and i be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound proofing since we hear no road noose what so ever the breakfast be great with an excellent spread of both Indian and continental dish and we especially love the Masala tea make by the wonderful hostes all staff at the restaurant and in fact throughout the hotel be very friendly and always very obliging to our request and need Housekeeping do a great job of both cleaning and turn down of the room with ample amenity and supply always they be also very prompt in deliver anything we ask for the front office and the whole proces of check in and check out be totally hassle free finally i would like to thank all staff for make our stay such a pleasant one Good hotel but poolside party ruin your sleep Indians love loud music and that be OK but not in a hotel of Taj s reputation either they should sound proof their room window or stop accept poolside party Staff be polite Food be good but it be just the dam noise and also mosquito in the room this be a lovely clean hotel the sleeping room be nice and have a balcony i like to take breakfast outside by the pool a relaxing start to the day the restaurant in the hotel be fabulous i be not expect gourmet food and that be what i get stay with Taj be always a pleasure Service Amenities and staff eagernes to help you and provide service be amazing and a differentiator even this be away from our office still preferred taj against the traffic struggle i be upgrade to a well room as complementary right from arrival everything go very smooth it have be one of my most memorable stay in Bangalore definitely i would love to stay here next time as well though undergo a refurb at present the room already complete be the height of luxury superbly well lay out with all mod con spacious and with great connectivity as far as the hotel staff be concern well this be my 6th or 7th stay in as many year and they never fail to surprise me some of the nice most polite and efficient staff be find in the Vivanta by Taj could n t be more helpful in organise drop and collect to where i need to go incl the airport i l be back here again and again thank for another great stay once again the Taj service be amazing from the helpful man on the arrival and departure from car through to Sulthan at breakfast and Sakthitharan in Memories of China they exemplify how high quality the service be Everyone be charming and really helpful however i allow Nazim Sait to persuade me to change to one of their new upgrade room a big mistake as they still nee to do a lot of work to get them up to the normal high Taj standard there need to be almost instant hot water to get any you have to run the tap for a long time which be a huge waste of water in a state that be suffer from a lack of water it also make shower difficult as first you get cold water then lukewarm which be fine until it suddenly without warning turn really hot not easy to cope with plus the useless new horizontal mini bar problem which do not chill properly so why do they replace the previous fridge which be fine anyway they solve that by bring a small fridge after a few day the control for the blind fall off the wall twice in one day the bed be comfortable the breakfast be excellent and the service as top clas as always plus the wifi stay connect for the duration of your stay at the Vivanta by Taj President in Mumbai it be annoying to have to reconnect every day Great place to eat freshly make break fast brunch lunch dinner both Alacarte and buffet Excellent taste and a world clas service Food make to your taste and need Friendly staff and F B director chef take personal care it be a great experience host my wedding at Taj vivanta i would like to specially thank Shefali Praful for take care of the bride groom family really well superb experience when you

to 1mg walk Distance from Brigade Road All Major Banks Markets around Hotel Staff be really Helpful Ready to offer their service right from Check in till every moment you will experience great hospitality of staff there room be get renovate be get a feel of premium Comfortable Stay my wife and i stay three night at the Vivanta by Taj and we we impress with the staff i be on busines but my wife be visit Bangalore for the first time and i very much appreciate that the staff do all they could make make her trip a memorable one this include arrange a very pleasant car tour with a very helpful and protective driver and show her how to visit Commercial Street safely on an Auto Rickshaw we try Yuatcha and Barbecue Nation restaurant nearby and they be fine and indeed we highly recommend them although there be renovation in the hotel during our stay it be not really disruptive we do not have any problem with MG Road noise even though we be on the second floor our room be recently renovate and be very nice although on the small side the slightly unconventional loveseat work desk arrangement be fine for us in the middle of the city this hotel manage to become a calm place amid the madnes that be Bangalore city we have to travel about 15 k to the office we be visit and though it be a short distance the traffic mean it take up to 2 hour the noise be deafen with horn blare constantly it the norm to just keep beep the hotel though in the city be set back a little from the road so you can mostly forget you be there and just enjoy the lovely surrounding of the hotel it clean and the room be spacious though a little tired the hotel be undergo renovation and i understand it be one of the first Tajs if not the first so it understandable that it ready for a makeover the service be superb and they go out of the way to make the stay comfortable the food be lovely and we have no complaint unfortunately we have be book in there by an agency and we do n t know not know the geography or the traffic how long it be go to take us to get to the office we be visit so we only stay there a few day and request a move to another Taj that be quite literally next to the office here again the impeccable Indian hospitality show itself as they make this as easy as possible as it be prepay there have to be some discussion with the agency and the oth hotel so it be n t straightforward but they do their good to make it seamless on the morning of our checkout they ring the oth hotel to let them know we be arrive and ensure we could check into our room immediately highly recommend this hotel and in fact the chain itself you won t be disappoint Stay at Taj group of Hotels be always very comfortable and relaxing and same be the experience here also the staff at reception and restaurant be very hospitable and friendly most importantly the room and the bed be very neat and clean generally most of the hotel mis out on this One draw back in the room washroom be that they should be provision with Health Faucets Indians still be not conversant with the European culture you know what i mean there be an Indoor restaurant as well as a pool side restaurant there be some upgradation work in progres hence a little noise in the pool side restaurant could be feel there option for Chinese food also the breakfast buffet have variety North and South Indian dish option to select from the buffet include fresh juice tea coffee etc Try the special Idli which they serve by prepare it in a matka in breakfast its really awesome overall a nice place as it be maintain very well it be one of the good hotel for busines and leisure traveller i have recently stay i look forward to stay there once again Thanks for the comfortable stay to the entire team and especially restaurant staff to take good care and be so hospitable half of the place be under construction no sign board find a gym be a difficult job how can sauna and gym be at different floor i be there for three day all three day steam be not work quality of the room and size of the washroom very small there be 2 lift and most of the time one be only work very less working hr for s pool this time i stay for a night in a newly renovate room on the 5th floor Excellent smooth checkin nice spacious clean room with all the amenity include a broad table with enough inspiration to write a story give the service level have always be a notch high than oth hotel the quality of the new room will make some of us busines visitor come back again i even have somebody come in a check if i need refill in the room for tea coffee bag water bottle etc the next day when i be in a rush to leave the reception staff arrange a breakfast box in 2 min which save me from my breakfast hunger pang Wonderful

they treat all of their guest the room be clean and well appoint the restaurant be beautfullly decorate and all of our meal be absolutely delicious in particular we want to personally thank Nazim Sait the front office manager and the staff who go beyond the call of duty to make our stay so enjoyable and memorable we ve travel extensively and have to say Taj Vivanta Bangalore definitely stand out for its high level of service and hospitality we look forward to stay here on our next visit to Bangalore i book a room on 25th January for 26th stay directly with Taj Hotels when i reach on 26th afternoon and give my confirmation slip at reception i be shock to find that by mistake i have put the date of 25th for my stay Rakesh at reception desk understand my problem and assure me that he would speak to his high officer and get back to me as promise within 2 hour i get a call from him inform me that they would charge me for only 26th stay thank a lot Taj and Rakesh for your help and cooperation the room on 8th floor be quite good with nice view of city and Ulsoor Lake though the part of hotel be under renovation but we be not trouble at all in the night there be a little noise from M G Rd but i be sure it will be take care of during renovation the service be absolutely top clas as per Taj standard the location of the hotel be excellent close to all happen place Value for money and worth stay this be very centrally locate hotel just opposite the 1mg Mall restaurant etc off MG Road Staff be very polite and helpful what be disappointing be the AC in our room do n t work cool and we could n t sleep well as a result this be not expect from a Taj property inform the staff on checkout but they do n t seem to care much we stay for three night in early January i have travel quite a bit and i would say that the service i receive here would be some of the good i have have we be greet on arrival with a welcome drink and blessing Check in proces be fast and friendly Ishmael the day duty manager welcome us and every evening he would leave a note for us ask how our day have be Breakfast be a mixture of Indian European and American they have a chef that will make a Masala Dosa a must have he will also do egg as well Pramesh and a Joy be very helpful in the dining room there be three restaurant to choose from for dinner there be one serve Chinese one serve Italian and the one we spend all our time at be the main one which have a choice of western or Indian food on Friday night they have a seafood buffet during the day we use the hotel car and driver for sightseeing ask to Babu he be very helpful and more than happy to make stop the only drawback be the swimming pool it be not very private everyone in the dining room can watch you but oth than that the pool look invite there be renovation work go on at the moment but we be never disturb by it in regard to room we be face MG road so there be traffic noise but we could still sleep the room be well appoint with international charge plug the bathroom be small but well equip with a shower only i would definitely recommend stay here if want to experience Taj service at its good they really make us feel very welcome and that really help to make our experience of Bangalore a happy one hi i stay in this property during December but review in jan better late than never come to the stay would tell be a decent stay room be ok pretty old property but locate in the prime place good acces to metro shop in mg mall but the good attraction of this hotel be breakfast now there come the brand Vivanta by Taj omg the bfast be literally a feast they have such an elaborate menu they have momo Bangalore delicacy ramaserry idli north Indian paratha continental an array of juice and milkshake and the decadent dessert yes dessert in breakfast most of the star hotel do have a couple of English kinda dessert like muffin danish waffle and pancake though they serve these also and additionally fig halwa jamun rasmalai be place yes u read it right the fig halwa be a die for could eat all day long a good experience on the whole i have stay several time over the last few year at this hotel and what get me to come back here often be their service efficient and warm their room be well appoint and i like that all of them have balcony small but ensure that you do n t have a feeling of be box in ideally ask for odd numbered room on the high floor for view of the Ulsoor Lake the hotel be locate very centrally and not too far away from the high street of MG Road and Brigade Road while that would mean that you would have a lot of eat out option i would recommend that you try their Italian restaurant while stay here they have a good selection of wine and have some excellent hand make pasta on their menu their buffet breakfast cover a wide range to suit a variety of taste and be definitely a good way to start your day Room service be quick and i have never have to wait for more than 15 20 min for my order to be deliver and i have be quite satisfied with their laundry service as well they be currently undergo a renovation in part of the hotel but i have not really encounter any disturbance from the work underway be wait to see what change they would have make once the work be complete on my next few trip this be my 2nd stay at a Taj Group of Hotels property Pros the pickup service by the airport representative be excellent the buffet breakfast and dinner be lavish Room be spacious Cons the receptionist himself take the guest to their respective room due to this the front desk be sometimes empty with no receptionist this happen when my parent arrive at the hotel and thus they have to wait for some time this should not happen the people at the front desk and those accompany guest to their room should be different like Taj Bengal Kolkata one of the basic facility which be miss in the bathroom be a toilet hand jet spray stay here for 5 night in August during a busines trip very nice hotel they do tell me it be undergo some refurbishment but move me away from it to be hon i didnt hear any noise the room be a little dated so make sense on why they be refurbish however they be very clean and very suitable restaurant be very good as be service Gym be decent too Would stay here again if i be back in Bangalore extremely comfortable hotel in the heart of the city Excellent hospitality and equally good food the spread both at breakfast and lunch be too good all the hotel staff member be go out of their way to ensure we enjoy every moment of our stay with them very comfortable room with excellent house keeping and all this when the hotel be undergo renovation extremely difficult to name any one or two individual for their outstanding politenes and hospitality but just to name a few our special thank to Shrish Rakesh Varun Vijay all of the front desk Ningaraju the Concierge Supervisor who be very courtious helpful and a pleasnt person and ofcourse our very own Manju Nath the House keep person who take good care of our room now every time i be in Bangalore it will be VIVANTA by TAJ wher we be go to be stay my experience with Taj be very

help that i approach her with and she make sure that everything be perfect as she have promise us i thank her and the team of Taj for everything and especially the chief chef Siddharth for the wonderful food i attend a conference there which start early so i first have a great breakfast then move on to the conference room Nothing out of the ordinary youd think but the hotel be be renovate

be locate right in the center of Bangalore so all the amenity be nearby but unfortunately the traffic be very heavy as it be in any part of the city so we hire an auto courtesy the pleasant valet at

the traffic make them far Staff be helpful and courteous Food be awesome so be the price Property be not of 5 star level but well than a 4 star Less space for parking even if you want to be drop by a Taxi you would have to wait for 5 minute to get your way clear so its well to get down at the main gate than to in front of reception we stay here for a night to celebrate my wife s birthday it be locate just off MG Road opposite the 1 MG Mall Check in proces be smooth and efficient the room be nice and comfortable room service be excellent we have eat at the hotel s restaurant before and they be all good Perfect for a short staycation we would definitely be go back it be with great pain to report that we have stay in this property in connection with a wedding reception on 11 june in Trinity Banquet we have book through Booking com and it appear book dine through agent will not offer much space for management as high as Director Sales to consider very simple request there be perceptible difference in service between TATA manage property and Oberoi manage property our experience with Oberoi be impeccable while too leadership at Taj Group be peevish enough to consider simple request of guest even at the cost of lose them one for good Hiw le the Tata name sell unless the mindset be change i be a disturbed guest i stay at the hotel twice in May 2017 the hotel be centrally locate in MG Road the hotel have good room and excellent service right from the door man to front desk to housekeeping all staff be really good and you feel at home at this property this hotel prove that hospitality at Taj be all about people to people busines and which make me return to this property the Taj Vivanta be centrally locate on MG Road and be a great place for a leisure and busines traveller buzz lobby and ambience and the service be top clas Excellent staff and a really good breakfast make it the ideal start to a holiday or busines trip Breakfast be great with a massive spread and their chicken sandwich be delicious definitely a hotel i would stay in again i be on a busines trip the service availability of Wi Fi office table for my laptop good food and staff

upto its upp upscale segment i have stay here more than a couple of time now and the Hospitality cleanlines and the quality of the service have always be top clas Will recommend this hotel to all my friend this be a lovely property right in the middle of the city the place offer great Colonial architecture and comfortable stay the food be great the room be opulent and the overall ambience be of top quality Be it personal trip or busines visit it offer convenience with luxury Ancient look and feel to the hotel if you look at a modern chic hotel then surely its not need to rework on the overall ambience of the hotel include the room if you pay a bomb by stay at MG Road then you nee a the quality and value of the money be spend if you be visit bangalore stay in taj be must it give a sepcial feel when you stay there and the gesture and service you get be minf boloowing i just wish the rate will be little cheap for all type of guest the hotel be situate bang in the middle of town yet you be not trouble by the noise of traffic Vintage in a sense and some of the stuff may look a little old very clean linen excellent customer service excellent buffet breakfast and overall hygiene be very good this be a great place to stay whether on busines or with family and friend Good hotel very centrally locate but breathe the poisonous fume from the traffic jam almost throughout the day from 8 am to 8 pm the room be old and the facility be just about work the food be the most positive part follow by the staff service which sometimes one feel that they have be give direction to go overboard because of the facility which be now get run down bang in the center of the city be a big plu there be something special about the staff at this hotel i ve stay at various Vivanta and Taj property but nothing beat the warmth and hospitality at Vivanta MG Road in Bangalore i just feel so welcome and look after although an old hotel the Vivanta by Taj be an amazing experience with top notch service and some of the good food i ve ever have at Graze i want for nothing and could always find a happy face to help the only issue be the electrical outlet in the room be not fully reliable i think this come from the age of the hotel extremely well manage hotel responsive to suggestion to improve service Lovely pool and excellent breakfast Restaurant be excellent and the staff store my bag when i have to go away for a few day idealy situate with well trained and efficient staff and an accute sense of human relationship this luxury hotel will meet requirement of busines man as hiliday trip all service be provide on an efficient and proportionate way Swiming pool be the the cherry on the cake after long day work or shopping Overall excellent experience True to Taj standard room be spacious clean and perfect Service quality and politenes of team be consistent and noteworthy Quality of food breakfast be very good overall it s value for money this be a hotel to be experience i stay here for 5 day and the service be superior right through Genuine caring thoughtfulnes and consideration be the hallmark of the wonderful staff at this hotel the room and dining experience do not disappoint either i recommend this hotel highly whether you re travel for busines or pleasure it family friendly and if you re a single female exec traveller this be definitely the safe and most comfortable place in Bangalore Fantastic location too i d give this property 10 star if i could the hotel date back to history in term of their current location this have be my choice hotel in Bangalore for their great hospitality and the people not just the hotel brand they have the fine restaurant Graze that serve European and Memories of China that have last for so long unlike other that open and close in recent time there be a mall right in front of the hotel and surround area at mg road be a must walk to enjoy the good old Bangalore Hotel be locate aptly on MG road easily walk to MG road and do shopping or have food Staff be good and polite but sometimes overlook exact question and try to answer their own May be overwork facility be fine but due to location it be overpriced this must be one of the friendly hotel i ve stay in it by no mean a luxury hotel but nothing beat friendly and helpful staff the fact that the room have balcony you can step into or let fresh air come into your room be another major bonu not many high end hotel offer this luxury the gym be well equipped and the swimming pool be of a nice size and very refreshing what stand out from my visit be the friendlines and willingnes to help from the staff the concierge be extremely helpful in organize a cab when need and very friendly to chat too as well make sure all my need would be take care off the hotel be situate in a very central and good location with lot of shopping eating and oth facility around which be extremely helpful in the evening even though it be about 40 minute car ride from my office i would recommend it i feel this be the old property own by taj group room and lobby be nice every room have a balcony and you can either have a pool view or city view Pool be little small but ambience be good Saturdays if you be lucky there may be open pool party with real cosmopolitan crowd Breakfast service be good Quite average hotel and not worth the rate be charge the mattress be old and sagging the room have a strange smell the bathroom be just appalling Water do not flow out properly create a huge puddle that go right into the room the hand shower in the bath be 1 5 foot from the ground very noisy water sewer drainage noise come from adjacent room and toilet all through the night Poor sleep quality the swimming pool have a very cumbersome change room for which one have to go in a very circuitous route avoid all obstacle also the pool do n t have much privacy all in all not a experience one would expect from the Taj group with the sweet member of staff who take time for your every need truly a great stay Great room and amenity delicious food and one of the good place for a busines trip Would recommend Taj to anyone on international busines purpose the room be of good standard and cleanlines the service be exceptional and the reason i keep return it be nice to have a team that know you by name when you arrive and really make the place a home away form home when here on Business Breakfast option be very extensive and elaborate Attentive staff with great service the staff at the restaurant as well as the Concierge be very friendly and helpful Hotel location be good enjoy the hotel ambience and all the little detail in the room truly amazed by the toiletry and i be so in love with the sweet sugar crystal soap bar the room smell

can be a challenge we use the spa service twice on the first day the massage be not extraordinary but on the second day i be lucky to get a great foot massage from Libya all in all a good experience hi i stay there for 10 day and it be a very fantastic experience the Staff be very supportive right from dining area to housekeeping and front desk the food be very tasty it do come with price tag and service be very good Do visit and experience the Tajness overall our stay vivanta by TAJ be pleasant room be not too big not too small decent enough there be no bathtub in the washroom Service be quick and excellent they have a poolside restaurant where you can enjoy your dinner Buffet breakfast have all sort of English south Indian a little north Indian breakfast the staff be courteous it TAJ hotel chain but somehow i do not really get the feel that why 4 point Startegic location and good food anyhow service have to be improve Staff be just to busy to answer the guest miss the smile and nee more sincerely friendly greeting anyway its a good hotel and keep it up Would love to give this hotel 10 out of ten but for two reason 1 road face road be not properly acoustic and bathroom be too small Rest all be top Notch Staff be warm and friendly room be big and Cozy Food be Excellent accord to Hotel GM hotel will soon go under renovation and rectify the above two problem till then do stay there but avoid road face room and do n t forget to visit there Pub a happen place in hotel itself sup but little limitation in food but oth everything perfect for me we enjoy 2 day in Taj Vivanta MG Road Bangalore even staff and room service people behave awfully and even drink water be free and even they will do room delivery within a short span of time the place be date and rundown have have the good of experience in Taj s oth property across the country this one be a total let down the hotel would probably have be a really good one in the 80 or maybe the 90 but no definitely not in this day and age the entire place be badly cry for a makeover the only thing that probably go in its favor be the location and nothing else and well perhaps their housekeeping and concierge staff they be all courteous and helpful my first impression soon after check in be seriously you ve get to be kid me the entire floor and the room smell funny i bring it to the attention of the front desk and they move me to another room but it make no difference again the same weird musty odor look like it a perennial thing and the mattres be pretty ordinary there be a few oth issue too the shower in the room be sad i really wonder where on earth they get those one from the pool area be understaffed good luck find anybody when you nee them the service in Cafe Mozaic their all day dining place be really slow this be say their breakfast spread be good their front desk be totally inefficient and this may perhaps be an understatement my experience be totally bad i pay an advance for my 2 night s stay by cash as i have lose my wallet with all my credit card and debit card in it just the previous day i take their NEFT detail inform them clearly that i would nee the cash back after i make the transfer as i would nee it for my expense well i be short of cash and i can not go to any ATM either again no credit or debit card despite all the above after receive the transfer they decline to give me back whatever i have pay by cash they say they would transfer the money back to my account and seriously how lame be that they even go on to say that they do not have that kind of cash and that be rich well finally after a lot of talk get the cash but ideally i nee n t have send so much time on this on the whole it be a really forgettable experience nothing typically Taj this be the first pet friendly hotel we have visit in India they have two beautiful dog of their own too Jazz Tango Hotel staff be really nice and take care of these fur kid you can play with them and they be very friendly their care taker Vincent love them and take care of them like his own kid the hotel even feed the stray outside and provide drinking water Hospitality at Vivanta be just awesome as it be centrally locate its very easy to communicate across the city the restaurant be quite reasonable and food taste be just like authentic south Indian all in all we love the hotel for its hospitality food spa Jazz Tango my wife and i be travel to Bangalore for a night we choose this hotel because of the central location and because i think you ca n t go wrong with a Taj however the room be very old smelly and dingy luckily we be there for just a night even the bed linen be of bad quality very old and small room not very clean and not very hygienic also even the coffee shop be n t very clean the lobby be nice and the poolside be nice definitely this hotel be n t worth the price the room be of 3 star level one action of a staff enhance the whole brand image but whole staff team be work on same style not even a single staff never forget to greet us or smile upon us very much help tendency food quality and spread be awesome this be my second time stay at the Vivanta by Taj my company s office be close by on MG road so the location can not be beat the staff be all very friendly and quickly remember your face i enjoy start my day with the excellent breakfast buffet they have a great mix of western staple egg bacon cereal etc and south indian specialty like idli and dosa the hotel be well appoint and the staff be ever present friendly and attentive i try 2 of the 3 onsite restaurant and have enjoyable meal at both in the hot weather the pool be a lovely option i do n t use the gym but do check it out it seem well than average for a hotel gym with a good selection of equipment and weight the spa be great i take advantage of a break in my busines schedule to take a massage well worth the money so overall i be pleased with the accomodation service and overall experience i expect to return on my next trip centrally locate Service as usual with Taj be excellent though little small in size room have an airy feel and do n t feel cramped my room have a small balcony overlook the swimming pool View be nice with greenery all around Bathroom again though a tad small in size be n t uncomfortable but the granite top for washbasin look out of place and cheap thankfully that be the only place granite be use Bath area be do in good quality tile and have modern Bath fitting Health faucet be miss though Room be nicely do with good quality material Property be a little old and so be the decor but it manage to exude an old world charm which be relax and make your stay comfortable overall unless you be look for a modern and ub luxurious place to stay Vivanta be a very good option highly recommend this hotel if visit Bangalore Service room and food be all first rate Staff be extremely attentive and go all out to make your stay as pleasurable as possible the property and room be

even though the brand be Vivanta the staff be very courteous and we love the every moment of time spend here only issue i face be that the room be pretty old and the property would nee a renovation pretty soon as for the same amount pay one can get well choice but overall a good stay out there i stay 4 night at a busines trip this a desent area of bangaluru the hotel be of top standard across the street there be a mall and just a walk away you have the Brigade road with its bar and vindele life for once in india the hotel taxi service be not heavily owerpriced See you again soon vivanta MG road good place for busines meeting it in center of the city near to MG road and 5 star hotel the staff be professional and friendly the dinner be so nice for busines meeting they provide free Wi Fi overall very good hotel we stay for four night over Christmas and all in all have a very pleasant stay Check in be smooth and our room be comfortable and have all the facility we need although the bathroom could maybe do with an update as you would expect there be plenty of clothe hang and storage space efficient a c a good flat screen TV with plenty of channel good lighting a safe minibar etc our room associate make sure the room be always spotless very tidy he even lay out our shoe very nicely and provide an interminable supply of water teabag coffee etc a great guy the bed be huge and very comfortable our room be at the front of the hotel so it be impossible to open the window it be just too noisy we arrive on Christmas Eve and be disappointed that the bar be close for a private function we be instead offer a poolside table nice but so cold that we eventually have to flee into the Caf Mozaik coffee shop to spend the rest of the evening unfortunately there be no festive ambiance there it be fairly utilitarian and do nothing to cheer the festive spirit we have buffet breakfast each morning in the same caf the first morning be pandemonium almost a stampede but eventually we manage to get a table the follow day be slightly calm the buffet breakfast itself be very good but not quite as sumptuous as in oth Taj or oth five star hotel in Asia however there be more than enough to keep us happy both Western apart from the cheese maybe and Indian the freshly cook Indian breakfast selection like dosa idli and vada in particular be delicious there be a tiny caf Sugar and Spice in a corner of the lobby and they have a small but delightful selection of cake and pastry plus good coffee i have look forward to use the pool but alas Bangalore be cool than expect the water in the pool be freeze and i be tell be so year round i think it be mean to be a decorative background for poolside dining rather than be fit for swimming what a shame we have to catch a 7 am international flight necessitate a very early departure from the hotel the night before we ask reception to book us a taxi for the morning but be tell it be impossible to prebook a taxi we would have to take our chance in the morning or book a hotel car which we do well at 4 be a lot of oth people be leave Most of them go in normal taxi prearrange the day before we be wait and wait and wait well past our envisage departure time no hotel car at more than double the price of a taxi in sight after umpteen enquiry when i be get seriously worried about miss the flight they finally send a car with a young boy at the wheel who proceed at a snail s pace the slow driver i have ever come across in India everyone else be pass us we be lucky to make our flight sadly not a great ending to our stay Hotel be on a noisy intersection but central and also close to Trinity Metro station Staff be extremely friendly and helpful room be comfortable without be de luxe and you can choose your mattress Food be good both the buffet and the set menu Chinese restaurant be particularly good Bar be dark and noisy but have reasonable choice of drink and you can sit outside by the pool i go to attend a conference at Vivanta Taj M G Road Bangalore recently the conference room be very good the lunch be delicious the coffee be superb the Taj always have a tradition they be maintain it the location be fabulous its right in the heart of the city but still cancel out a lot of hustle bustle of the city life the food here be amazing specially the comp breakfast and the midnight cafe the hotel staff take a bow for their flawless service very polite and well speak as well Will surely opt for this place in my next visit on arrival a very courteous person at the front desk check me through promptly as that be a Saturday he suggest city facing room instead of lake face room to avoid music play through the night i be allot room no 208 this room be face the public road to my annoyance i find that the sound of vehicular traffic with all the blaring horn be just unbearably throughout the night it be as if i be on the road itself i be not exaggerate Needless to say i could hardly sleep that night add to this i have to put up with a very uncomfortable mattres as i could not catch up with my sleep i get ready early than usual and go down to the coffee shop for breakfast i be greet with less than warm idli along with stone cold and hard chicken sausage the beacon too be not even warm i then give up on the breakfast and ask for hot coffee with hot milk on the side i be promptly serve with the coffee after mix the milk and coffee i realise that the milk be full of flake i point this to the one of stewardes and ask her to replace the coffee minus the flake the stewardes return immediately with the same milk jar and coffee when i point out to her that this milk need to be stain she insist that it be do Needless to say i be again serve with coffee full of flake it be just beyond my imagination that a hotel which be part of repute Taj group can not serve me coffee without the flake all that be necessary be to properly strain the milk though the restaurant manager be apologetic i be do read undo with the breakfast in the end it look like i pay for a very bad night sleep and very poor breakfast at one of the Taj group of hotel locate right in the heart of the city and have great hospitality Awesome for both busines and leisure have some great restaurant to try out the room face the lake be just awesome to see the sun rise well the experience be good but i feel could be much well with the brand name Taj Room be okey but not up to the mark Front desk staff be polite and even H K staff be good overall it be a pleasant stay a long way from Whitefield but that s the problem of those who book the room my room be a twin and by Indian standard quite small with no bath its close to the shopping area and the Cricket Stadium but as i be n t go this time be a very long taxi or hotel car ride to work in the really bad traffic very nice comfortable hotel my 2nd stay Nice room and good breakfast Good location for me 10 minute from work place Will stay again Attentive

dosa after come to south the masala be not good i have stay at this hotel many time the personnel be very helpful room be very clean and spacious and the breakfast be like you want it all in all i recommend this hotel for anyone travel to Bangalore while the overall premise be not a large as the neighboring Oberoi the Vivanta by Taj provide world clas service and amenity from a standard King

Room service be amazing and very prompt service the music and crowd at ICE bar be great i highly recommend this hotel i can not fault it the service be the good i have ever experience and the breakfast be unreal the room be very comfortable and the location be very central with a lot of transport option right outside my husband and i stay at this hotel when we be in Bangalore for the cricket it be centrally locate and have a large mall across the road with no trouble to get a tuk tuk as there be always a line outside the hotel the staff be unreal so accommodate and go above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable the breakfast be one of the good i have ever have with a great range of western and Indian option and it be set in a lovely location by the pool i always stay at Vivanta by Taj when i be visit Bangalore Excellent service good location very friendly staff who remember you Different option for food both international and local be good Indian be worth the trip we spend one week in Bangalore book the hotel driver for a 3 hour sightseeing package incl Bangalore Palace Lal Bagh Botanical Garden then use Metro Tuktuk for explore the City on our own and before departure ask the driver to bre us to Bannerghatta National Park the hotel be locate in the heart of Bangalore at a busy main street for busines purpose the location be good but the environment be dirty and noisy that also impact the pool area where it hard to relax however it nice to have the good breakfast or a drink after hour at the pool side the hotel restaurant be quite good as be the drink in the bar so with lot of good will the public area could be rate 4 Room size be ok cleanlines of the room be Indian standard so do n t expect too much the window however have not be clean for long maybe it be consider sun protection the wooden floor in the room could be very nice if in well shape anyway the room be not well than 3 level Size and facility of the bathroom do not deserve well rating than 2 the balcony can not be use because of the traffic noise and Mosquitos during the day construction work be ongoing which make it temporarily impossible to work in the room i would have expect at least some information upfront and apology from the management but there be nothing on weekend guest should be prepare for nightclub noise from bar and pool side i experience very friendly staff as well as this professional type of kindnes i ca n t abide Location of this hotel be very good allow acces to good restaurant pub etc at a stone throw away while i travel for busines this be also ideal for leisure traveller want to explore the City what a way to make you feel welcomed and comfortable even f you stay just a couple of day they get to know you by name know your taste and customize your experience to your liking Amazing experience i have pre arranged airport shuttle collection upon arrival in Bangalore on Sat 18th Feb as i be arrive late and travel for busines at the time of booking i be inform it would cost 3400 rupee when i check out on Tue 21st Feb i settle my bill by debit card and notice that i have be charge 6499 91 rupee for the airport shuttle i query this at the check out desk and be inform that due to an airshow in Bangalore all hotel taxi be more expensive thankfully i have print out the email which show the original cost the concierge call his Duty Manager Mr Varun Vijay who check the email and offer me the choice of reimbursement by cash or direct to my credit card he say payment to my debit card would take a long time so i agree for the reimbursement to be pay to my credit card he take all my card detail a copy of the email which show the original cost and say in a few day it would be reimburse since then i have email Mr Varun Vijay two time it be now 3rd March and i have not be reimburse Mr Vijay have not even respond to my email i be very disappointed by this lack of any sort of customer service which amount to a form of theft in my case i be sorry i do not take the cash option at the time as it now transpire they have little regard for correct their mistake this be a very date property they probably renovate it in 1950 so that s fine but how be TAJ charge premium luxury rate without invest update the hotel Do n t bother to stay here till it be renovate ca nt believe that they be charge the rate they be for this run down property i ve stay in this property several time over the past 2 year my first experience be back in April 2014 until 2016 the warmth of the staff from my first visit until the last one have prompt me to go to oth property with the Taj in Bangalore every time it have surpass our expectation not only be they attentive which be a natural expectation but be very unobtrusive too whilst take the utmost care with the most trivial request Would go back with my family time again budget permitting Staff in this hotel be among the friendly hotel staff i have come across i stay here for busines and yes there be more modern hotel in Bangalore i have stay in as well but this be still my favourite the Chinese restaurant be great and so be the European style restaurant call Graze Choice for breakfast be a bit limited but there always the make to order omelette Gym be well equipped room may nee and update and a bit more soundproofing to cope with the noise of the traffic but still a very nice hotel in the centre of the city the Taj be at the top end of M G Road it approximately 1 hour drive to the airport the hotel lobby be lovely the breakfast option be plenty cater for both east and west taste the room size be decent and the bed be fairly comfortable my room have a small balcony and it be nice to open up view and experience the daily life of Bangalore the bathroom be also a good size this hotel seem ideally suit for busines people i have food in the Chinese restaurant at the hotel which be really nice but quite spicy the issue i experience be the road traffic noise hence nothing to do with the actual hotel Have be a regular at this hotel the service be consistently awesome and the staff be super friendly and helpful they have away to make you feel special and relaxed the breakfast be really good and offer something for everyone include the very health conscious the mall across the street offer some excellent restaurant option welcome ambience in the lobby Good size room with all require amenity Warm and cordial Staff who stretch out to cater to your need Awesome food at Memories of China Will recommend for busines trip this deluxe hotel be nestle in a perfect location in Banaglore and warm hospitality complement the modern comfort and the amenity it offer its strategical location in the heart of the city make it an idle location for both busines and leisure the remarkable part of this hotel over the year and still live up to it be an extravagence of flavour and fine delicacy it offer multiple option to choose from we have stay at this hotel every at least once a year for the last 6 year and they have be consistent on every trip the team work like clock work they be all so nice and courteous to the guest that you almost feel bad about get

i feel this hotel be second home after my london residence Lovely hotel Everything one would expect from a 5 star hotel only downside for us be that the evening meal be very very expensive and no well than most of the oth meal we have during our 3 week in India bad Hotel i ve stay in my life and even more for the price i pay Hotel be NOISY from your room to the pool to the lobby if you can not sleep with noise this be not the hotel for you they have party on weekend and not only you be not able to use the hotel facility as you ll nee to pay but have excruciating sound all the way to the 8th floor Hotel smell like mold cover with incense which obviously be not good the same in the room i find a bug in my food at lunch will definetly not recommend if you nee to stay in this area stay at the Oberoi for the same rate and very quiet the building and amenity be excellent Amazing by its name TAJ the property be so amazing and the service in the hotel be simply amazing that i just love the service provide by the Front desk and the restaurant staff be simply amazing over there would love to visit again very nice hotel at an excellent location my wife and i stay with our baby at this hotel over the weekend the staff be very courteous and the hotel facility be nice Would surely recommend this place Overpriced Hotel only thing to its credit be the reception and housekeeping staff be great Old amenity time for a make over if they want to charge what they charge Can hear traffic noise from the road and the pub noise during weekend which cause some anxiety try to tuck in Excellent hotel well locate to mall and Metro station Great breakfast spread lot of option in breakfast love the fact they have fresh juice esp Beetroot Tulsi wheatgras bittergourd and tend coconut Great service by staff all around excellent facility and superb service very attentive staff Food in the Grase restaurant be a wonderful experience Good central location although in Bangalore it good to stay in the Hotel in the evening especially if you re a single woman hi the location of the hotel be very good right in the middle of the city and where you be not far from anything that the only good part about the hotel the hotel be way too dated and the room be rusty with bad flooring and washroom the hotel be urgent in need of maintenance and refurbishment i feel they be simply milk the brand TAJ and as regular patron of TAJ hotel i feel cheated and disheartened it be just an average old hotel in the middle of the city i believe for the price there be way well option in the city Hope he management will stop fool customer by use Vivanta by TAJ brand on this property Cheers all hotel accross the globe could learn from this hotel the way hospitality be do Text book perfect with a great human touch unforgettable Thank you Lee stay for 3 day and they very quickly set the bar for our 3 week trip to India unfortunately no hotel match Vivanta Taj i experience the good personal care from the Staff and the executive during the stay it be a pleasant experience to enjoy the facility and the highly professional service of the Vivanta by Taj at Bangalore General Manager Mr Manoj Mathew

facility as with the Taj group this hotel be very comfortable and well equiped Staff friendly polite and helpful the room be spacious and have everything you nee although i be in a basic room and i would say that the room be on the point of need refurbish soon overall a comfortable stay the hotel be in a great location in the center of town probably because of that the first room i get be noisy i keep hear traffic throughout the night but the staff be very gracious and give me a new room the next morning they go beyond the call of duty when my lock be break and i couldnt open my suitcase they send a repairman to fix it the new room i get be quiet but it be next to a terrace that have event so i could often get cooking smell and there be some noise in the daytime Breakfast buffet be out of this world Puttu from Kerala delicate vada pongal and Baked yogurt the list be endless and not to mention filt coffee you can eat a lot and then work out at the gym which be unlike any ive see in a hotel not only be there really modern machine from Italy you also get a trainer to offer advice work out while enjoy a pleasant view of a lawn be very comforting like be in my own town the only issue i have be while leave i have ask for a late checkout which they honor i go out of my room hope to get back and pack up but a manager have come in even though i have a Do not Disturb sign and i hadnt even reach the deadline for departure i tell him i need a few minute to close up the room and that i would call the front desk he appear to be helpful but seem strangely pushy or maybe he be clueless and insist on send someone right away for my luggage instead of offer to wait for my call this be typical of many hotel when you arrive the staff be over solicitous but when its time to leave they couldnt care less i have a great New Years deal so the hotel be great value for the money but this fairly serious breach of etiquette may make me rethink this option for my next visit unfortunately i spend a week in this hotel for a busines trip the personal be really attentive and friendly and helpful the different restaurant be really good especially the Graze restaurant the room be clean and service be perfect the staff fall over themselves to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable Nazim front of house manager will take care of your every need the food be amazing especially the Chinese and Graze restaurant the breakfast buffet be second to none an exceptional selection and breakfast sit by the pool a delightful start to the day Pristine facility and room with a shopping centre right across the road and good travel option nearby the location be close to the tourist site of the city too this be an experience not to be miss a great experience as usual from Anand at the lobby to Raja Selva in the restaurant to Nazim the office manager the hospitality be amazing Look forward to come back soon this be my go to place whenever i be in Bangalore Bhupinder i have a very pleasant stay at the Taj Vivanta M G Road the breakfast buffet be superlative so many thing to choose from and the Indian dish be cook to perfection and in their original style the international item be good and the selection of fruit wonderful the staff be obliging and helpful offer me the local south indian coffee which be sup however the room be small in comparison to oth hotel and Vivanta hotel in Sri Lanka but be very comfortable the hotel be in the busines area and be near to most big office the mall in front of the hotel have a very good Fab India store good cotton clothing all in

cool only minus be the room size i book the deluxe delight room but find out later it be the same size of the superior room the only difference be that the form be at a high floor kind of difficult to squeeze in a family of 4 two kid can t book a separate room for them either nice place for couple nd solo traveller for family with small kid not so much a lovely and very comfortable stay very

the Taj Vivanta MG Road Bangalore the good location in the city it be simply bang in the centre opposite shopping mall and restaurant the hotel be very well appoint and be also get its much need restoration and up gradation i have be use the hotel for the past 15 year at least and have never be disappoint i have an outstanding experience at this hotel in Bangalore the staff and service be outstanding and the room be very clean and comfortable if there be anything i need the hotel be quick to get it to me there be also a great health center and i be impressed with the facility the bar restaurant and pool area be also all excellent while do the booking we be ask by the reservation team if we be come for any occasion i inform them it be our anniversary they say they will make sure of some special arrangement Forget about special arrangement even no one bother to WISH while we be check out i will blame Process flaw in the hotel when it come to deliver service Staff be quite courteous i will not recommend his hotel to anyone if you be plan to go for any occasion Standard in the room be not as per 5 star hotel this be my first and last experience with TAJ Bang on MG Road ready acces to city Warm place tastefully do Food be great Spa and oth facility Easy to get out and get to work quickly Most office be around the place and just across to 1mg it be a good stay Good ambience and staff really take care of their guest Will recommend this for stay near to MG road Prefer top floor for well view of lake Food be good they have nice buffet spread on Wednesday with good music i be fairly disappointed with this Taj the price be very steep but neither do the room or service live up to the standard the room be sort of poorly design with a balcony for the sake of it and the bathroom be the bad very badly do in term of the way the space be use their in room menu be bereft of any choice imagine the one thing they lack even dessert option but i will grant that their food be pretty good and delicious they run the hotel very busines like with no real human touch the housekeeping staff could n t even replenish the toiletry properly not even ask for extra just replace what use i also dislike the fact that the staff hang around for tip i always give but their lingering around annoyed the hell out of me the bad experience though be the swimming pool its locate at a place where there be no privacy for the guest staff keep move around and stare along with people eat there you would think they would have the common sense to think of a more relaxing environment since that what people go to the pool for i would not recommend this hotel to anyone its not worth the price or the time unless you run out of option Walk over to the Oberoi next door and you will get the exemplary room and service you nee centrally locate great staff excellent experience room busines centre swiming pool gym all the differet restaurant in the premise the bar all great place to be within the premise must try the pool side brunch with great live music play not worth for money ca nt believe it be Taj the room be terrible so much noise around in the day time the staff be good Breakfast be good over all the hotel be an old property not worth for pay the rate they have i have a great stay at Taj Vivanta acces to the terrace garden for my pet cat turn out to be a blessing the staff be very courteous and helpful and the chef have a special touch in food preparation i do not like the hotel the price be too high compare to the room facility no bathtub in the room Only shower be available no tap water no shaving mirror the restaurant can not cope up when the hotel be run full the breakfast refill be slow Breakfast order not service in time this hotel must have not go without a renovation for at least 20 year Faade and room be date stain on in room carpet and picture frame on wall have mould on them Bed do not fit the bed frame so there be a gap in between where your pillow will fall off in the middle of the night in room balcony be a sorry excuse of a balcony with die plant on the flower bed and too small to put any chair i be face MG road and the traffic noise constant honking Indian style be fairly muted Contrary to what some reviewer be say the window be double glaze so this help cut down the noise to an acceptable level Pool and the surround porch of Roman style pillar be out from the seventy Good if you re into that kind of retro style in room shower cubicle double as a steam room which be a nice feature i enjoy Service be attentive though the staff can be overwhelm during breakfast Hotel transportation to from airport be around us 58 one way 40 min without traffic and 75 mind with however at us 150 per night i would look elsewhere they re play the name Taj too much to their advantage the hotel be at the good place at MG road the room be good and spacious and very well keep the food be also good and tasty the disc be an attraction hard to mis the city view room be the good and a high floor one i ve stay at the before and i like it for its location luxury in the midst of hectic city but most so for the people and staff Tourism and travel will always remain a personal busines despite the brick and mortar machine and tech addition that be need to run and beautify it on Jan 6 i be among the host for a global event for our PIO Chamber of Commerce Industry for Indian Diaspora just before Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in the city we scale the lunch down and up and then the dinner down and up and throw up a lot of change and constraint with literally no notice to the hotel minister Secretaries of Govt dignitary from overseas medium delegate from 50 country pressure be ultimate Vivanta by Taj deliver without haste waste and hassle impeccable with smile clas without compromise do n t even over charge i have to run the next day to Speak at the Pravasi Divas and then run back to parent at Delhi after sorry i usually do n t forget to say Thank you take to write this because you deserve HEARTFELT BIG THANK you you ca n t pin point anything in particular that this hotel do not have but it do not have the feel that someone will get it for the price they pay example room will have everything but it be extreamely small in size for what you pay it have always be a pleasure to stay at the Taj Hotels i expect the same as well however to my surprise this stay be well than my previous one at oth Hotels right from check in to the check out the food serve at the buffet be scrumptious and service beyond my expectation it do seem that the staff and manager especially Nazim be hell bent on make my stay the good i get here on 8th of Jan the staff of the hotel welcome in a traditional way check into the room a well space room with balcony and the breakfast have lot many option all thing from the hotel be very convenient the staff of the hotel be very generous and helpful too like oth Taj this be great quality good service and central location somewhat on expensive side include if you get dinner in one of hotel restaurant Buffet breakfast better than average Room spacious and bathroom stock with ample good quality toiletry i be in a high floor face main road but the ubiquitous car auto horn noise be not bothersome there be a next door mall and a close by metro stop as well we spend a great weekend here with a couple of friend the room be very good though we could nt get room with good view as it be a busy time the service be excellent and the front desk be very helpful and hassle free the club ice and the spa be a very good experience they always make sure we get good service be the guest at the hotel Select room face the pool my experience at the Vivanta by Taj be quite pleasant with personal attention to my need by all of the staff far beyond my expectation and experience elsewhere in the world start with the personal attention receive during check in and end with the same level of personal attention during check out this property and staff provide a wonderful experience for me i be a regular busines traveler have stay in innumerable busines hotel typically Marriott Sheraton Hyatt etc however this be my first stay at a Taj property and i be blow away by the outstanding service nothing be too insignificant all request be meet without delay and literally instantly i be catch an early morning flight and so have n t opt for a breakfast however as i be cehcke out the hotel staff insist that i take a packed breakfast to have on my way to B lore airport amazing stuff guy Nice place to stay in heart of the city Excellent Breakfast allow us late check out on Request really Appreciate Bang opposite 1mg Mall very near to metro station very Good service Nice City View we visit Bangalore along with my wife and kid for a short vacation in the last week of December 2016 we want a comfortable hotel and somewhere in the heart of city to reach the place we be plan after go through a bunch of option we shortlist Vivanta by Taj purely base on review and location we stay here for 3 night it turn out to be a very pleasant stay for my family the staff front desk restaurant and housekeeping be very helpful and have the attitude to help with a smile one of the thing i expect in term of user experience the check in proces be super smooth and we be allot a room on 5th floor face the pool and there be a bit of view from the balcony towards the road outside as well the room be not too big but be perfect for a our family and kid it be clean bed be super cozy bathroom with all essential coffee tea machine fridge and oth standard amenity we be happy with the room and the view one of the honorable mention be buffet breakfast plenty of variety for just about anyone lot of fruit salad non veg select continental south Indian dish dessert and live counter for egg dosa all three day we have hearty breakfast it be much appreciate another huge positive especially if you have thing to do within city be that it be in the heart of the city you can get to most of the location include shopping movie etc within 5 8kms we try room service on one of the night we be just relax and the food be very good with sizable portion and plenty of side we find room service price be competitive compare to restaurant price Try their Biryani if you like non veg we love it Plenty of parking within the hotel premise be available but the parking be open if you be go to leave your car for couple of day like we do i would suggest to let the valet parking clean your car after reach the hotel we only use our car when we check out Plenty of hassle free travel option available from this hotel hotel have cab service Uber Ola available round the clock rick available just outside you take a pick i would also recommend you to visit 1mg mall right opposite to the hotel we have good fun with our 1 year old i would like to thank Mr Nazim one of the hotel manager who ensure our stay be comfortable and we use to get a small note with a dessert when we return to the hotel in the night thank us for our stay so Thank you for look after us i would also thank the lady at the breakfast who be more than supportive to make guest get whatever they need i could n t remember her name though if you be look for a comfortable stay family or busines trip and within city limit this be definitely a hotel worth try i recommend Nice hotel in heart of city on MG Road Nice food well maintain be on heart of city space constraint so compromise on lawn swimming pool and other otherwise no compromise on hospitality be Taj brand Review after a very short stay Great support Professional transfer from airport arrange with very short notice Room be spacious but overlook the street it be noisy Insonorization should be improve 1 no adequate parking available with hotel premise 2 quality of spring mattres be very poor could not get a comfortable sleep 3 room face the MG Main Road and Metro line invite a lot of unwelcoming noise Single glazed window not suitable to make room soundproof 4 not a value for money deal if you be look at New Year celebration terrible food catering service and hospitality arrangement we enjoy an excellent Leisure stay at Taj Vivanta MG Road with our Family even though it be a Business Hotel Best Part be the personal touch and that form a part of all interaction that we have in the Hotel and the Breakfast Buffet be just wow Great place be there recently for my friend birthday party neatly organise Great food Lovely and lively

all the hospitality be awesome we stay at a suite and everything be awesome Staff be professional and do their job well the surprise factor be that if you follow Google Maps you will end up go to some place else than the hotel i be surprised big time to see that glitch in Google map location of their hotel which have be there for year tell the front desk to get it correct so that fellow traveler from airport do not loose their way during the last mile connectivity unfortunately our Uber driver also do not know the location of the hotel which be again a huge surprise we have a short stay at

assistance from Concierge person Chetri Proactive help on booking car save lot of time for me Look forward to visit again i stay at the Shangrila while on a short busines trip i make a reservation that include acces to the Horizon Club strongly recommend after many year i feel i be in a hotel where the staff truly understand the meaning of the word hospitality and really know how to make you feel warm and welcome it start off with the receptionist who understand my concern and help me through a very quick check in proces the lady who bring out my welcome drink also have a genuine smile and wait patiently till i be do sign some of the paper work it be the small thing like this that do make an impression later in the evening i have some time to hit the gym even at the gym i be surprised that the trainer there actually keep an eye on me and point out way i could improve my workout this be never the case else where there have n t be trainer in most hotel gym i ve be to the same awesome experience continue in the Horizon lounge they see me work and help me out with my refreshment etc they do not disturb annoy me by check in every 2 minute but when they do come by it feel like they be genuinely curious if i need something and not for check off a box Special mention to the bartender do n t get his name who spend some time with me to understand what sort of mocktail i typically like and fix me an awesome watermelon cooler even the in room dining staff be really great they even insist on not let me hold open the door for them in the two instance where i have in room dining the server be so full of energy even though it be quite late in the night the checkout experience be a breeze as well come to the next and my favorite topic FOOOD the food here atleast the one i try be DELICIOUS i have evening snack in the Horizon club room service from SSafron and breakfast at the Horizon club the evening snack in the horizon club be awesome the selection be limited but the food taste great they only have a few dessert option but every one of them be amazing the mocktail that the bartender bring out be delicious i have dinner late in the night from Ssafron it be definitely good but not mind blow i order the Mango ice cream which be surprisingly quite bad i almost think it may have turn and be not able to eat more than a couple of spoon lastly breakfast this be the one area where i be leave slightly disappointed i be advise by reception to have breakfast at the Horizon club rather than at te B Cafe however there be hardly any breakfast available in the lounge even a simple dosa need to be make at b cafe and bring up 17 floor the amazing staff do bre it but that should n t have be the case they could improve small thing like how the peanut butter be serve have glass near the juice section ensure the toaster be in well shape keep food warm etc however the lack of any breakfast in the lounge force me to try their croissant and pastry which i rarely do i be so glad i try here though the croissant be so rich and have the perfect texture it be definitely load with calorie so i think i ll just eat half but i could n t stop myself and gobble the entire thing the pastry chef at Horizon be definitely a great catch i do n t get a chance to appreciate him in person but a huge shout out to Mr Manoj who i be tell be the chef responsible for that delicious croissant and pastry lastly the room itself i be on the 17th floor so the view be great the room itself be really spacious and the bathroom be well appoint the linen be very clean and the room overall feel like it be be maintain to the standard of Shangrila a few area where they can improve though the TV size be way too small for a room of that size the bathtub be not clean very well well selection of pillow Towels seem like they ve be use beyond their life the water pressure in the shower be very low please fix this asap Overall i have a great stay at Shangri La it be short but delightful i look forward to visit them again and enjoy their hospitality Keep up the good work Shangri La Bengaluru Excellent hospitality from the whole team Good house keep the team respond in a

be very similar to any oth Shangri La property in the world with great ambience and room dcor the view from Bangalore view room be fabulous but what really set this property apart from other be the service level from the staff as well the various eating option at different restaurant Saffron the Indian cuisine restaurant be my favourite just put an email before your arrival and staff try to accommodate as many request as possible Special mention to Pratima from the Horizon Lounge who always make a point to contact me to check everything have be fine Breakfast service be quite good as well with a huge spread and probably the only hotel i have be to where you get ice cream as well during breakfast ca nt ask for a well start to the day since i stay here quite a lot i have also note a few thing which nee improvement there use to multiple instance of power tripping at night which can disturb sleep over the year it have reduce but i still face it also the management can try to bre in Ipad control in the room which most of the luxury hotel have these day all in all a great hotel true to Shangri la heritage Instagram picture bloggerhotel Great place to relax it be perfect for me because of yash the staff at the club lounge at 17th floor Hell ensure he give his good in serve the guest every hotel need such a staff to ensure the come back of guest have terrible experience deal with Lakshya who take care of event wedding there be no transparency they be arrogant and a bunch of liar they openly say that what they offer on their website as wedding package be not available the experience and the feedback on the quality of the banquet food and service we have be not exactly encouraging but we still decide to foolishly take a chance we have block the date for a wedding reception and suddenly Lakshya start to demand that we book a minimum of 80 room along with the booking for the wedding reception for them to procee when we remind him that it be never a requirement before or discuss before and not mention on their website he say its too bad and this be what his manager Rajan now want decide not to do busines with Shangri La anymore there be well and high rate choice like Taj West End Windsor Manor ITC Gardenia to name a few we dont nee you guy go for a team out which be good buffet with many option overall we love the food and enjoy here with my team all taste be nice with many taste sweet if we go with family then our kid will love it First issue we book an airport transfer on the first day Next day we remind the staff about the pickup we be assure by the reception staff that pick up will arrive at the agree place even before the agree time we stress how important it be for the pick up to be on time and be willing to pay 3x the amount Uber charge for this confidence at 9 pm there be no car in sight we call the hotel at 9 10 and be tell the car will be there in five minute that do n t happen we call again they attempt to connect us with the driver who promptly disconnect the call without utter a single word in the end we have to grab a random taxi to take us to the airport twenty minute after agree time at no point hotel offer any refund or compensation for the trouble instead still tell us to wait even when we be already in a different cab in the end i have to demand a refund so all in they cause a lot of stres but all they ve do be refund the money pay for the transfer not a good way to apologise Issue 2 when check in they say they re lock the deposit on the credit card and it no problem to pay with a different card on checkout on checkout it turn out that it be not a deposit and instead it be a charge to the credit card Issue 3 on check in it appear as if they charge the deposit twice the AMEX application on my phone show two charge two minute apart anden i be tell i have to call the bank myself to resolve it Issue 4 on the website they show the dinner hour at the b cafe restaurant to be from 5 pm if you book a half board stay hope to eat dinner a bit earlier you re out of luck because it turn out that buffet dinner which be include in the half board stay only start at 7 pm also the corridor on floor 10 have a slight unpleasant smell that can be feel immediately when leave the lift Overall please stay somewhere else if you re look for a hassle free 5 experience you wo n t find it here this be the last hotel we stay at during our time in India leave an awful last impression Mr Aji Anurag be very professional and helpful to book our next trip and be think with own head and control every detail this kind of people make travel in India very joyful Shangri La Bangalore be our favourite hotel in this city we never disappoint in this hotel i come for a lunch buffet with friend they have a lot of

locate close to the Bengalore Palace walk by 15 minute nice friendly service team one day we do a daytrip to Mysore mean leave at 6 00 am to avoid the traffic no problem to get some breakfast box for the road on top be the sky deck bar Hype a nice place to chill out with a great view in the night with the wind of India only here be room for improvement the staff be more friendly and cocktail could be well what a hotel truly 5 star the place ooze clas from the lobby restaurant pool area and room all the staff be extremely welcoming and provide assistance immediately whenever request i particularly like the Caprese restaurant on the 18th floor great food and amazing view Would i go back you betcha ca n t wait to return the hotel location be really good the staff have not be train as per the India 5 star standard they be very assertive housekeeping be not up to the mark i be give shaving kit which have the fungal inside and explain to me that since the pack be seal that why we do n t know about it we have abig event there the food supply be pathetic the food be bad breakfast be also not good the food be cold and i would say an average expererience Shangri La be a great hotel to stay in the staff be so welcoming and warm the breakfast buffet have a good spread and be a delight for morning the Gym also have excellent equipment i really like the treadmill there the room be also nice and well light compare to my previous stay in Bengaluru stay in Shangri La be right choice to make all crew be professional and always smile so make me truly welcome Great facility such as breakfast diner sky bar swimming pool spa it would be difficult to choose for the one i ve enjoy the good however i must say pool and spa be extraordinary have high quality so i will mis them for sure it just a bit far from center without any shop in walking distance so nee to take cab but not that difficult by the way fully recommend the Shang experience be always good whichever city you try it in my room have a nice view and the walk in bathroom be a nice concept with a beautiful tub a closet and luggage space the giant TV screen make it interesting to watch movie all night the Chinese restaurant serve great dimsum and since i be at an event i could n t make use of all the facility but the rooftop bar be something i look forward to where to begin the Shangri La be an amazing hotel one of the good i have ever stay at the staff be great very attentive and no request be to great for them my colleague and i move to this hotel midway through a 2 week busines trip where we wish we have book in the beginning the standard room be great very clean with good view and space to work if require it have great WiFi i can only imagine what the Horizon room be like while stay we try the Caprese Shang Palace and the international buffet all be great with Caprese be a particular favourite the buffet be also worth mention as it be like no buffet i have be to before the selection of food be great and the team would handle any request i would thoroughly recommend the Shangri La in Bangalore it great for those on busines but i would also enjoy it as the base for a leisure trip in the city this property be top notch the one issue i have be with some service staff when they would come into the room the whole room would stink however can t generalize their be one Staff member Deepak he be always smile and look fresh he be very clean and extremely courteous he be one guy that stand out amongst the rest of the crew Great food and service at the Shang Palace restaurant on the 9th of March 2018 the food be authentic and the staff lead by the very hand on Srijith be charge up to serve us with enthusiasm a sit down dinner serve without any confusion be a pointer to the wonderful management of this restaurant from the lobster to the hot pot lamb Peking duck and of course the pan fry noodle the food be exemplary Great place to entertain have not stay in that many Shangri La but enough to give my non biased opinion i be a little disappointed with the hotel especially with the check in reception we arrive almost at 11 00 pm at the hotel and be quickly attend to which be great but the staff simply go through the proces to assign me a room without check through the booking confirmation which state for a non smoking king sized bed only when i get my card and ask do i know my request be not grant and it take a while to re proces what do not help be also that he do not offer to share what time do breakfast start and also where it be serve assume we know about it in addition he do not even offer to point to where the lift lead to the room be expect that we know it very well the room be spacious but i see some small flaw such as the workmanship of the room be not up to par with a faulty switch in bathroom Breakfast on the first day be a disaster as most of the dish be not really ready by 6 30 am and that some of the dish be already cold consider that i go slightly after 6 30 am the good thing be that the bad experience end after the breakfast on the first day as thereafter everything be fine from the dinner buffet which we have and we be lucky we go on lobster night as i mention this be not the good Shangri La i be expect and hope they can improve on this another busines meeting and this time in Bangalore this be a large group of over 200 and we have book the Shangri La as the venue of choice i will not mention much about the check in as it be handle by our own dedicated group since we have a large group of people for the conference the room i get be on the 5th floor overlook the swimming pool from the front of the property it be large as be to be expect and very well appoint with multiple complimentary bottle of water i mention this in comparison to a stay i have at another hotel the precede week where water be not as freely provided Adequate toiletry be provide and the furniture be clean and well maintain Only grouse be the stain ironing table which seem out of place in such a clean environment on the first day we have our dinner and drink outside the B caf on the ground floor over the day i notice consistent offering of Lebanese cuisine at breakfast and dinner as well which be a first for me at stay in hotel in India some of our vegetarian guest take offense to the chef make dosa for veg and kheema dosa use the same ladle and ask him to separate them out the roti basket be expect to have an assortment of bread but all of them end up look the same like miniature roti not sure if it be because we be consume them as soon as they be bring in the conferencing facility be top notch and most of the technical setup work as expect the ballroom be a little small for a group of our size but it be well manage the setup for our technical event also be do well the bar setup that evening for our technical setup have staff who could make a few cocktail but be a little unsure of how to deal with the crowd or addres request from our foreign guest twice i end up pick up a glas directly from the counter as they take too long in confer on how to make a particular drink or find stuff Service on the bar and the coffee counter be one grey area here during our break session the coffee be at time sugary and at time without sugar where most of us expect that the standard be to have it serve without sugar allow those who need it to be add then there be time when the coffee run out mid way and they have to make up a fresh batch which do not happen before our break time conclude but this be make up for by the b caf as those who could not get a coffee or tea here just walk down to the caf and pick up a cutting chai in an authentic small glas Breakfast at the b caf be excellent as well with various Lebanese dish at one of the counter due to the placement of the counter be spread apart i miss the Indian one on both day as well as the bread on ask one of the staff he be clueless and take me to 2 oth people before one of them point me in the right direction Lead me to believe these disconnect could be due to some of the staff be new but it do not dilute their attitude or approach to service which be exemplary so in all a good stay and if i have reason to choose Shangri La again yes i would one thing to note be that there be a school or college adjacent on the left side and it can get a little noisy in the morning Great experience at Shangri La hotel i really recommand this hotel during travel in Bangalore People be so kind thank to Murali our doorman for daily take care of me room be clean and facility be great you can enjoy of several restaurant the Spa area the pool and fitnes center it be a great experience very nice place very good property very good service very good staff and manger very nice club lunch very good food at ground floor restaurant very nice house keep person very nice gate keeper and security also nice i go here for lunch the buffet be huge with plenty of option the food be amazing and the staff super friendly i wouldnt know how a buffet could be any well than this Im definitely go back spend 3 night in this Bangalore property what i like the most about this place be the spacious room the room be about 400 Sq Ft for the bed area and add a large bathroom with space for luggage a separate shower area and a bath tub my room be face the east with a beautiful sun rise everyday morning the room have a good amount of supply and brand boutique toiletry the AC take a long time to cool the room in the evening which be the only issue i face during my stay the hotel have a restaurant at the backside and hence there be a good amount of open space around the hotel which i use well for my evening walk in the pleasant climate the breakfast buffet have a variety South Indian North Indian Asian and Continental spread Chat and chai counter do live up to the street food experience the variety of in house fresh juice be amazing i like their grape juice very much the fresh fruit counter also have lot of variety Overall a great place to stay Shangri la service be good the service on the 17th floor be very good the staff be amazing the cleaning be excellent we have a problem with the noise but the manager be willing to move us to a suite i love this hotel the food and people be the good the rooftop bar have the good view and delicious bar food i m not sure where

nice bed very important for my back Restaurant with a broad variety of style plate all well cooked and tasty top service i highly recommend this be my first stay at this Shangri La and i like it very much though the hotel seem a little worn the service and ambience remain top notch and be signature Shangri La my only feedback would be that the dust of Bangalore seem to be creep in and change the carpet or remove them altogether and better filtering of the air would make a big difference to guest especially if they be sensitive to the dust and have respiratory allergy like i do i would definitely stay here again Glad to see this Shangri La also have the home away from home feel to it Amazing ambience very nice view of Bengaluru Excellent and very courteous service under the ever so attentive Ms Kataria and her team Thank you for make it a memorable evening look forward to to more visit the building be beautiful and well keep in communal area Food be tasty and with plenty of variety bed be comfortable and room airy what let down this hotel be the lack of attention to detail for a 5 star hotel i wouldnt expect to find mould in the corner of the shower nor to have to keep remind breakfast staff that i have ask for a drink before oth people who be serve with the same drink nor have to re down for another laundry bag when my clean laundry have just be drop in my room Great for a 4 star also please buy the fish in each room big bowl the poor thing havent get room to swim around Its also worth note that be press repeatedly to the point of be hassle to review the hotel on trip adviser isnt something that i think constitute great service Leave me alone to get on with my day please the Sunday brunch be a grand affair to remember for the whole family the spread be great the Indian defection need improvement especially south Indian food be absent Service be good and attentive Ambience be enjoyable and the restaurant be spread out well the family seater table for 8 be lovely we stay here in February a perfect time of year our suite be impeccable and room service prompt and courteous the towel and sheet be of excellent quality help give the room an overall sense of luxury and comfort the large ground floor dining area too big to call it a room be busy and noisy at time but in the end sufficient to preclude need to find outside dining Location be

Washroom connect to the TV the Staff be great and be very Prompt even Late night when i need some assistance the Breakfast Next Morning be also great and the spread be really well think out Overall e enjoy our Short stay at this Hotel and would recommend this for People look at a Luxury Hotel not too far from all the Shopping or for the Business People Shangrila at Palace road Bengaluru be a nice hotel but it staff at the restaurant be under train and their manager be not suitable for service industry staff easily forget the order openly crib for any special request give poor service not once or twice all the time that we be at the hotel s various restaurant Example breakfast order be forget plate not clear on time coffee not serve fresh etc Example Dinner live grill chef be arrogant serve the food over cooked and dry when complain he say he ca n t help if i do not come to pick up the food on time he repeat the same dry like papad chicken fish etc not again not value for money both me and my friend have a disappointing stay not again this be a luxuriously lovely hotel the bedroom and bathroom be large and extremely comfortable with superb view across the city the dining option be many and varied and all the one i try be first clas the executive lounge be large and relax with cocktail and food option at various time of the day the staff be all welcoming and helpful i have to single out two for exceptional praise Mohan one of the driver be extremely helpful in help me sort out a personal issue which arise during a drive round the city i would n t have manage it without him then Daniela who advise and assist on several oth issue be the personification of efficiency and charm both these exemplary employee be a credit to the company and to themselves so why i have i not award 5 star well there be a small number of negative aspect admittedly not very significant first i be surprised that my Golden Circle membership be not explicitly acknowledge when i check in or check out nor be i offer some of the associated benefit eg welcome amenity and or complimentary facility relate to my membership level second there be no evening turn down service which i find surprising for a hotel of this standard and third a hotel driver not the one mention above keep try to get me to visit outlet and shop despite my say i do n t want to do any shopping i hope this slightly negative feedback be accept in a constructive way because it be much exceed by the overall experience of my stay which remain very positive i check in to the suite room and place my roll er bag on the dresser rack and try to open the drawer the lid of the drawer fall off on my leg and inflict a deep wound the design be so strange that there be no handle to the drawer and only the middle section can be pull out as a drawer the oth 2 section be fix Great hotel with expensive fixture but fail to consider the basic then i call the hotel staff to come with first aid to my surprise they do not have cotton roll in the kit Luxury hotel Veg and non veg food variety be good Taste be okay i would say locate in heart of the city room be big and very nice clean comfortable 19th Floor bar be awesome Banquet hall be big we use the Ballroom banquet hall at Shangri La Bangalore for a 25th anniversary celebration the experience be wonderful under the banquet manager Mr Lakshy we be treat with extreme hospitality and have an extremely satisfying experience i stay at the Shangri La and find it to be a wonderful hotel with a great staff Heena be a very gracious greeter with a smile on her face always and Amit be so helpful in the horizon lounge i have a great stay and they even give me a go away party the staff in the health club be there with new idea and ready to spot me with my workout the outdoor pool be great for lap of just lounge at the 5 restaurant be all top notch the hotel be price at the same level of 4 star hotel in North America but it offer the good 5 star room i ve stay in notice they be not large but they include a lot of luxurious detail that make a big difference the furniture the floor to ceiling window and all the little free item provide in almost every drawer make you feel they think of every detail to make you feel like royalty however all that be eclipse by the outstanding experience the staff deliver from the restaurant where they remember your name and room number the hotel be full to the sup friendly lady in the lobby who entertain you while you wait for your cab overall the perfect place for the demanding traveler who want to experience the next level of luxurious pampering Fab Amazing experience beautiful place Samsheer and Faizal be excellent in service Courteous and friendly staff around Blue lit amazing cocktail and wine the food and the wine be amazing combination my 12 day stay for work and short holiday pair perfectly well at this beautiful property which be centrally locate with every important place with a 5 10mins reach the room and bathroom be spacious very clean and come with 2 main view one of the Bangalore palace and the oth overlook the city view be not really a wow factor but the service and food be excellent at the hotel if you stay here you must try their award win Indian restaurant Saffron the food be simply amazing the hotel have it s own roof top bar which again be the good way to unwind at night do take a cardigan or shawl as it get a little chilly at night the Chi spa too be a must try i try the Royal Thai Herbal Compress and find myself wake up twice snore loud as ever yes its that good Georgie be the masseur at breakfast do try the Indian corner which to me seem the good and do not forget to ask for Filter Coffee it the only thing you nee to kick start the day also do try the Dahi Puri at dinner time at Cafe 5 overall a wonderful stay and the staff be extremely nice and all out to ensure a pleasant stay Large and nice room the deluxe room have spacious bath room with both shower and bath tub dont forget to try the toilet that will spray your bottom instead of you use the usual paper the staff be very friendly and polite when you arrive you can expect at 3 5 people greet you it may take some time to get your tea or coffee at breakfast Security be very good all car be search before they be allow to enter the hotel area before you be allow to enter the lobby you nee to pas through airport security the restaurant be well worth a visit each Great food if you dont want you dont have to search for oth restaurant in Bangalore i stay here for 4 night and can very much recommend the hotel it be resonantly price and room be top quality how ever there be a strange musty smell in my room that would n t go away Staff be pleasant and the food be good and a decent price the Shangri La be in the top 3 4 hotel in Bangalore but for me the JW Marriott be just slightly well a warm welcome prompt help by bell boy Babu and he also give useful information about the hotel and the surrounding i also have great breakfast with an unusual amount of variety also the tea in the lounge area on ground floor be great but a bit pricey maybe clearly upscale if possible book a room at the Horizon Club level floor while expensive there be service such as conference facility all around beverage and club food service include in the room rate that make it a good deal Impressive view what a lovely stay this hotel be so refined around the edge that everything seem flawless to me anyway Check in be fast friendly efficient and accompany by a beverage my room be amazing Spacious with a beautiful panorama view as request i eat at Yataii on my first night i order a set menu which must have consist of 100 course the food be outstanding while present beautifully on each dish the service be friendly attentive and very well informed i also eat a lunch buffet at b Cafe and it do not disappoint as a matter of fact the service be so good that people keep bring me food i say i like so i do n t have to get up and get it at a buffet i be not lazy or self entitle so i notice these thing the spa be lovely as well i have a 2 hour Shirodhara treatment and all i can say be wow the spa staff be n t the friendly but the overall experience be amazing upon checkout i think that the front desk have lose my reservation for a car to the airport which i have organize when i check in they never really tell me what be go on but i could tell something be up the gentleman tell me to sit down and wait the next thing i know i be be sweep into a car and profusely apologize to for make me wait i simply smile at the guy and shake his hand and say there be no need to apologize as he be stick me in the car 2 minute earlier than the time i have request this be probably the nice fine hotel experience i have ever have i will definitely stay here again i enjoy my stay in Shangri La very much the hotel be very modern clean and offer everything one desire a big plu be the friendly staff they be very attentive they always smile and greet and they help with every step the food as well be just fantastic sometimes a bit spicy but that normal for India the guestroom be also great Clean big and comfortable only the internet connection be a bit poor it okay for check mail and surf around a bit but when it come to youtube video it always take quite a bit of preloade time the horizon lounge be also very nice on the 17th floor Great view over the city and very friendly staff serve fine food and beverage i would recommend Shangri La to everyone visit Bangalore there be also a airport shuttle which we take it quite expensive but it work out well i can recommend it although the car be not a very high standard one at least it be spacey and wait for us after our plane be half an hour too late and after we spend 1 hour at the visa control we take a tour of the area local to the Shangri La hotel by the hotel s chauffeur Ali in the hotel car cost 2 100 rupe an excellent way to see the many interesting sight with a safe an very knowledgable driver guide well worth it we have a great 2 night stay at the Shangri La the room be fantastic food be good especially for breakfast and they even have a child s play area in the breakfast restaurant which be a great idea for family with kid however my only complaint be at check in we arrive at the hotel quite late around 1 am with my pregnant wife and a toddler the hotel staff be not at all prepared for our arrival something you would expect from a Shangri La hotel we have to wait for around 10min to follow the standard check in procedure which be quite boring no smile nothing i would have though at such a late hour and consider my wife and son they would have take us directly to the room and process the check in in the room Something the management need to look into stay here for 3 night in July Everything from the staff to the service to the room and food be excellent i ve stay in many hotel but the Shangri La be one of the good the room be HUGE the bathroom be kitte out with everything their breakfast buffet be unbelievable they have EVERYTHING at breakfast Would definitely stay again i have a dinner with my colleague in Saffron as we want to try some India local food Perfect taste and nice people Great service of Pena and Ubay Good place with beautiful sightseeing a wonderful night we spend the stay be very comfortable the staff be courteous and knowledgeable the food be good the breakfast spread in the caf be awesome overall an excellent experience i would love to stay in the Shangri La again Nice property and a pleasant change from the regular one i have be visit Bangalore regularly since nearly 30 year and always preferred staying at the regular establish upscale property but last two time i have stay at Shangri La have be a pleasant change i have stay at this hotel for quite a few time in last one month the staff be friendly but slow the staff at B cafe take their own sweet time before serve request item by the time item reach table its cold in more than 10 visit only once egg white omelette be serve as request Observed couple of time housekeep personal carrying dustbin in one hand and fruit in the oth hand compromising hygiene Management need to look into this seriously and sensitize the staff it a great property and superb location not too far from the happen brigade road and famous Carmel college Awesome and well maintain pool and courteous staff everywhere include reception poolside breakfast room service and house keeping the breakfast spread be worth get on to some kind of great breakfast list stay here for two night and be luckily upgrade to a well room it be absolutely amazing great view bright and spacious comfy bed Fantastic service Pool be great too except you only get sun in the morning until about 12 noon would be good to have a place to lounge in the afternoon with sun Rooftop bar be nice too stay in Shangri la during busines trip and find it outstanding room be very comfortable and spacious Interior design across hotel be beautiful Check in proces be a bit slow but that could vary with timing and rush i think good part be gourmet treat in both restaurant and breakfast Multiple cuisine be available and food be very good in all a very good hotel at very central location have visit shangrilal s restaurant saffron with family for post Diwali dinner such an amazing hospitable experience good food Warm server special mention for me Ashish who go that extra mile to make a it a good one i love this hotel the room be big and beautiful view Friendly staff and delicious breakfast we dine at Yataii one of their restaurant and the food and service be exceptional the hotel do have security and it be easy to get Uber highly recommend this be a great hotel and my new favorite in Bengalaru my pre checkin room request be meet without fus my room be large and beautifully design all of the staff be great and greet guest with a smile whether they be the housekeeping staff or the doorman all in all a great experience Brilliant Stay at the Shang Palace easily the most luxurious presidential suite in the south of India with a superb selection of restaurant in room dining menu s i would gladly stay here a full month i love the hotel the atmosphere be good the highlight be dinner at YaiTaii the Japanese restaurant the food be so good Breakfast in the B Caf be lovely and well lay out to cater for all taste you can eat till you drop do n t manage that though Will definitely keep this on the top of my list for the next trip to Bangalore i stay here 4 day for a busines conference i can recommend this hotel if you can afford it with the travel policy of your company Service be great everything even better than European 5 star standard Staff be one of the most service orient i have ever see Room be good everything very clean only thing to be improve Air conditioning in the conference room be way too cold and could seemingly not be sufficiently regulate be there for a Business Conference stay there for 2 night Everything be comfortable start from the check in proces to the stay at night Breakfast be simply BIG huge spread Service be excellent although at peak time it be understand ca nt say more she be stunningly BEAUTIFUL i have just stay here on Business Good spot for travel to busines park in the north of the city Room be comfortable and choice for eat in the hotel be enough Area if fine for a walk to cafe and some restaurant if not rain ATM around the corner and hotel do currency at a good rate Pleasant staff and impressive view from rooftop bar extremely frustrating that every time i stay in this hotel i always have to call the service center to deliver shower cap the housekeeping be just not up to standard you would not expect it in Shangri La but it happen every time we have an excellent and very enjoyable stay at the Shangri la hotel the room be incredibly spacious bathroom stunningly big and clean Staff be it at reception or the various restaurant or at the b cafe or room service be very friendly polite and helpful especially room service be available 24 hour and fast ever ready and eag to help in every little and possible way Food be of great quality especially the rich breakfast buffet and not the least we be very thankful to the hotel for late check out facility due to a reschedule flight we will definitely be back Excellent place specially the b cafe be outstanding service be there be fantastic Nice place to visit again and again where you can find fantastic and amazing people like Ranju who can make you feel home away home travel back from India to Dulles i want to give my hon review of this hotel let start with the positive the staff be extremely helpful and friendly i never find myself wait for a second and they be extremely attentive and knowledgeable the hotel be centrally locate and be pretty much in the heart of the city and close to a lot of major attraction the room be over sized and have great view of the city everything be impeccably clean and well maintain then the negative i find more often than not the hotel be fixate on the up sell where you may ask for a particular dish or service and then listen to staff try and sell the next level up product this could range from something as simple as a cup of coffee from a regular coffee order to why not try a cappuccino to a restaurant dish a plate recommendation which be always more expensive than my choice it be OK for the first couple of day but then it really start to grind on me and get annoying the hotel have security outside with an X ray machine and security guard but on every occasion i put my bag through the machine i ca n t recall anyone actually look at the screen to analyze the scan i get the distinct impression this be purely for show and actually serve no practical purpose the security guard seem more focused on greet me and ask how i be which of course be very nice though from a security edict i d kinda like them to focu on be a security guard and not a meet and greet person the hotel have no shortage of those people the airport shuttle be non existent when i inquire about this at the front desk i be tell they offer a car service to the hotel for which you have to pay the sky lounge bar i attempt to visit on one occasion but turn around when i hear loud disco music as soon as the elevator door open it better describe as a night club if that your thing then great but i be expect a more lounge bar relaxed type atmosphere not a club one in summary the Shangri La have all the ingredient that should make a great hotel just something be miss Part of that i think be just atmosphere like be in one of the restaurant and club music play in the background oth time its being interrupt in my meal to complete a server survey on a mobile phone it nothing that be earth shatter but the hotel be polish a 5 star badge so ultimately those detail matter my favorite hotel in Bangalore Excellent service that begin with the transfer from the Airport in the middle of the night the room be very comfortable and the view over Bangalore be stunning the food experience be outstanding the B cafe downstairs with the awesome Mighty brunch on Sunday and the excellent breakfast buffet every day a very good Indian restaurant and one of the good Japanese restaurant in Bangalore upstairs the Chinese restaurant Shangs Palace locate on the third floor be my favorite very delicious dish from Sichuan and a nice chef spend 12 day for busines this time in total i stay three time in the wonderful Hotel and many to follow love the atmosphere the hospitality the crispness that the hotel have right from entry the restaurant have amazing food especially the Mediterranean mix and the bar on the top floor have another charm of its own enjoy my STAY very comfortable room Great atmosphere and friendly staff Autentic personnel espc doorman Premraj Hotel be offer different restaurant eg Spanish Italian style Breakfast be offer until 10 30 allow comprehensive time to enjoy the various dish thx dir a nice stay the dinner buffet on Friday night in B Cafe be excellent and the service be exceptional our host Himanshu do a great job Will strongly recommend this place to other plan to come back again

Shangrila La and it be very impressive New and modern with great facility and very helpful staff a well appoint gym pool and spa and a choice of great restaurants the sushi restaurant be outstanding Will definitely be my choice next time i stay there for 4 night the poperty be a good construction until i find out few gross negligence lastly its be just 2 year of the hotel the maintenance be so weird you go and see the pool towards the side from where the water be enter the pool there be lot of algae deposit there and make water unsafe for swimming i immediately have to go off the pool the hotel staff be not at all professional and be untrained they be damn confused they say me room charge 6000 plus taxis and when i be about to pay they suddenly say 9000 plus taxis Last night i go to inform them about the early check out of mine he say that i will have to give extra payment for the night stay and be unaware that i be in house that night sorry but i wo nt ever visit the hotel again i be pay approx 10000 buck per night and i ca nt get the basic amnetie hygeinic you have many property of the same price Try that this be one of the good hotel that i have stay in we stay here for two

Drinks and Food both be just great will definitely give them 5 star except for the below incidence and not very often i give a place 1 rating unless whole experience become a disaster when the Bill come we be surprised to see it more than expect it be happy hour since we be 6 friend we all order drink and share them on an average each of us have 3 4 drink but same be not reflect in the Bill i inform the person who hand me over the bill that there be something wrong with the Bill around 8 50pm and the revert be the person who take order have go out for dinner and it will take him time to return we wait for 10 minute and again remind that we be get late after 2 3 attempt of try we find out that he have go for dinner and we will have to wait for him to return which be around 9 30 pm almost 30 40 minute of wait in a place like this when we ask the person who take the order to clarify his explanation be most bizzare which be in 1 1 offer sharing be not allow and i tell him this be not make clear in the beginning secondly i ask him why be we charge 700rs for a cocktail and his answer be for cocktail we always charge twice the base of regular drink even though there be some wastage Not whole quantity utilize make to make the drink and i ask him why be we not informed about this and he have no answer since we be in hurry we settle the bill even though we pay more later i go to their website and raise a complain since i do not want to take this in public forum get a call from a Manager call Jay he be prompt and nice he collect all information from me and tell he will get back in a while which he do firstly he tell me that regular cocktail be 600 r while other not so i ask him what be the regular one s and he tell me that cocktail like Cosmopolitan etc but i tell him we ask the person who take order he ask us to choose from regular liquor option only to which Jay acknowledge as lack of knowledge secondly i ask him why the charge 700 and why be it neither mention in menu nor inform while take order to which he do not have explanation thirdly on the liquor quantity he tell standard measurement be 60ml for cocktail globally and i be suppose to know that i do not understand how can these people expect customer to know all this and this contradict the wastage point mention above my only argument to that be if standard measurement why be we not charge 600 instead of 700 he again have no answer finally i ask him to give me all detail over email to which he promise but it have not be receive so far but i like his attitude to invite us again and we will not be disappoint Angshumi she be so nice she give us excellent service we come back again for angshumi n Himanshu also so attentive he also take care so nicely n hostess tigong also so nice she

smell as you enter the staff on arrival greet you with such enthusiasm and courtesy Many of the staff go out of their way to add to the overall experience our driver one evening be a true star Sebastian you be patient and we all feel you make our time away from the hotel exceptional the food be amazing and so many choice Devlin you go out of your way to make sure our dining experience be varied there be a young waiter in one of the restaurant who be efficient and promptly attend to our request the pool sadly let the hotel down as by 1 pm the sun have go behind the hotel such a beautiful place it a pity when you ca n t enjoy the facility to the maximum another negative be the jacuzzi which be not work although when we first go to use it no one tell us this but leave tell us they would switch it on but fail to return be hon its well than the oth option we use the roof top bar each night and the staff could not do enough for us Many great example of attentive and curtious staff a great place to stay and hope to return some day Nice staff from check in to check out experience be excellent use the health club the staff be well experienced and friendly would like to mention Naveen from health club for his get the guest engage in workout and share the require workout this be by far one of the good luxury hotel i have ever stay at it be a complete satisfying experience enter this hotel make one believe that there be Bangalore and then there be Shangri La two different world in the same city the first point about the hotel be the outstanding experience by the entire staff very meticulous kind and personalised attention the people at the breakfast restaurant b cafe deserve a strong mention give that we stay there for 6 day they ensure that the know what we want and it ready every single subsequent day the attention be consistent without be obnoxious or interfere Arjun of the b cafe be particularly good the room itself be an outstanding work of art a very spacious cove to come back to while most bathroom be usually small and tight the space of this bathroom itself make one want to take a much long shower the amenity of the hotel be also cut edge the technogym the pool the outstanding spa service Anam Nayam be top notch the amazing jacuzzi hot stone sauna etc all make the entire stay very comforting the in room dining be very scintillating and delicious quite a surprise overall this hotel be a must stay for anyone wish to travel to Bangalore the staff will ensure that it be a memorable stay Will definitely return my second visit to this wonderful hotel during last six month period my most preferred choice in Bangalore and it be amazing the service be at the high level room be beautiful Huge spread for the breakfast Front office be very courteous i will go back again a new property with a wonderful decor the reception area be a treat for the eye the check in proces be relatively slow the room be just wonderful very spacious and extremely elegant furnishing they have a rooftop bar on the 19th floor i would recommend go there to have a amazing view there be a huge variety of food item in the buffet breakfast the staff be extremely courteous and polite but they nee to work on the efficiency particularly during the breakfast hour the checkout proces also slow Overall i would love to come back last week i have visit with my friend at the Hpye bar we be attend by Ranjit and Anish they be excellent and the kind of service they provide be brilliant after that for the dinner we go to Shang Palace the chinese cuisine and we be attend by a sweet girl MINICA and she be very good and the way she attend be excellent stay in the property for 2 day over a weekend to attend a friend wedding Few of the event of the 3 day elaborate Wedding be hold at the hotel Banquet and Event area too Overall Property Location though centrally locate it be on a small lane and taxi from the airport be a bit confused Google Maps show accurate location which work without any issue Decor elaborately decorate in Contemporary design with Classical element large chandelier art piece for me though it be a bit heavy with copper bras inlay walled marble multiplicity of material use at all visible surface i usually like hotel property that give respite to vision by let few area be blank still nothing to complain here Upkeep very well maintain and feel fresh Staff Service Well staffed you can always find someone to guide you through Front Office staff be very helpful and knowledgable Restaurant staff be prompt too i find the banquet serve staff a bit lack though undertrained and non expressive Restaurants i only use the Coffee Shop ADD for breakfast Food quality be top notch and various option for Asians predominiantly SE Asian all type of typical Indian BF item be available too room i have a corner room which have 3 large window offer sweeping view however the bathroom be bit small to match only one person can use at a time Non Corner room have big washroom with Bathtub one concern be that the Toilet area Glass door would hit the WC if you open it inside which be the instinctive way to use it Do nt think anything can be do about it but still concern as it may damage Bed be welcome and linen be 5 star quality too many light fixture in the room yet be not bright enough the chandelier in the room could have be avoid as it hang too low and if somebody change clothe in the region have a good chance to touch it even a person with 5 5 height would hit it also the only place where you can use the ironboard be right outside the Washroom with no light overhead Small inconvenience Overall Pleasant stay with small irritable inconvenience Nothing to discourage me from come back however with JWM close to the property and usually price competitively the choice may sway Negative Elevator bank be not sync which cause delay during high occupancy can be easily correct with little Expenditure visit the Chinese restaurant Food be ordinary service below par quality of food variety and presentation below expectation Ambience be good decor and cutlery average Car parking and entry to hotel be a nightmare i have divide my review into three part 1 Hotel Interior Look Feel 10 10 for superior construction build and rich experience 2 Services Room and laundry service decent 8 10 3 Staff People at Reception front desk be a bit cold in house working staff be more welcoming than the one at front desk 6 10 from the time to you arrive to the hotel you can feel the attention to detail and the great hospitality very well do check in be super smooth as well as the check out the room be spacious and the room service and laundry employee be super attentive all be perfect i would definitely stay at Shangri La again in Bengaluru i would have rate them 5 if the buffet breakfast be up to my expectation the breakfast selection be so rich but not to meet my expectation as a traveler from the Middle East my two friend and i want to go to Mysore for the day and the hotel set us up with a driver Premraj he be awesome so nice and professional we do n t know the area at all so we leave it to him he take us to more place than we expect 7 location include palace a church a park and view point he give us some history of place we go by and he come with us into the many palace he take us to and tell us story about them he take us to an amazing lunch spot near the Mysore Palace we enjoy his company so much that we invite him to eat with us and he be a great driver which around here mean a lot and he be super cute i highly recommend Premraj if you can request him we have have an event here with 300 people Everything well organize just amazing Hype on Rooftop be a breath take location Room Service can be improve sometimes mini bar not refill or towel miss Overall great stay and satisfied the room in keep with the Shangri La brand leave little to ask for Luxury personify with an extra dash of panache the Chinese repast be a true feast 11 course at last count each prepared to perfection and serve with grace i have recently visit Shangri la bengaluru for breakfast the morning breakfast spread in their coffee shop be excellent with a wide variety of both Indian and continental dish Service be quick and crisp staff be well trained and knowledgeable i would like to recommend their kid play area for attractive kid activity they have great indoor and outdoor play area for kid this hotel be a luxury hotel it just awesome no word to expres it be such a wonderful place awesome food you do n t feel like you be in India you will have a feel like you be in Dubai it such a luxury be feel Experience of this hotel be good Nice staff and friendly Cooperative also i have good experience and good service though there be marriage party in large number they handle their pvt customer and the marriage crowd very good every Friday Saturday night sharp at 1 00am a joke get play out at Shangri la s coffee shop b cafe the joke go like this a midnight buffet be lay out staff disappear to their task clean staff arrive to buff the floor scrub the kitchen and the food lay out be almost entirely non vegetarian the joke therefore be on you if you be gullible enough to land up at 1 00am and ignore that no one be there to serve you when you finally get to the food you ll be laugh at how unfair their spread be lamb broth soup but nothing for vegetarian dish after dish of meat and even just plain rice that a vegetarian may eat be take away to top that food be usually stale or overcook or undercooke or largely tasteless which segue into the large point that this hotel in spite of its glamorous decor and oversize chandelier be stunningly soulless there be an empty ghoulish feel to its gilded corridor staff always appear unhappy and disengaged and largely dispassionate the large layout of food be less than mediocre as though quantity can override quality and behead animal be out on display on kitchen counter or be get grill in the shwarma with meat smell fill up the entire coffee shop in a hazy smoke it be bone chilling and soul crushing if you visit this place a couple of time you ll come away feel as though it be a blot on the soul of the city a concrete jungle that be an eye sore from far and a symbol of the kind of aggressive capitalism that rip society of their character strip them of their identity just sad we have book three suite as an extended family trip stay for a total of about twelve night Airport pick up be not complimentary but be arrange on request Fantastic experience right from be receive at the airport to the time we check out Suites be a treat very well presented and equip restaurant and food be amazing we have use the hotel taxi service and the staff be very helpful polite and the driver be amazing the hotel taxi be expensive but worth the money Breakfast be truly very very delicious catering to almost any taste or liking the masala chai be a pick that you must try the health club and the option for massage be very good during our stay we must have try almost all of these and each one be very relaxing and well do so do visit them we have also use the Horizon lunge that be very nice and well stack but make sure that you go there within the stipulate hour as otherwise you will not get much to eat now for some drawback reception need to be better manage we have request for the three suite to be close to each oth this be not attend to even though we have book a month in advance the staff at the reception nee to be better train Everyone seem to be have fun on their own and the customer seem to be an intruder in the fun time need to get more professional the recption itself could very well pas as a concierge table Housekeeping need to do better room be not clean properly and carpet be not vacuum daily when i ask the housekeeping chap he say the the vacuum machine be old petal from the flower provide will fall and lie on the floor for two day Housekeeping do not cater to each suite keep the requirement of the guest if you ask for tea sugar it come in a very uncouth manner deliver as a handout Preventive maintenance need to do better my sink be get choke but no one inspect these issue until the guest point it out in another shower the handle be loose and would come out etc these be minor issue show lack of preventive maintenance overall a very good experience we have a good holiday one last caution do check the charge on your credit card once you check out we be double charge i be tell that the fault be not by the hotel but by their bank whatever be it i get debit twice and the hotel be the point of charge it take me over a month to get the money back and that too after i have to make a lot of noise and complain to the entire senior management team include their director this hotel be situate on Palace Road a short distance from Bangalore Palace not quite in the centre it be close enough the staff be amazing friendly and service orientate the Sky Bar have amazing view over Bangalore great cocktail and great staff the food in the restaurant be top quality the pool area be a relax escape from the noise and chao of the city room be of a standard and quality you would expect for a top hotel i would definitely stay here again stay for busines 6 day at the Shangri La and can really recommend it Clean friendly and very well take care of hotel with great restaurant Rooms very extremely clean and well maintain Special thanks to the follow staff Mr Niranjan Mr Ranvir and Mr Sarada from the Japanese restaurant who take care of me very well they really know their job very professional the title kind of summarise my experience the below only to meet the minimum word requirement the good be mention in the title the bad be the average food serve in the restaurant the bfast spread be awesome but a la carte dining experience at the restaurant be below par the Horizon Club experience have be improve with every stay overall i enjoy my stay here and look forward to use the spa at the end of the day and the gym to start the day we be in the suite and i totally feel pampered Everything be grand even the fruit bowl very good service and location the only thing that put us off be the laundryman enter our room to hang the ironed clothe in the closet he ring the bell but we be fast asleep that infringement of privacy oth than that the experience of surreal Will surely come back we reach their Chinese restaurant around 2 15pm and be tell to give an order once and for all as their chef have a Monday 3 pm meet on see the portion after a very slow service we ask for more rice as the portion be too small the busy chef be already in a meeting and after insistence someone make steam rice for us which take like half an hour to come and turn out to be half cook the food quality portion and service be totally horrible never will i visit this hotel again i stay at Shangri La for 1 night for busines its a very nice property with beautiful room Check in be smooth and room be comfortable with all amenity and also have a big comfortable couch Bathroom be also large with a separate bathtub along with shower cubicle Room service be warm and buffet breakfast have lot of variety and food quality be good as well overall it be value for money as i get a good deal online Amazing

first of all the Shangri La be a beautiful hotel Spacious spotless the service you expect for a hotel in India and with a nice rooftop bar that provide a great view of the city however there be crack in the service and food and it not at the level of oth Shangri La property i ve stay at the service although attentive be below par call would go unanswered have multiple power outage in my room and only in my room and never get an explanation as to what happen to cause it even though i ask and even ask the front desk manager on duty i also find the food to not be at the quality level i ve have in oth similar hotel in India or in oth Shangri La property attend marriage silver jubilee celebration of mr shailesh mr shruti ghorpade on 25th fe 2017 have great time good ambience food great service specially the mocktail be superb compliment to the barman attention to detail will take them a long way the fish piece serve for snack be bit big whereas kebab piece small oily all the good nevertheless this be a review of the rooftop Bar Hype and how excellent it be not only can they make a Frozen Margarita that i would gove a 9 5 too they have the most excellent succulent Chicken Tikka the good i have have in age but excellent prawn with Miro and awesome Chicken Yakatori with Wasabi Dip my taste bud be still tingle at the thought Try this Bar be be excellent this be a very high quality hotel and have fantastic service i stay on the 17th floor and have acces to the Club lounge where you get free food and drink at around 6 pm for a few hour the standard of the hotel be

particular hotel do n t even say a word and it be peaceful experience 8 i have stay in almost every five star property so far in Bangalore and outside but this particular experience will be go to be life long 9 i strongly recommend this to the people who want to stay and chill out or want to stay for night to pamper themselves 10 kudo to the Hotel team and staff i will certainly come back again Many Regards Sourabh Bhardwaj Wonderful hotel very clean and very modern Excellent food one of the good buffet to try out with plenty of variety of food to choose from the staff too be really kind and

that the amount will be unblock within 48 hour of you check out its be 2 week since then i have never get this amount unblock on my card not expect from a hotel of this standard the oth service of the

Bangalore and have stay across property and like Shangri La when i come last time make me return this time and be thoroughly disappointed stay 4 night Have give a good review to their restaurant in the hotel yesterday for service at breakfast however thing change after that we order cocktail at the pool side and when we go after 45 min to follow up on our glas of wine we be inform that they have n t recieve the order we finally recieve it after 75 min along with a bill that be inflated i usually trust the hotel and do n t hassle compare price my friend notice that they have apply rate which be high than what be show on the menu card when we point out they apoligise and reduce the price there would be so many people like me who would never check like me and would end up pay more Lost trust and they lose a loyal customer when i tell them that after this i do n t think i would want to stay here they be pretty ok with it say ok so this end a great experience on a sad and disappointing note even if you stay here make sure u tally your bill amount with the menu price Cheers Remarkable hotel and service i be a foodie and so i spend much time investigate any property s cuisine the hotel dining be full spectrum not merely South Indian Local dish like masala doshi be to die for all of the staff at this property make you feel like family we be invite for a family party

expect from a premium luxury Indian Hotel i be debate between the rank of 4 and 5 but finally decide on the 4 due to the follow Kitchen be below the expect in this level Food be quite ordinary Grill

despite be an excellent hotel be no exception after a great night s sleep i enjoy spend some time with the morning newspaper sip tea and this be where Citrus have be lack ever since i have stay with them in any oth metro or even non metro city the morning newspaper be hang on your doorknob well before you get up but here it usually well past 0700 before you can expect to receive the newspaper and

good the staff in the restaurant for breakfast be friendly and attentive however the major downside for this hotel be the cleanlines when we arrive into the room after check in we have to keep the

a lot to improve on we earlier stay here just by chance and like our stay here especially the food and buffet that be the reason we book it again this time but we find many lapse here in term of service 1 we ask for wakeup call do receive any wakeup call 2 in the evening the day before we ask for packed breakfast as we plan to leave early but to our surprise there be no communication to the

to see lot of foreign tourist and Indian family occupancy the front office be very friendly and you be welcome with all due attention the good thing about Citrus be be its food the restaurant staff be all friendly type who really take care and the food be excellent the main reason why you walk out with excellent memory about your stay be because of your experience in this area the reason for not give 5 star be the service of the housekeeping department it be a struggle to get towel and i be surprised as to how one department alone can have an attitude problem in a property where in general there be great understanding about keep the guest care and happy if only the hotel pay attention to this aspect it would reach all star level of satisfaction as say it be value for money and great overall experience Good location good property nicely maintain break fast spread be decent nicely maintain and would go back again already stay here twice and no issue with stay Food can be well Staff

reasonable its be wonderful feeling while stay long busines trip with Citrus Housekeeping be good specially Tirupati Restaurant staff be cordial to attend such as Suchita Rishi Dharam Senhashish but Breakfast Buffet be bore for longer stay as no major variety in the food Location be good to stay where u can find local restaurant Pubs the Citrus Cunningham be centrally locate and very near to MG road and Vidhan Soudha the room be spacious clean comfortable the Food both the breakfast and the Diner buffet be nice also but the hotel fall short on guest service due to indifferent attitude of their staff except few individual most staff member be not concerned about guest service they just sideline you as if you be not visible to them i experience it when after check in the lift locate beside reception be not work but no one come to help finally i have to change the lift there be no one to carry my luggage either the person who attend the call at housekeeping be very rude and respond very unprofessionally to my request of send some drinking water Overall the property be good but leave you think if you should really come back due to sub standard service by its staff i happen to be pass by the area and order a meal here the al fresco area be nice and the food order be impressive too the kidchi be nice and the chicken steam breast be fine too i like the ambiance over food and the sev be courteous this be my second visit to Bangalore Vasantnagar i decide to opt again for Citrus because i witness excellent support from the Housekeeping staff during my last visit i

across the city Location be great accessible to city centre and the happen place in the city Check in be fast the room be comfortable but show sign of age and perhaps due for a makeover bed be comfortable however the a la carte dinner which be part of the tariff be a dissapointment we take our table at 10 00 but be serve at 11 00pm select dish be unavailable and after considerable deliberation the chef agree to serve me my sizzler Next morning since i have to leave for the airport i have place an order for porridge the night before however it be a dissapointment as it be undercooke with milk float on top not a good stay the staff while do their good to make you comfortable be inexperienced and it show i the the hotel should make a serious attempt to spruce up if it want to attract busines traveller travel for work be there for two day comfortable spacious room with a comfortable bed have free Wi Fi never use it so ca nt comment on speed food be excellent dine in room love the breakfast as well will definitely stay here if go back to Bangalore i stay there for three night and also attend a two day workshop hold in the basement of the hotel our stay be nice and

Linen quality be good staff be well train and provide satisfactory Hospitality Good hotel to stay value for money Clean room cordial staff good service Easy acces from main location of the city close to cantonment station main shopping location Good for family stay situate right in the middle of Cunningham road in Bangalore Citrus claim to be one of the good in clas busines hotel on all its forum but contrary to all claim it not i have stay for a total of 3 night when i visit Bangalore for busines Staff at the front desk be quite courteous but at the same time completely clueless about the whereabout of direction and shop of necessity in and around the area of the hotel the one credit the hotel definitely deserve in the size and aesthetic of the room quite a surprise consider the size of the hotel the breakfast spread on all day be absolutely sad repititive and dull with server completely clueless about order forget food despite remind thrice and cold food it make for a very sad experience the highlight of the experience unfortunately come from this one incident where the manager of the hotel a Mr Prince refuse to allow my brother who be visit me after several year to come up to meet me in my room for a couple of hour in the evening cite safety issue and then claim them to be the rule of single occupancy room although many hotel have various regulation with respect to visit guest the way the entire situation be handle by them be absolutely disgraceful and embarrassing with the entire experience leave a bitt taste in your mouth overall it be now quite obvious now why the hotel tend to give away room at almost a throw away rate there be a strong need of management intervention solid training need for the hotel and restaurant staff and urgent requirement in the attitude change if the staff especially towards its guest with a the room be the only positive in the entire stay this hotel should be definitely be consider only if it your last option and be avoidable at all cost Good place to stay and easily accessible from Cantonment Railway station very close to MG road and oth main place in bangalore Good breakfast Good service and rooftop bar and mini bar at the room Have stay at the citru more than 7 8 time in the last 1 year its locate close to the city and the airport the room be clean and functional the room service and breakfast be really good and value for money its good for busines or family stay and value for money my experience at Citrus Cunningham have be excellent right from location to room to facility to service to staff be all exceptional the hotel s location be prime on a street with several option for shopping eating entertainment the hotel be equip with a gym spa cafe 24x7 restaurant rooftop restaurant a small busines centre cum library room have aesthetically pleasing interior be quite comfortable however avoid room on 5th floor as post midnight they get noise from the rooftop restaurant due to shift of furniture in our case the staff at Front Desk be very helpful manage to resolve the matter the food quality taste be excellent Breakfast spread be really good if on a busines trip my suggestion be to book a meal plan the staff be very courteous always wile to assist the guest in the good possible way the entire team of Citrus right from Mr Naresh Tuteja Abhijeet F B Manager Dheeraj Rohit Asst Manager Bhupinder Chef Dipak Raja Sucheta Dharam Server Smita Ravi Sagar Front Desk be all very hospitable courteous they be very cooperative attend to our need in the good possible way ensure our stay be

in a very good location right next to a shopping complex that have restaurant a movie theatre and plenty of shopping option easy safe walking distance to the hotel this be a big plu in Bangalore where car travel can be arduous the hotel have nice facility and friendly staff Small issue with the towel very worn which be unexpected for a 5 star hotel also the room key keep fail and have to be take back to reception which be extremely frustrating Excellent busines hotel Modern and clean Small pool and terrace but this be not the good family resort Good gym Great breakfast next to new Orion mall not downtown but Good connection with the new metro line Good hotel to stay for busines purpose the excutive lounge be ok the room could do with a update but be also reflect in the price the restaurant have a buffet option with a large variety and selection next to the hotel be shop mall and various restaurant Sheraton excel in great service Chandan take great care of us and they be quite good in their service they go out of their way to ensure that all customer request however small it be be take care of Excellent food too and Sheraton therefore have an unbeatable combination which will be very hard to beat host an event out here for approx 450 pax from the time of query till it get close up everyone assist in make it a seamless affair in fact some suggestion give by them be really appreciate by my guest the food be one of the most talk about thing and everyone overate thank to the chef Service guy be fantastic and everything be do in a jiff thank to everyone for make my event a succes we recently host an all India Android conference out here their conference hall on the first floor be just too awesome and have some good place to have stall and be for food etc their service be amazing and so be the food we plan to host another conference here in Dec 2018 i stay here for a long term work trip and be with few exception be pleasantly surprised i have good communication with the hotel prior to arrive as i have question about my privilege as a Marriott Rewards member Check in be swift and easy the hotel be well locate across from the a large office complex and a mall that have some familiar store albeit shopping there be nothing special nor upscale Room request be accommodate without issue the room itself be good sized and modern i like the lighting option for more less light and there be plenty of storage i use the gym regularly and it have good space although i do find that it could have be clean more thoroughly and some small adjustment like replace the worn dirty mat and add a few more workout item would be an improvement the pool area be nice but need more lounge chair during busy time Breakfast be include at the main dining room downstairs be convenient and offer lot of choice for western or asian cuisine although a little more variety would be nice weekly as i be long stay i do get a bit bored i also check out High Ultra Lounge once during the day but have decent drink and food be ok there be a couple of oth restaurant on site with nice terrace these seem not to be too busy however the space have a nice ambience so maybe it only because they be in a hotel and thus higher price or not well advertise outside of the property the hotel be lack a really good lobby bar with a prop bar that draw a crowd what be there be more an extension of a lobby than an upscale bar lounge feel and the terrace bar on the 4th floor be empty most day the club lounge be a nice space with good food and drink great for a more adult and quiet atmosphere i will say that the highlight of this property for me be the service Housekeeping be very attentive and even specially replace a polyester duvet cover that i do not like with a custom cotton one for me i be especially impress by two staff member Debalina Duttagupta from front desk who consistently check on me arrange some special surprise when i be there on my birthday during a work night and take the time to request feedback and generally excee my expectation the oth compliment go to the Executive Sous Chef Raj Sareen who also go out of his way to request feedback from me and when i mention some favourite food and beverage item that i be miss he cook me an amazing and delicious custom meal on my final night at the hotel this be definitely appreciate and the whole team but especially Debalina and Raj make my stay superior Would really recommend this hotel for a good high end option look forward to return i splurge to get a room on the Club level which have the add benefit of give you acces to the club lounge which have a light buffet for all meal my room also include breakfast at the main restaurant Feast which be excellent i be here to work so it be great to be able to have basically all meal take care of Feast have both Indian and western food available they make their own granola bar which be delicious and they squeeze their own juice which be yummy also the internet connection here be excellent but when you do nee to leave the hotel there be a large shopping mall next door and a metro station to avoid the crazy traffic here this feedback be a bit late but doesnt take away the memory i have with high ultra lounge locate at 30th floor it offer the most amazing ambience food and more than courteous and helpful staff i book this place for a bday celebration of my sister in January and wasnt disappoint at all Love the Hookah and drink Special mention to Avinash and Juhi and Bablu for take such good care of us Nitesh Saboo the good part about the hotel be its location so you can always go around in hotel campu apart from it the room be pretty huge and room service be also nice breakfast have lot of option and be quite good moreover i try italian cuisine there which be good as well overall it be a nice stay from a busines perspective and have stay in many luxury 5 star property in Bangalore for 11 year this one in no way compare to oth 5 star property yes it be a big building staffed to the max but that be where the perception of 5 star end oth true 5 star hotel in the area should be insult at this comparison call a hotel 5 star and actually have available 5 star service be a different matter i be baffle at the appeal of this property except to say that as an executive of a multinational company i be unable to rely upon the hotel to provide the experienced staff and amenity one would normally expect in a busines focus hotel to the point i have to check out and leave the overall quality of the food be the bad i have ever experience in a hotel in Bangalore it be just downright bad and unhygienic at time the executive lounge be nothing more than a place where the food be supply by a closet of a room where the attendant will ask the supposed chef to prepare an omelette or such i have a chance to have a glimpse of this room one day when i go to get some milk for coffee and be shock at what i see small cramped room where cart be bring in to provide food for the executive lounge breakfast the bathroom toiletry i be in a large suite be pathetic excuse for shampoo and body wash small Sheraton brand amenity barely large enough to take one shower the bad part be the hot restaurant and scream kid run wild in the lobby and restaurant cry baby and music so loud in the restaurant and public area probably to mute the sound of the unruly child that it would have be impossible to host a busines meeting or luncheon i gues people have different expectation and need but for anyone who truly have to travel and conduct serious busines you should avoid this property and book elsewhere Bangalore have many fine hotel and this one be not it i gather many people stay here for the alliance with SPG to get the point who know maybe i be an oddball because i know this review be in stark comparison to other however i feel there be many people at the upp level of their profession who will find this hotel inadequate and inferior in may way i feel sorry for the employee who also be try to act as if they have be train to provide 5 star level of service but they just have not and it be painfully clear from the email communication type of vehicle use for airport transfer reception room service management interaction and overall average to poor standard Stay elsewhere if you nee to get any work do and entertain the price equal that of true 5 star offering in Bangalore do n t waste your money or time this hotel be Fab May be the cost be lil high but its worthwhile Staff be very cooperative you have buffet over here Breakfast you will be get n number of variety the same even for diner you will be get lot and lot of variety and if any occasion then the spl dish will be there specially non veg you get all type of variety just love the food over here Swimming pool be pretty good all the amenity over here be very well near to Orion Mall and Metro station good Stay value for money and time

breakfast be nice and price also easonable in this location Small highly functional and well equip room in a superb Indiranagar location a very comfortable bed a small desk and chair clothe hang space and a small bathroom with shower basin and toilet all of top quality ignore the bright yellow decor a top choice if what you nee be a modern clean welcoming and comfortable place to crash at the end of a busy day if you intend to relax or spend time in the hotel however the room be quite small and the facility while all of top quality be limited and functional i have a visit to Bangalore last

nagar busines district the price be quite reasonable for the location and the level of cleanlines and professionalism of the staff be excellent very efficient good service excellent location worth the stay recommend for busines stay or family stay have a great bar next door agent jack and they play some really cool music too be pleasantly surprised by this cheerful neat and tidy hotel set in the midst of Bengalurus booming entertainment zone Indra Nagar Its bright yellow and white look and decor give it a contemporary look and feel Rooms tiny but neat and functional Ideal for a short layover in the city no tea coffee in room but readily available self serve station on each floor the hotel have a popular and very noisy bar Action Jacks on the ground floor so either join the party or be ready for some wall thump sound if youre in any of the road face room but sound proofing sort of dull the noise after the initial assault to the sense Helpful cheerful staff Small room but very comfortable bed they believe be provide 3 main necessary thing to a guest 1 Great bed 2 sup shower 3 fast internet Agent jack on ground floor serve some yummy food and good vibe to enjoy a night out Blooms team have be very helpful and will recommend to stay and experience it Appropriate for Business Traveller Nice clean room right in the heart of Bangalore at optimal price Bed size nee to improve as they provide only single bed also basic toiletry like soap dental kit shaving kit be miss but full mark for location service and cleanlines one of the fine hotel at 100 ft road attach restaurant be a good one with multi cuisine food i be totally satisfied with my 2nd stay Keep up the good work this hotel be bloom always thank team hi i get a wonderful experience in this hotel i think i would like to come back to this hotel for a good stay very neat and clean Nice stay Nice room Value for money for short busines trip people i d give it a 5 star if they treat their customer better Nice hotel decent amenity but i have a bad experience with the billing service i have give them a great busines 4 room for 5 night and at the end i have to do a late check out check out at midnight instead of 11 be they would not give me a good deal after negotiate a lot we agree upon a price and they tell me they be charge so much because after midnight they can not rend the room to anyone else and that they will lose busines which mean i pay for the room fully my plan change again and since we have the room my colleague stay overnight in the morning as they be check out early they be stop and ask for more money for stay overnight the hotel staff do nt know how to do busines they should learn to treat their customer better especially those who have stay for long and have give big busines to them hence the 2 star the room be a compact single Perfect for single occupancy Clean and comfortable bed Clean bathroom with toiletry Safe tuck under the bed Staff be friendly in a nutshell a functional room for a busines traveller Amazing location room be n t big enough but do the job really well you will find everything you nee in a room smartly fit Breakfast be a big let down strongly suggest to skip overall a good place to stay price be a bit upscale because of the location Bloom Hotels have be my choice of stay for a year now and finally i have decide to post a review on it since its always good to wait and see if hotel maintain the same standard as they do from your initial experience i have be a regular to Bloomrooms at Indiranagar from 2017 the hotel be locate right at the heart of 100 ft road so you can not mis it if you plan on get here then just use Google Maps and your eye will not mis the bright yellow Bloomroom logo outside right next to Chilis this hotel have Agent Jack connect to it so do read further on my experience the lobby of the hotel be small and as you walk in you will immediately get the feel of a busines boutique and a short stay place they have two Mac s place at the entrance which be the busines centre of the hotel the front desk staff be kind and will get you check in immediately i would highly recommend get a room away from the front side of the hotel since you will be face Agent Jack the place be calm in the morning but as soon as Agent Jack start its evening you be throw off from the peace and quiet of your room to this loud and crazy insane noise of people scream laughing and music the window to the place where the water filter be place be locate or more like face the top floor of Agent Jack so you will be welcome with stare eye right through that window the noise continue till Agent Jack shut off and still after that you will find people talk loudly it be a nightmare the only reason this place be get a good review from me be because of the clean room but during my trip this time i be get a weird and strong stench from the bathroom even after room service the quality be slowly deteriorate and i really hope the Management keep a close check on this i would really hate look at oth option to stay at during my busines trip there PS please carry your noise cancellation headphone room be adequate for a short stay Location be great as it be right between Bangalore night life the problem be with the service mosquito in the room when you ask for a repellant spray the response be as if the customer should have make arrangement for a 10 day stay the F B Staff do n t recognise you and ask you for Room every time during breakfast no effort to understand the preference of long staying guest Overall average product below par service and courtesy if you re plan to get out in the morning and come back only in the evening to hit the sack this be perfect room be small but practical and clean the bed be comfortable and the air conditioning efficient the bathroom be clean and there be a safe under the bed the rather small lobby have two 21 5 inch iMacs for browse Room 115 have a problem the one seal window that look out to the road from this room also face a giant yellow light that be switch on in the night to light up the facade of the hotel till dawn if you nee absolute darknes to sleep the front face room at the low level be not for you even with the blind fully down light seep in and yes right from check in the bathroom always have an off put odour i like the place and the room very much and hospitality be excellent there be lot of shop and brand store and many oth place to enjoy around there be no issue regard security generally i really enjoy my stay in addition to the title love the breakfast buffet at the little restaurant next door attach to the hotel apparently plus the hot water and tea in each hall the staff be helpful speak good English help us arrange an Uber to the airport Great WiFi connection Clean space with basic amenity Friendly and helpful staff Good atmosphere Perfect for a short stay or quick busines trip conveniently locate with shop and various restaurant cafe within the locality Clean room Good environment staff be always ready to help their guidance for travel in city be very very helpful some work be go on but they use to take prop precaution while execute Value for money clean room great location supportive staff Indira Nagar be a safe place to stay shop eat and hangout room be bright and clean Staff be helpful and

staff be friendly accommodating and polite the room and bathroom be very clean the bed super soft and comfy Hand wash shampoo and body wash be provide in the bathroom and a hair dryer be available upon request there be also a safe under the bed the hotel be right next to a restaurant Agent Jacks the menu be in the room and you can dial them directly from the room phone and order i order the Greeky pizza which be super yum love this place and hope they open up in more city Pros comfortable bed for solo but may just be a tad ting for couple Room be small but have a desk chair safe TV and luggage rack no cupboard but hanger be provide two bottle of water be provide on day 1 which be not replace u can refil them from water dispenser where there be also DIY coffee tea i find that a good thing cause it save on plastic wastage but do save the bottle for refill Do n t tos it in the bin if ure go there Breakfast be good do n t look much actually have everything my room be 2015 perfect location no noise right by the lift and water station Bar and restaurant downstairs have good staff very attentive Cons Receptionist seem very unhappy or rather dead expressioned please smile or something or atleast make an effort to show that you re happy to host someone cause u r in the hospitality sector Room assign be completely trash beer bottle strew about be immediately assign a new room which be nice but that be first impression have be to Bangalore on Official visit and travel desk book us at Bloomrooms Indiranagar Bangalore i remember how once Indiranagar be calm quite area have now become a new lively dining and nightlife hub with a hip vibe Bloomroom location be excellent right at the epicenter of restaurant pub etc Famous Pub Bar Agent Jack be right at the entrance of hotel which i feel be bit noisy once you enter it remind me of my hostel type setting Decor be quite refreshing with bright YELLOW color room be quite small in size in size with just basic amenity no Wardrobe this for me be claustrophobic Single bed with smart build in panel definitely remind me of hostel day Clean room though make it look appeal though Music outside Agent Jack Bar be echo in room make it difficult to sleep over night the interior of the hotel be a no smoking zone all star only for Location Advantage we stay for 2 day on 19 03 18 and 20 03 18 the location be centrally situate in Indira nagar that too in 100 ft road and ease of acces to Indira Nagar Metro station be fine that be within 5 minute one can reach the station further as a true vegan we be very fond of MTR restaurent and we can reach MTR within 5 minute not to talk of late shopping which Indira Nagar be the place to be the room be modern chic and the bathroom boast of the good and late fitting the staff be very courteous and very helpful the tariff be quite reaonable with so may plus point you may be wonder why we be give POOR rating to this property only one reason ROOM SIZE while the corridor and a gigantic staircase occupy half the space in each floor the room be so shrink that two people can not even walk inside the room further only one person can get out of the bed in a normal way and the person will have to drag himself out as one side of the bed be attach to wall if you stretch your arm you can just touch the wall that be how small the room be what a shame the Architect have take the management for a ride for all the good work do have become a waste we wonder whether the Architect will ever step into the room leave alone stay for night i have the privilege to stay at Bloom Rooms Indiranagar Bangalore India for a night 11 mar 2018 the place be simply amazing kudo to the Front Office staff comprise of Madhu and Omar Bashir at the time of Check In the Front Office staff be able

recommend this hotel for my friend and family i stay here for 3 night the location in itself be great you re bang in the center of indiranagar the room be very clean and everything be spic and span the flip side of the location be some noise filter into the room which wake me up abruptly on one of the day however the picture at the time of booking seem misleading as the Queen double bed room be extremely tiny the AC be badly place so it cool a part of the room that noone would be in and it would take about 2 hour to cool down the room Breakfast be also fairly average it be mean to start at 7am but on one of the day at 740AM i be tell it will take 10 min more at which point i just barge in the service be excellent a neat and cozy room Location be the centre to easy to oth city place amenity be good the good like part be friendly and ambient atmosphere for reasonable price no regret Location of this place be amazing Checkin be simple and quick Let me tell you by see the compact room i feel like check out but cleanlines of this place be top notch and staff be really friendly which extend my stay to 4 day some construction work be go on 3rd floor but still they maintain very good standard of cleanlines i would recommend this place to everyone i have stay at bloomroom in Delhi a lot of time and i have absolutely adore this yellow and white setup but this stay in BLR be very disappointing as there be cockroach in the room the breakfast be also a meal you look forward too and it be unexpectedly bad in my 2 day of eating i decide that my office cafeteria have well option they only have 2 iron and 2 ironing board 1 of the iron have no temperature control mechanism and none of the ironing board have a clean cover overall very disappointed with the hosting Great location though Plenty to eat around and to do as well Staff be also courteous very clean room and very Polite and friendly staff Locataion without any doubt be one of the good in Bangalore White and yellow color theme be something which relax your eye attach restaurant be also good Superb hotel at this price range in such an expensive city the single room i stay in be clean and comfortable and it have the basic amenity include AC Hot water be available there be provision for drinking water on each floor furthermore ingredient for prepare tea coffee in the morning be provide on each floor the reception staff be courteous and approachable they guide me on how i could go to the Cantonment railway station in short the room facility and staff fulfil expectation Location be the good part to acces metro restaurant for shopping pub Breakfast be average Evening they serve good cocktail room be clean and compact Good for couple solo for short stay not recommend with kid this hotel be try too

as clean as at bloom room if you be travel alone it make sense to go for a single bed rather than a queen bed because you get more space in the room while cleanlines be definitely a plu there be a lot of oth issue that should be address Breakfast be very average and food quality be so so service during breakfast be pretty blah and unfriendly a big let down be the Wi Fi they give you two voucher for two device but Wi Fi simply refuse to work through the stay and the staff do n t do anything about it they merely shrug their shoulder and say technical problem happen i also request for a laundry bag and again they do n t send it for 30 min and i have to call again to remind them i be also wake up around 11 30 PM by a knock on the door only to find a staff member with a food laden tray one look at me and he say he come to the wrong room no apology for knock on the wrong room at such a late hour basically as long as thing work you should be fine but in case of any issue or feature not work do n

Smoking be prohibit in the room but separate area be there Locker be there in the room there be no cupboard Bathroom be clean room be small but good for budget traveller 24 hour tea and coffee facility be there i opt to stay at bloomroom during my recent busines trip to bangalore Overall a small clean busines hotel the room size be very small with one twin size bed with a well do interior the washroom be pretty clean with all the toiletry the provide your one bottled water and if you nee more they have filter water and tea coffee machine on each floor the breakfast be sad though nee to have more variety and more people to look after the service my stay be an experiment i stay there for more than two week and must say i be mightily impressed with the consistency with which the staff extend warmth both the hotel staff as well as the restaurant staff i must particularly share a word of praise for the fantastic professionalism of the young staff of the hotel be it the front desk staff or the cleaning boy they be truly commit also love how the diversity of our amazing country be so beautifully represent at Bloom room with recruitment from various state mostly northeast goa and even Kashmir my good wish to the staff and management of Bloom Rooms these be the kind of room a large section of the population be look for clean room professional staff and additional facility wifi be great the free tea coffee water be good and the free acces to the busines center be brilliant i do have a slight challenge with the bed though i d have prefer a simple hard base bed Have often find that bed that hotel spend a lot with the good of intention actually end up serve the opposite purpose but i shall not mind that because of the wonderful staff i d give bloom room a 5 Star Bloomrooms be very clean and comfortable with good AC and nice shower there be free drinking drinking water available all day the include breakfast buffet be DELICIOUS Staff be very friendly and helpful the location be awesome the room be as clean as a five star hotel the staff be super courteous the wifi be the fast i have ever experience the room be small and that why i give 4 star i have stay here twice the second time i raise this concern with the staff and they give me a slightly big room overall a great experience stay in Bloomrooms i would love to stay here again this be what you call value for money you get to stay at 100 ft road one of the good location in Bangalore for less than 2000 night room be small but clean and well maintain all the basic amenity be provide Front desk staff be really warm and helpful we be allow early check in without any extra charge only problem i find with this place be there be no door in the bath area and do n t understand the logic behind it i would recommend this place to a person look for cheap and good place all mark to the team for a good location clean comfortable room and a compact design which be just adequate for a single room Have a couple of suggestion for this experience to be even well 1 have a tough time find this place as the management have mysteriously remove any signage of the property while Google Maps point out this place i feel it be a mistake and end up drive past why 2 Breakfast option be highly LIMITED if in Bengaluru you ought to have something local not even dosa they have find it a major cause to look elsewhere Choose accordingly Hope this review be of help to you we go to Bengaluru for the weekend and decide to stay at Bloomrooms when my friend recommend the hotel to start off with the location 100 ft road Indiranagar of the hotel be extremely convenient the staff be really courteous and helpful the room be very nice and cozy and well maintain the food in the restaurant be really good only downside be the breakfast it be very minimal just hope they serve a few more variety Overall it be a wonderful experience and i would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone travel to Bengaluru and have work in Indiranagar area the tariff be not very high either i would most certainly be stay here the next time i visit Bengaluru as well Kudos to the team of Bloomrooms bedroom be clean exceptional in India small but very well fit the situation of hotel be exceptional in Bangalore in the main street Staff be profesionnel and answer quickly to all your request thank you very much for help me with camera and computer Perfect it a small little place of your own neat clean and tastefully design remind me of New York style hotel room but their bedding be well Perfect for solo trip all Mac desktop around Free coffee tea water 24x7 Room offer a tv small study work table locker it compact Breakfast available from the hotel stay for a night with my wife on the 1st Feb 2017 the property be locate very centrally Accomodation though be minimilistic and the room and bathroom be small but functional the food in the resturant attach be very good the tea and coffeee provision for the resident in the gallery be a thoughtful touch and appreciate if you be look for a place to stay and not bother about oth amenity like a pool garden etc etc then this would be a place for you room be small but then again you usually come back to hotel just to freshen up and sleep so in total it be a good experience for traveller who keep frequent travel and stay away from home go them its a perfect place to stay in the heart of city very well connected and beautiful Hertiage house with garden and tree around walkable distance to my road beautiful room with neat toilet when u stay i be sure u wont mis your house i only have be for 4 day and be a perfect place for little time to be for a short period of Time Next time i surely stay bit longer to enjoy the place more Hope to go to India the next year and have fun Home style decor friendly respectful shy staff home make simple breakfast Walk able to nearby entertainment and shopping district no complaint even check in really late into the night if you do n t fancy jazzy stuff and glittery impression this be the place to go while our room be fine at first we be disappoint in our stay at Laika Boutique have this be a 2 star hotel we would have understand but we have high expectation of cleanlines at a 4 star hotel even in India first the sink and shower drain in our room be clogged the next day all the water that go down the sink drain leak onto the floor we raise this issue with the staff and he either do n t understand could not fix it or do not care either way we have to use our towel to mop up the floor constantly there be also mold on the wall in the bathroom Breakfast be very limited and they include cold leftover leave on the table from oth guest the cook who be also the person who could n t fix the sink or our non working tv continually cough as he prepare food it be pretty unappetizing and really unsanitary we would not stay at Laika again locate in the heart of the city yet in a very quite place surround by tree Laika be an endearing place with old world charm be also very easy on your pocket it be a pure bed and breakfast place lunch or dinner nee to be order from outside a little warmth in their response would take the place up several notch Will definitely go back if we visit Bangalore again my wife book a room for my MIL who be a senior citizen Many follow up be require to get the get a receipt for the money pay additionally the admin Clara do not proactively provide the addres and contact number for the person in charge for check in we have many email thread as a proof i be base overseas and be coordinate the stay on behalf of my mother my mother just return from stay at Laika and be deeply disappointed at no one pick up her call or be around during both check in and check out i have send an email provide my dissatisfaction but have n t hear anything back from the management at Laika it feel like your team be only interested until the money get transfer the overall level of customer service include the quality of the room be not up to standard Beware in case you be book this place perhaps we should have pay only a booking amount which give us the freedom to not stay the two day as per our original plan we book four night at this beautifully design B B with nice room excellent bathroom and nice open area to relax Breakfast be prepare and serve with excellent choice of continental and Indian food we just love this place in the end we only stay 2 night not because of the B B but because of the city we escape from the city where we could not find our way but stay at this excellent property for a week would be perfect if you like the city Thank you for your perfect service and quality B B stay here for 3 night reach rather late first night due to a delay flight Staff let us in with a smile on their face Comfortable room reasonably sized bathroom with all facility very efficient generator there be frequent power cut Cosy warm room love the way the living room dining space have be do up Lovely plant all around the property some renovation go on in the upp floor i think Bit disappointed with the breakfast First morning there be some Rava idli very hard tasteless Sambhar Next day be some Vermicelli which be quite horrid to the palate Bread egg cut fruit be there a slightly well tasting fare for people who do n t eat egg would be nice Staff be very sweet Shall certainly recommend a stay here bar the breakfast so happy that we find this small hotel Everything be work perfectly the room be beautiful and clean the place be decorate with good taste and the common space be invite almost as be in someone home you feel it be all do with love the breakfast be very good the service friendly and efficient it be a good idea to serve the breakfast at a common table you get a chance to chat with the oth guest the location be perfect on a quiet side street but close to M G road and trinity metro station we wake up to the sound of bird with a view to a small garden i have an opportunity to stay at this property for my niece wedding in Dec 2017 it be ideally locate in the heart of town but with very limited accommodation and an activity hall Safe n comfortable stay however provide a very limited choice of breakfast and on provision for lunch n dinner however few eatery be available nearby to offer you local taste as a whole i will recommend this property especially for family visit Bangalore for family function tuck away from the hustle and bustle of Richmond Road stand Laika Boutique surround by so much of greenery Ajit and his staff make us feel so welcome the room be large and well appoint the breakfast be just outstanding we have a wonderful stay and would go back in a heartbeat Lovely big room nice big bed charming place polite staff clean linen adequate breakfast all in a quiet side lane in central Bangalore just off MG road Will definitely be look for a reason for stay there again i have put up at Laika Boutique Stay on 25th September 2017 with my family the stay be extremely satisfying Excellent location just a 10 min walk from M G Road for young people however you be away from the city noise in a calm serene locality the room toilet be neat clean with all accessory provide the room be pretty big compare to today s Hotel Rooms as mention by other i would echo its a home away from home since its not a hotel one wo nt get lunch dinner however the complimentary breakfast spread be very very good also one may use the kitchen to get your packed food warm use utensil etc there be dining table as well where you may have your food that you get from outside order deliver overall a beautiful place to stay in Bangalore we stay in Bangalore for 2 day in September this small B B be in an

India the owner be extremely helpful make suggestion of where to visit eat etc the hotel be quite small and have a homestay feel to it Breakfast be plentiful serve at a table with oth guest which make it interesting it locate in a well locate quiet area which provide a welcome break from the busy city area i would have no hesitation in recommend this hotel close to a true home stay we spend the evening talk with our hostes and oth guest the room be comfortable the shower more North American than most oth place the only problem be find the place the main telephone be turn off and customer service do not have the phone with them if not for a very helpful local we may still be drive around Bangalore Laika have a homestay feel about it we be only there for two night but some guest be clearly long term and there a community there outside our room be a communal area gues there be more where people work at the table chat drink do their ironing the breakfast room have large and small table and vast amount of food make breakfast a community activity we have the infamous Room 201 the neighbour s dog be under control on our visit there be a party in an adjoin house and we fear a noisy night but it all stop well before midnight Laika be in the middle of a quality residential area with close neighbour but we gues they re responsible people Laika the owner be there at breakfast to speak to everyone and give short stay visitor like us inside information to find what we re look for it have the air of a student house that neither complaint nor criticism but with the cleanlines and facility of a hotel we be travel and we like to stay in a bit of luxury even include 5 hotel and the room at Laika be not a poor relation they have everything we could have want ok no Butler but when we once have one we do n t know what to do with him we travel India to get close up to the country but get off the beaten track especially in a big Indian city can be tough for soft westerner so we do nee good comfort overnight we sure get it at Laika i stay at Laika Boutique Stay for 5 night in February 2017 then again in early March before leave India i can not recommend this small hotel highly enough it be a bit of a cros between and large homestay and a small hotel it have the amenity closer to that of a hotel but the personality and personal connection of a homestay the owner Laika and Ajith be both extremely welcoming and go way out of their way to help me make it a very personal connection and they clearly do this with many of their guest so many of the oth guest whom i meet be repeat customer the room be a good size with excellent modern en suite bath they have a total of 8 room the house be build for this the multiple floor of the hotel be accessible by either an outdoor staircase or by elevator there be common room on both the ground floor and the 1st floor as well as outdoor balcony area the ground floor have the dining room for the breakfast in keep with the style of the hotel these breakfast be communal affair give guest an interesting chance to get to know each oth with a strong sense of conviviality engender by the interested and interesting owner Laika and Ajith clearly enjoy what they be do and make this a warm and wonderful place to stay i should also mention that it be very well locate quite near MG Road but be so well bury on a little cul de sac that it be extremely quiet with no hint of the busy traffic so nearby Do be aware that if you be come by taxi for the first time the taxi will have trouble find it since the Rathna Ave addres be such a small street off Richmond Rd Have them go to Trinity Circle then down Richmond Rd to the second right Rooms be very clean well keep and comfortable i ca n t imagine find a well place to stay in Bangalore this place be clean cosy equip with all need Good location close to Brigade Road you feel that you be stay in your friend s home the room be slightly dark for read the breakfast be rather late at 8 30 am we stay in Laika Boutique Stay for 3 night and the place be great start with the ambiance where you feel you be with family go further with the owner they be very kind and always happy to give you valuble tip and hint about the area and last but not least the place be in a wonderful area very quiet you can actually hear the bird singe but at the same time it be 20 minute walk to the main central Bangalore area very safe to walk around as well the metro station be only 2 minute away which we actually we use alot to visit different place in Bangalore one more thing i want to mention the breakfast be serve in the dinning room and at a big table together with oth guest and we have the pleasure to meet nice people from all over the world and have the opportunity to tell and hear life story so please if you be in Bangalore do n t mis this wonderful B B stay you will not regret it beautifully appoint in a tranquil leafy cul de sac but close to metro and city centre room comfortable and clean with all service function well breakfast outstanding owner friendly and helpful this be the 9th year i have stay at Laika Boutique Stay and as always Laika be a home away from

not have to reach for my phone every time to look at the time i be not very happy with the hotel room specially the mattress be with gap and really annoyed whole night i convey same feedback at front desk also i be not sure this issue will be rectify next time Regards Tarun overall ok rather low than oth IBIS hotel stay at Delhi Chennai Frankfurt etc the main problem behaviour of your Duty Manager she need more training to keep up the name of your brand ibi be locate at a very good location its on the main road hence easily accessible the food be good they have a good breakfast buffet the staff be courteous would like to mention PRINCE who do a great job room be compact if you be visit this hotel do n t expect big room and washroom cleanlines be good and the hotel be well maintain overall it be a good stay at Ibis i state here for 2 week the food be very good the housekeeping staff be very helpful especially gulshan from housekeeping ensure my room be neat and clean everyday also the room as small but very good with all thr feature i be very impressed with Gulshans attention to detail and the presentation of the room towel wrap into adorable animal the restaurant be also quite good

u leave your room u always end up find it clean when u come back my stay here at this hotel be for 2 week the breakfast vin the morning be very good with a variety of cuisine the restaurant staff make sure that i be comfortable especially Kranti and Gautam who be very polite the staff at reception Neha be of great help by provide me with detail with Zoomcar and place to visit nearby absolutely love my stay here i pick this hotel because of commute convenience but very disappointed there be practically no room service they serve only a limited no of item in room service plus they add 100 for each order for room service you have to eat at the restaurant for some variety even there the min wait time be 15 20mins you do n t expect this from a hotel like this where they be charge at par with oth 4star hotel the room be literally like a box especially the bathroom it very tiny overall not at all good you can opt for oth far well hotel in the near by area i have stay heare almost three day housekeeping service be excellent by mr gushan who help me aso regade if i nee any thing and breakfast be also i like and also staff be coperative hede i come ist time but again i want to come here in same place all amenity be too good Staff be cooperative especially Mr Suresh and Satya personally take cate of everyone Hosekeeping cleanlines and food be excellent Mr Suresh be untypical and give excellent service very much pleased and recommend to stay here though i have stay here couple of time earlier i could see there be a depreciation in quality and attitude of service Say for eg show regional discrepancy in TV channel subscription with plenty of English and Hindi channel and South Indian language be completely ignore they have only free channel DD Tamil Kannada Telugu Malayalam and all pay regional south Indian channel be omit as a cost cut attitude or regional bia this be a very poor mind set of a reputed Business Class hotel like IBIS if you keep the TV channel menu card in the room you should live up to that otherwise do n t keep that menu card in the room since i be stay in different Ibis across the country i could sense they give more importance to foreigner guest in term of biased food menu to TV channel menu be an Indian hotel please give equal importance to all guest the room be comfortable COZY I be give a smoke free room the staff be courteous and highly cooperative Breakfast be decent Would recommend for solo traveller very near to RMZ ecoworld and ecospace Room cleaning be do daily and provise hot water 24 7 I also go for a spa which be in the adjacent building Novotel own by the same management group it be highly revitalise for me after a hectic journey on plane Amazing hotel and a very nice and welcoming staff i particularly love Gautams

Gulshan Restaurant Staff Susanta be exceptional in their service Would recommend this hotel to friend and colleague in future the hotel be not thoroughly worth for 104 it have standard room size very small and the bathroom be also too small but the housekeeping guy Gulshan maintain the room neatly come to the food it have only few variety and the taste be not up to the mark whenever i m in this part of Bangalore i prefer only Ibis Tech park the major reason be the service the room be adequate for a busines traveller and have all the amenity that be necessary the service level far surpas anything i ve see in hotel across India the front desk especially need to be commend for the effort they put in to ensure that we feel at home Tum and again they ve go overboard to ensure that the requirement be fulfil and they do it with a smile so if you be the travel for busines in this part of Bangalore i would say you can book Ibis Tech Park with your eye close have an amazing stay at IBIS start with front desk Sameer who be really friendly Guys Avinash and Prahlad at the brkfast be helpful provide all variety and get on demand brkfast Martin from cleaning be also great at their service

quick in service and extend help i stay for 4 day here small room i have ever see Bathroom be like a capsule Take care to close the curtain if you land in evening night as you will not notice that people from out can see you while it be dark we all know this but may forget Bed be comfortable desk be big but the wooden chair be not at all ergonomic my back start hurt after sit for an hour when i land at hotel i expect a hearty welcome but nothing close to that as in the Fairfield by Marriott close by the star i give be for the good food cook be good and make you egg dosa on order basi but the variety be less if budget be a concern and you want to stay in a star hotel then go for Ibis else avoid highly impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the amenity on offer plus very competitive rate on offer consider the location be close to all the prime IT Tech hub very convenient indeed stay there for a week during an official trip Good breakfast courteous staff and ok sized room the experience go well for me and have a good time stay there plus point be that they allow outside food to be deliver so order KFC bucket one day for dinner this be not as costly as the Novotel adjacent to it and cater to the mid range category for people not need something fancy in a quick busines trip adequately stock bar and restaurant at the lounge area however if you nee variety feel free to walk into the upscale restaurant in the nearby Novotel if you nee it i just start my 2 week stay at the Ibis Hotel and the you know what they say about first impression be the most important

with complementary daily 2 piece laundry fast internet and cocktail hour snack and buffet between 6 8pm daily the gym be also locate in the 9th floor i have not use it yet but they have 2 treadmill and oth weigh machine in there so it should be adequate Buffet Breakfast the include buffet breakfast be good it have two make to order station where you can have egg omelet dosa uttapam etc make on top of countless pre make food on the buffet table there be plenty of orange and vegetable juice but i play it safe with hot chai no point take a risk in consume fresh fruit juice in a country where

his team be also appreciative i would have prefer an OYO Room rather if it be n t pay by my company Room be not upto the price i pay you can get a well room for way cheap price only good thing about the hotel be it location one can judge their standard by look at the picture they have add to tripadvisor it 70 Novotel i get really disappointed the moment i enter into the room it be no where close to the picture what they show on their website Small sup small room Complete negative value for money washroom be a tad big than that of a plane Staff be perennially brooding Restaurant suck only dinner buffet and no Ala carte every room order can be collect from reception or pay r 100 extra for room delivery the food order to room be deliver in silv foil and container like to that of a Railway berth sound a joke for a morning cup tea delivery Complimentary bfast have limit choice overall very disappointing Good ambience good maintenance by Gulshan the housekeeping associate free breakfast in the morning to get your day start and also excellent service whenever require stay at ibi Novotel surely will be worthwhile it be a wonderful experience stay at Ibis Near RMZ ecospace they have lovely breakfast at Novotel due to up gradation work in Ibis restaurant recommend for busines traveler room be clean and well maintain and reception staff be always there to assist you for everything and specially thank to Saket who help me find PG near to my office all in all a great hotel with equally good team Keep up the good work stay for 15 day and they make it a home i should

breakfast be extremely good and the staff always take care of us Office can pick up and drop be an add bonu a stay that be head towards imminent disappointment be salvage thank to the effort of Ravi Jet Airways fail to deliver my luggage when i land and i be to receive it the next day i inform the staff at check in that evening of this and they assure me that it will be take care of and my luggage will be send to my room when it arrive before i leave the hotel the next morning i again remind the reception staff about my luggage arrive that day and be give the same reassurance however when i return to the hotel after a very long and tiring day that night i learn that the hotel have actually send the bag back because Jet Airways have provide them my middle name which i never use have anyone actually look at the bag it have a name tag or note down and pass along the information that i be expect my bag this would not have happen anyhow after suffer without my belonging for a day be tell late at night that the bag have be send back be very upsetting give that i tell them about the situation twice after complain to the reception staff we be direct to Ravi who then call a guy he know at the airport and arrange for the hotel to pick up the bag very early in the morning when we wake up the next morning that luggage have be bring to the hotel and the remainder of our stay

curtain etc Turn on your phone s flashlight and check for these really easy to spot unless the hotel have pay heed to my complaint Fruits and salad serve in the buffet be also garnish with some oth kind of bug probably edible in nature who know maybe i be n t inform that different kind of small bug have different advantage and you should have them all around you Beware of Anthony Dass who greet you at the reception it be difficult to make him understand anything he have the following quality 1 indulge in compulsive and unnecessary small talk do n t value your time 2 be always defensive when

purpose as it be also very near to it hub Ecospace Decent ambience with pathetic service i gues they get to work seriously on guest service Late and Casual response Irrespossible and untrained staff ca n t even recover a bad service an incident one late evening i decide to have dinner at the restaurant in spite of bad food experience few day back be close to closure timing i expect the restaurant to be lazy w r t service standard and i actually receive more than expect since for single person a corner be perfect i ask the gentleman at the restaurant to clean the specific table i wish to sit to my surprise he suggest me to sit anywhere be that a sarcasm or i have real British accent i m still surprised because the buffet be long and empty it take me time but even after 10 min i could n t even find an alternate place to sit where there where 5 guest in a 50 cover restaurant with no cutlery and accompaniment finally i get the table i want which be just clean i be a bit in control but the moment i start eat i realise a foul smell all around and without a second thought i smell the table n be just able manage to control my vomit it smell bad clean with a dirty clothe yuk on top of that i be serve a flat bread which i never ask for n on refuse i hear even if u do n t orderd have it now i completely lose it and really feel like share here you may have have a well experience than

be friendly with customer and cleaning also do good Service also good very poor at hospitality the personnel at the help desk and the check in counter be extremely high handed obstinate penny wise and pound foolish type not proactive in inform guest about the necessary documentation and almost always cause unexpected problem right at the time of check out the personnel can go to the extent of knock on the door right at midnight to get silly documentation certainly the one of the bad hotel especially in term of hospitality certainly not recommend for anyone look for a peaceful stay IBIS Tech Park Bengaluru be a wonderful place to be at the kind of ambiance they provide there it never let you feel like you re away from home i would specially like to mention that Ashok Serra and Ajith Kumar from Housekeeping be two extremely polite and such gentleman they be always there to help and never disappoint me Such people bre laurel to organisation they deserve to be promote have say that i d also like to say that someone like Nithin Nair from room reservation should also be more polite with guest he must understand that his unprofessional behaviour can harm hotel s reputation and busines he can learn from a few like Ashok Ajith and Aakash Agnihotri i gues Nithin need some special behavioral training in the end i have be very satisfied with my stay at IBIS Tech Park Bengaluru i strongly recommend everyone to visit there and enjoy the hospitality it go without say that their food be awesome Keep up the good work and i look forward to visit you soon Balkrishna and prasanna from the housekeeping maintain the great gesture on behalf of hotel Room be no nice and clean by them enjoy here next time whenever i be go to visit i want they guy take care of the thing thank a lot i think this be second negative review out of the hundred forty odd review i have give over the year i have deliberately wait sometime before type this out in Microsoft word to be fair i have read this out twice i dont like to give negative review but the behavior of the staff have leave me no choice in this regard my son wife and i land up at this hotel late in the night at about 9 30 PM we have leave our origin at 4 PM that day we be no doubt tired i have be assure by the person when i call the hotel 5 day ago that 3 people could stay the first thing that go wrong at check in be the staff say that nowhere in the world at any Ibis hotel 3 people could stay in a room when i say the hotel staff i have call have say i could that be why i have come they want to see whom i call check your mobile Tell us who you call we have rule you know be the word and tone of the staff at the reception i then agree to book another room but they say that the hotel be full so i do not know what to do i beg them to let us stay a night and that be agree upon I be go to block all three day stay on your card say the lady i agree the buffet dinner be bad Read the Spice It review this be their restaurant in the room the toilet water faucet have a problem the bathroom be a 6 foot diameter tube encompass all Bedroom be a 3 foot free space around a double cot i finally book another hotel at 1 AM in the night and go to sleep Next day be a busy day for me Checkout be a bad experience again We will charge you for two nights they say i agree after checkout i be in the room booking cab and this lady land up we have rule you nee to vacate room i get a strong feeling they want to throw us out of the hotel to make room for some oth guest the Hindi word bhagao inko send them away come very strongly to mind by their body language i take their permission to sit in the lobby to wait for the taxi my wife be very upset with the whole experience in the lobby the lady be offer us tea and coffee while we wait for the cab the word and the flint in the eye be a definite mismatch it be perhaps a gimmick to cover up in case of issue later later in the night contemplate the whole behavior of the staff i realize that it be not their fault but i think it be the training provide by the management that be faulty the restaurant staff be also bad so it be a systemic thing i understand rule be there to make our life easy but it be the small deviation in rule that make us human the small gesture like an opening in the barricade for a fast security check at the airport when i travel with my 86 year old father two extra bottle of water in the room when the housekeeping staff see the many empty bottle of water i have use a cover plate of dinner in the room when i land up late and i have inform them that i would have dinner at the guest house be it so difficult to be human i think the hotel have forget a basic rule make your guest comfortable later at the dinner table in the oth hotel i start laugh on my wife ask me i reply I feel i have escape feel so good i be not go back there again very nice experience the buffet serve in night be definitely one of the good among out ring road hotel there be a bit of a struggle with TV not work at time and the remote of the TV have dead battery the staff be good and caring stay here for a night while on a busines trip to Bengaluru oct 17 the book be do through our corporate agency website consider its proximity to our office in ecospace which be just across the road the check in be quick it be well know place in the area and hence no trouble in locating however Novotel n ibi be in the same compound so you have to be sure to take correct entry the room be neat and clean though the welcome card in my room be on someone else s name it be a typical busines hotel so room size and even bathroom be of compact size not too cramped but not beyond adequate the bathroom be tiny cabin in the room but have hot water the toiletry be standard Bottle of water kettle and Tea coffee sachet be provide the wifi be part of the booking and speed be average the breakfast be decent have live counter for egg and dosa if you nee to go to ecospace they provide complimentary pick up and drop in share cab this be a blis consider the availability of auto taxi for short distance so the place should be choose for follow 3 reason proximity to ecospace consider oth option be like like Marriot this be decent budget option in the vicinity complimentary breakfast wifi and pickup drop for office what else you can look forward for as software engineer on busines trip Excellent housekeeping by Balakrishna really impressed with his service promptnes and quality i shall visit again the hotel be centrally locate and have the most friendly staff you will see the F B be commendable and so be the room no frill attach the hotel keep thing simple with a touch of clas i keep hear the automate wait music whenever i call they rob literally an hour of my time this be just a cheap hotel with not enough service personnel or train to service Frustrating to stay except that it be close to tech park the hotel be centrally locate and have the most friendly staff you will see the F B be commendable and so be the room no frill attach the hotel keep thing simple with a touch of clas Zaffar and his team go out of the way to accommodate i would recommend IBIS any day anytime

meeting to follow so really a very big thumb up to the staff for their courteousnes the overall stay be quite good with good facility and convenient location near the tech park Only thing that i find little concern be the cost for the dinner food i think the rate for the dinner food be little on the high side which if IBIS can work out it will really please the customer Best thing Location Proximity to the IT Park Courteous staff complementary Pick Drops specially to mention Mr inayat M F who really go beyond his call of duty to help allot room smoothen the check in check out proces overall very good place to stay be it for Official Trip or a Family trip the hotel and it service be awesome but what make a difference be Manager s like Arnak you be just a call away and he get thing

Bangalore the hotel be walk distance from my office and therefore an ideal place to stay upon check in at the hotel they take my credit card detail and escort me to the room within 10 min the Staff at the reception be well coordinated and soft spoken the room though be small be well decorate have a good light source a small study almira and a tv panel the hotel offer a breakfast package which i opt for i be quite impressed with their breakfast spread it have some south Indian as well as north Indian dish along with toast egg croissant muffin juice tea coffee etc be stay in Ibis Techpark for more than a week now while the location be convenient the room and the bathroom be n t Hotel staff be extremely unhelpful and their selection of room service menu be shockingly limited upon be ask to send a plate and a spoon to the room without order the food the housekeeping manager Mr Avinash Kumar ask me to pay Rs 62 for the same overall location would be the only reason i d choose to stay here again i stay in IBIS for a week in August 2017 below be my experience Room as a budget hotel i have not expect much and rightly so the room be OK Room Service Room service and staff be not very courteous and room service be slow Dining there be no in room dining available Food quality be OK however expensive Breakfast menu be almost same everyday less courteous staff there be no decent restaurant nearby this make eat out difficult i be happy with their service but during the check in they make me wait for almost 1 hour from 10 30 pm to 11 30 pm due to some processing isue but overall i be satisfied with all facility and service provide Can go for it again i have put quite a few review on here IBIS Techpark Bengaluru be a great place for busines travel though the management have change over year its the people at front desk or F B who make me go back over and over again Syed Aman Balagi Kanti Binod Deepak Sujith and the Chef s Satish and team be just outstanding there be a few thing that i do highlight to management and hopefully they will be rectify by the time i travel again as always have a wonderful experience Everything be clean service be great and all employee be smile every day i be glad to choose this Hotel additionally the smoking room be available on the 2nd floor it help me a lot however one small negative point wifi network speed be bit slow Average be 200 kb or something we move to Bengaluru and have a long 3 week stay at Ibis Tech Park write this review to give a special shout out to the housekeeping personnel on the 9th Floor Mr Shiviaha who be extremely polite and helpful i do n t usually write a review but the service be exceptional hence the special mention kudo and Keep up the good work i plan to stay there for 2 day but stay only 1 day charge me 4000 r for one night facility be too pathetic pillow be like broken spine and of no use like pillow which give me bad neck and shoulder pain they even do not provide toiletry you have to seperateky order dental kit etc etc which be chargeable while i often traven and every hotel provide the basic amenity atleast and atleast dental kit soap shampoo be include in service but this be not the case wth this hotel i also order food and ask them to deliver in my room and room delivery charge be 100rs i have never experience this anywhere never choose this hotel again the most pathetic hi i have a pleasant stay at IBIS Bengaluru Techpark for 15 day i really enjoy my stay there and meet great people at reception include Satish and Rajshree i want to take this opportunity to thank my organization and IBIS for provide such a great stay i recently stay for couple of day in IBIS Bengaluru Techpark and i would like to share my experience it be a pleasant stay and i must say that all the staff be very helpful and welcoming there be absolutely zero issue during my stay and everyone reception staff house keeping restaurant staff be very good and nice with the service i would like to

to appreciate your management for have such good staff We me my husband stay here for 15 day and it be good the reception personnel be very helpful Breakfast buffet be good everything you would want for breakfast our room be premi one on 9th floor it be clean room with excellent housekeeping service i want to mention about Shivaih housekeeping staff he be always there for help be on time for clean room and laundry Good food expensive but worth it Overall experience be good must visit we often visit the restaurant because of the great vegetarian option and salad in the buffet the ambience be good as well the veg cuisine cover a variety of south north indian dish and a few chinese the salad and bread be on par with the good in the world most importantly the food be carefully prepared without too much oil or food additive Excellent i be stay in ibi for 3 month now Customer care and service exceed expectation Room service Mr Shivaiah work with Mr Ramesh be extremely courtious and helpful though out my stay and the service be fantastic Hotel team Ramesh Saista some really nice people and helpful good hospitality room service be awesome cleanlines excellent Food delicious Crowd friendly Environment green Housekeeping timely Power always available WiFi full throttle speed i would like to comment of my stay what i believe from this stay be ibi have only 2 department those be front desk Dining the reason for this be for any request or requirement it be require to call 2 3 time at least or contact manager along with this whenever i call guest service or housekeeping call always reach to front desk luckily there be a great team of associate in front desk namely Ms Rajashree Mr Abhinav Ms Zeba who know their duty well and understand customer requirement and always keen to deliver the quality and timely service from the Dining depart i would like to appreciate splendid service i have receive from Ms Rosa Ms Sneha these 2 lady know their department very well they always provide the appropriate option to choose from and delivery the food on time they understand the mood of customer and while discuss take order of the meal they talk in very friendly manner i have leg injury last month and i still have problem in walk they know about this and always deliver the food to my door step on time this give a feeling like i be at my home and my family be take the good care of mine i be really impressed the service i have receive from these guy and really wish that such associate provide service from oth department so it be a mixed experience where some department be really great in customer service and delight with their awesome service and some department be like not exist one more thing i want to comment about the associate at different level that if you promise to deliver some service to customer you should make sure it be get deliver i stay at this hotel for 5 night busines purpose room be quite small and manage to fit in thing include furniture there be pretty much all thing in room but again just fit in the available space kind of compromise for example there be a basic wooden chair with 4 leg Small table with lamp and 3 foot sofa seat adjust half below the table that make 1 seat of sofa cushion you would not call it a sofa but the hotel complete its bullet point Bathroom be make of pre fabricated plastic and aluminium set again make to fit in the available room space no toiletry they be chargeable although i be not bill a un removable gel soap dispenser for bath except for an almirah with electronic safe and tea coffee machine you do n t get anything else in the room no newspaper or iron in room Common space for iron Staff service be good and prompt in room and reception both the good thing i like about the hotel be the restaurant and the menu they have for the 5 day i stay i could see very little repetition meal be well think off Good variety in fruit main course and desert although at point i see a mosquito stick to a barfi in desert section for which i have a pic as well but i wo n t post that since sincere effort be put in by staff and there be a person with mosquito racket all the time this be a no frill hotel Excellent for a busines traveler Space be more than sufficient for a single person the bed be comfortable the bathroom be clean and the housekeeping staff know how to keep thing clean the breakfast be sumptuous south north Indian and the regular bread butter sausage and cereal so you will not mis out on anything they offer buffet for lunch and dinner as well so your food problem be take care of laundry be pretty prompt too the only con be that this hotel be locate on one side of a long one way road so call a cab be really difficult especially consider Bangalore traffic but then again it be not the hotel s problem that what it be get Uber to come in for pick up be quite hard Phone in Hotel room be extremely noisy and call quality be very very poor as a result Bed be ok but pillow could be a bit more hard Lighting in the room be really subpar it be not good for reading writing the build in couch be do thoughtlessly with half the couch be below the writing desk stay here on work in August 2017 it a budget hotel so expectation must be set along those line the room be clean and very efficiently space the WiFi be quite good and do n t bug you for log in more than once a week the room service food be n t particularly great but the buffet be alright it tend to get crowd so get in early for fresh stuff and no long queue at the live counter all in all a very efficient experience Overall good experience Good service complementary office drop and pickup there be no free swimming pool you have to go to pay novotel pool Breakfast be good staff be very good good for people have office in bellandur or marathalli i usually carry small idol of my God wherever i go i just place it on my table during one of my busines trip i have to stay in IBIS techpark Bengaluru as

the online booking detail carefully for example i mention in my booking that i nee smoking room but they still ask at the time of check in the room be very small as compare to many oth place at this tariff the washroom be like a cubical inside the room very small indeed except one hand soap and shower gel they do not provide any oth kit like shaving kit etc but i see a price chart for all these at a reasonable rate for example shaving kit be price at 35INR i ask for shave kit dental kit and haul oil pouch they block some additional money as security and i think they will adjust these from that amount but they do not charge for these they must provide these in any case like all hotel of their reputation do there be two small bottle of water and tea Coffee maker the spread of breakfast

expres our special thank to Mr Anthony and Mr Suharsha for their excellent service and hospitality it a must visit place for all foodie it be a brief official trip at Bangalore and for the stay of two night my expectation be nothing oth than some comfortable and disturbance free sleep however at the end the experience turn out to be a memorable one it be only the people and their attitude which actually make the difference and i must say that the people of Gateway really make that difference as soon as i enter their premise the way they greet get me check in Chandrashekar and Somanna be manage the front desk and finally escort me to my room immediately remind me of my experience of check in Taj Hotel and it be clearly understand that this kind of courteous welcome be a signature of Taj Group dose not matter whether it be an extremely luxurious Taj Hotel or a moderately price Gateway the value remain the same the room be simple yet very comfortable the buffet breakfast be excellent another person Tushar come to our table talk about food and his own experience as chef in everything there be a conscious effort to add a personal touch that be what make the difference the final experience come after check out i be on my way to airport when i suddenly discover that i have forget my laptop charger in the hotel room i do not have enough time to go back pick it up and then reach the airport in time so i call up the hotel one person name Mr Thomas receive my call and within few minute he get my charger in his safe custody he be also arrange to send it to my residence by courier but meanwhile my friend who be a Professor of IISc Bangalore depute one of his student to pick it up directly from the hotel however i be in real panic when i actually become aware of the mistake commit by me and i must mention that Thomas give me a great relief by his prompt action therefore whenever i be go to visit Bangalore next time on official tour i be go to stay in Gateway there be nothing grand or spectacular about this property but i have always like the way it be the front office staff be very courteous and make you feel at home the room be nice and clean and the breakfast have an adequate spread without be lavish you may like to try out the authentic South Indian restaurant that have a large sitting capacity the oth amenity be also reasonably good give the location in the heart of the city i have always find this a very good option for no frill stay at a reasonable price Front office and housekeeping staff very warm and helpful Room service not that great as its difficult to communicate with them Karavali experience be always superlative if you be look at budget and yet want to be downtown then its a nice place to be in not the right place if you be expect luxury i be in Bengaluru recently and my niece take me to the Gateway Hotel for lunch it be an excellent choice and i enjoy the experience greatly the property be attractive and very well maintain and locate in a lovely little tropical garden the dining hall be furnish in the colonial style with heavy dark and well carved well polished and comfortable furniture table be set well apart so one do not feel that one s conversation be be inadvertently overhear by oth guest the decor be tasteful and pleasing and the food and service be excellent Food be serve in a style that combine the good of the West and the South Indian plate be make of metal but the shape suggest craftsmanship of an imaginative order they be line with banana leave which be what traditional south Indian meal be serve on but the leave fit the plate so well that you be hardly conscious of them i have what may perhaps be describe as a Keralite lunch for starter i order fry pomfret a flat fish find in the Arabian Sea it fry well but can also be easily ruin Needless to say mine be fry very well indeed it be crispy and spicy to just the right degree on the outside while the inside be tend juicy and yet thoroughly cook for the main course i order a prawn curry prawn be like shrimp but while shrimp as the name have come to signify be small prawn be much big juicy and more succulent they curry well and a prawn curry on rice can be one of the most satisfying experience of eat sea food mine certainly be there be ample curry lot of prawn and they be tend well cooked succulent and fairly spicy perhaps i may have prefer them to be spicy but that be a matter of individual taste i could find no fault in the preparation to wash the whole thing down i have a glas of good old Kingfisher beer you ca n t go wrong with it it be a standard lager cold crisp only slightly bitt and remain a good accompaniment to all kind of Indian meal throughout our lunch we be wait on most attentively by Mr Boopathi Venkatesan a trainee captain he be knowledgeable about the dish be serve indeed it be he who recommend the pomfret as a starter he be never obsequious and never hover around our table as Indian waiter sometimes tend to do yet any time we want him he be right there i should like to compliment him on the service he provide he clearly have a bright future ahead of him the bathroom be a delight clean well appoint and spacious if there be one small suggestion that i may offer it would be to have paper towel or better yet environmentally friendly hand dryer run on solar power instead of tissue paper for patron to dry their hand on all in all it be a wonderful lunch and i leave not only replete but also in a very happy frame of mind i stay here for three night whilst work in Bangalore my experience of Taj Gateway hotel be well meet here the staff be fully hospitable and helpful and the hotel be clean and comfortable Mr Dass responsible for the housekeeping of my room be diligent and attentive add extra teabag Masala Chai my favourite whenever visit India to my daily quota be both kind and thoughtful along with all the oth small gesture he provide to make my stay enjoyable it be these small seemingly insignificant touch that really help to make live and work away from home for long period of time so much easy Thank you I didnt explore the hotel fully but can recommend the ample breakfast selection that be available each day all delicious and far too tempting again add a smiley face alongside the omelette every morning ensure i start my day with a smile the room be spacious clean and comfortable my only reservation would be that i be on the front side of the hotel face the road which be a little noisy have i be stay for long i may have pursue a request to relocate to a quiet room i love the vibrant sound of Bangalore but do find it a little distracting when try to concentrate on work or go to sleep i look forward to return to the Gateway again in the not too distant future a few day ago i leave the Taj Gateway Hotel in Bangalore after a stay of 5 week the hotel itself be lovely but more importantly i can not fault the staff the level of attention and care i be give by all those who work at the hotel from the waiter to the desk staff to the house keep to the management team to the chef be outstanding when my wife arrive for a weeks holiday during week 5 of my stay one of the chef tell her that until she have arrive the hotel staff were my family which be why they look after me so well Such be the flavour of the care and service i receive the housekeeping representative look after my room be exceptional often provide modest but exquisite floral arrangement to beautify the space each day i would return from work know that my room would be fresh and welcoming the waiter be highly attentive and nothing be too much trouble my stay at the Gateway be greatly enhance by the kind help and advice give by Shubhangi Assistant Manager of Housekeeping who from the moment i meet her i find friendly and very approachable the kind of invaluable person of whom you can ask any question without feel foolish i must also mention the hotel driver whose drive skill and sensitivity to our requirement be exceptional my experience of the Gateway Hotel be such that there be only one hotel at which i would wish to stay should i return to Bangalore in the future a delightful experience Friendly and extremely helpful front desk staff Housekeeping be very warm and sensitive to my preference Great breakfast wonderful spa and most of all one of the most central and good location in Bangalore city the front desk thoughtfully pack a to go breakfast for me since i be leave on an early morning international flight Will definitely stay

pigeon while it appear to have a poolside bar the only time we see anyone there be for a baby shower stay here on work in August 2018 first of all the location on Residency Rd be great and most restaurant bar shopping and central busines area be a short walk drive away this be a big positive for the hotel especially give the infamous Blore traffic secondly the price be outstanding especially if travel on a budget or for an extended busines trip Final positive be the the staff be absolutely great friendly and be willing to do go to any length to help also i didnt get to check out their Southern Indian cuisine restaurant Karavalli this time but that restaurant have be exceptional for the 20 odd year that i have eat here on arrival check in be quick and efficient and i find myself in my room shortly Check in desk be very friendly the room be a base category one it be large and well appoint if date the bathroom be especially tired it could use a refurbish ASAP the bed be not up to standard this be an issue with a lot of old Taj hotel and the pillow be also uncomfortable i end up with a neck strain i have a problem with the air conditioning as well and it be either too cold or too hot when switch off independent of where the thermostat be set i think the aircon duct nee to be clean as well as i end up with a cold the reason i think i get it here be that it smell a bit moldy as soon as the aircon be put on a few oth colleague complain of the same it may seem like i be nitpick but these thing matter especially on a busines trip which be the core target audience for this hotel chain i eat breakfast here on 2 day and the spread be good ive have well but ive also have a lot bad especially in US Europe the service at the breakfast restaurant be good the pool area be very tired theres that word again and i didnt feel relaxed use it in fact i didnt go in the water at all Overall i think this hotel could use a refurbish to capitalize on its location and great staff i
