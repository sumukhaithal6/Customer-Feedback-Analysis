With their guarantee on time slogan going in garbage we were delayed Proofs of this game has been given to them but it seems they have thrown this to the dust bin Dirty stinking toilets There seats were dirty and bad smell in the entire cabin what so ever hence a waste Premium seat selection priority boarding works out great but food and hence money gets wasted for kids Moreover the rest rooms were stinking like hell We were given Dry Face Wipe telling it as Hot n Wet Face Wipe were denied bringing other were not served Hot Meal for which we were entitled and were informed that only 1 hot meal is available that too on payment basis and no coca cola or any other soda beverage is in stock And your staff do not help much but give dirty looks i was surprised to see the wash basin in the wash room was full of dirty water and was blocked by some tissue when i asked the Air HostessSince the entire shirt and trouser was stained I asked for more wipes but the lead cabin attendant refused to give me any more wet wipe saying that the quota of wet wipes she has given me is over Yamini assisted with bags garbage bags to keep clothes and no manager was available The above resulted in waste of over 30 minutes at destination What messed up logic is this The plane was stinking with urine smell and the staff faced the other way when we complained Once landed in Bengaluru they took almost 30 min to get wheelchair and before we disembark they we hurry in cleaning andThe plane was not cleaned prior to takeoff as there was dirt and stuff still in the pockets One thing I would like to say that there was stinking smell all around the cabin right from the time we boarded Horrible carpets stained and unclean We can understand that it can happen but the way their ground stuff and stuff were behaving was real pain we were asked to get down from a Aluminum Ladder and we got down to Board this plane to board as SpiceJet as we boarded the plane there were passengers already on board and the place was vacuum cleaned dusted with cloth sprayed with some air spray by 4 people which seemed most absurd to me to some reason mid flight there were obnoxious smells of pain relief spray and human excreta we felt suffocation due to non effective Air conditioning systems which is common finomina during return all max amount gone wasteI would like to thank spicejet for wasting my one day itinerary of my trip and making me realize that this is worst airline in India I have travelled 3 times with them either their seats are with dirt or the fabric facing our seat is like that but food is much gutter pathetic even Air Histress agreed Did not find the ground stuff helpful either AVOID THIS AIRLINE if you can not much legroom sound system not working as headsets are faulty dirty toilets no hand lotion and cologne in lavatories food is awful the list is endless The toilet stinks as well The crews were nice and hardworking but one of the toilets werenâ t clean and trash bins are full already The plastic waste was sickening dirty stinking wet toilets are cherry on the cake Plane was the coldest Iâ ve ever flown in and filthy toilets not monitored throughout the 8 hour flight AUH Business lounge worn seats dirty toilets dry bread Yucky stinking toilets average food and unfriendly staff Howewer there was an extremely bad smell from the toilet during the entire flight and a very cold Air conditioning The crew member gave a condescending retort and wanted the last word when she delivered the waste bags still told us not to treat people like that not sure what to say although toilets smelled of pee and the service was very poor Dirty toilets even when used on first boarding Pre ordered meal turned out to taste like dead cockroach Really poor experience lost luggage terrible food dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper on all flights and a reluctance from the crew to fill up my water bottle after being advised that I could not take a full water bottle on in Abu Dhabi and there being no water facilities in the departure lounge On the decent as well my partner was having severe nausea and already used up both waste bagsIncompetent Unprofessional Liars and and treat customers like dirt but the cost was silly and the seats remained empty both ways which was such a waste dirty as no one care to put the trash in the plastic bag and the food Seats were pretty trash on the way home â Bathroom was not cleaned and also in the plane you see garbage under seats No one bothered to pick up garbage as other airline employee pick garbage if they see like emirates Asked for a glass of water about 4 hours into flight and the cabin crew had to stop messing with their mobiles to get it me Garbage and trolleys dumped in front of us through out the flight Things have improved but for nearly three years in a row Etihad s administration kept on messing up my air points and forgetting my Asian vegetarian meal requests so there is no excuse for dumping your waste on the floor leaving it for the crew to clean up after you have you no shame and do you make this mess in your own homes There were not enough toilets as there always long ques for the toilet Don t fly Etihad you will regret it i flew with Etihad from Johannesburg to Istanbul with a stopover at Abu Dhabi the stopover was 14 hours I had to wait in the terminal 14 hours what a waste I asked themâ I realized that there is a bad odor on the seat itself or the seat next to meIn hindsight It is clear we were being messed around from the start by the staff in thailandThe food was not at all good and the toilets smelt at the start of the flight in the middle of flight i hve noticed sumthing on my leg which is a big cockroach In Rome when Alitalia had messed up our ticket so that my wife s name on the ticket did not conform to herâ They gave me 2 options either pay 350 for this carry on luggage or not travel in which case my ticket would go waste After 2 hours of queues with many other affected people they offer a useless voucher of 300 which can be throuwn to the dust bin because it can be used just for upgrading the class in another ETIHAD flight withing 12 months but thats good as the whole place smelt of stale cigarette smoke Not sure if not enough toilets or people taking a long time but this has not happened to me before We got letters stating that they airline wanted to compensate us but their off of airmiles and a free flight to Abu Dhabi a city that I never want to see again after being treated like dirt by the airline and airport staff and immigration was not acceptable you cant sleep in the ultra comfortable beds and the soap in the toilets is lavender so everytime someone comes out you get a huge waft of lovely scent not a blast of sewage When we asked for more food all they would give us were a tiny bag of dry crackers nothing else available Customer service is horrible the treat you like dirt No regular cleaning done The Abu Dhabi Mumbai Abu Dhabi is passable and the service on that sector is also the same plus the terminal in Abu Dhabi where we took the Mumbai flight was not looked after well with smelly unclean toilets could have been a bit more proactive in their approach the green fibres from their blanket gave a carpet of green fluff on my black trousers which was a bit annoying so make sure not to wear anything black if planning to use their blanket they seems to be very punctual in their timings seating was fine food is good but inflight entertainment system is not very impressive and the staff is below average in their interaction and approach all Together it was mess I almost didnt book because of poor online reviews filthy toilets rude staff broken planes chronic delays and word of mouth that best to avoid the interior is filthy and the seats are broken in some way or other the food looks and tastes like recycled garbage no in flight entertainment other than some old magazines and news papers the staff areâ so they would have no work to do once the food had been handed out I will not say served and garbage collected Horrible waste of time and energy Horrible the aircraft is dirty and stinks Instead copious spraying of room fresheners was done to allay the foul smellThey don t collect trash Dirty nappies left in the toilets on the aircraft The check in lady wasted some time but after some urging she was willing to allow me to check in but her supervisor standing behind her said no need toâ Dirty bathrooms horrible entertainment systems and below average food i had to go in and cup my hands together under the tap there in the toilet and pour the water from my hands to loosen the toilet paper which had dirt on it and I donâ t think itâ s something I will do again because the leg room really stunk do and such a long flight I donâ t mind older planes as long as they have been maintained but this one was filthy crumbs dirt and trash everywhere bathrooms unclean Despite dozens of emails and phone calls adding up to hours of wasted time this garbage airline refuses to do anything about the missing mileage on my Star Alliance partner account I guess Air India is untruly disobeyed ruthless disgusting Air Lines ever travelled the flights are atleast 10 yr old and smell of mold The food service and garbage clearance was done quickly and matter of factly But the area was a mess spilt juice trash on the deck So in summary this was the worst overall experience I have had with an airline consistent delays lost luggage rudeness with the added bonus of a unproven but probable bed bug infestation My seat was broken and looked like it had been left for a few years in a garbage dump complete with sweat stains on the arm rests and an absolutely nauseating smell the likes of which Iâ ve never experienced on an airplane before and Interior in poor and dirty condition Bad infotainment system small selection of movies only Hindi music food was okayisnâ t the first time they have messed up Did not need to change the flight and waste 8 15 hour time Extreme Poor Dirt and litter all around No AC got late for almost 02 hours andno way ok then i send 10 kg of my things in 2 trash backs over sea In flight cleanliness was fine except for the sides of window seats where one could easily spot dirt The aircraft that took me from ICN to HKG is filled with and smells of dust and the entertainment on my seat is broken including the USB charger beside it For a change a flight to India had clean toilets till the end of the journey economy and inbound was business after a dirt cheap update The return flight departed at 3 pm for Delhi which was experiencing an horrific dust storm The flight was not much clean as the floor had visible signs of dust and left overs from the previous flight no cleaning rude and shabby crew no inflight safety information on the entertainment screen no introductions nothing Little did I realise that we were destined in a shortwhile to land back shortly after take off an unusual stink started disturbing us Unfortunately The stink did not stop Cramped seats no tv and pathetic boarding experience No entertainment on flight less leg room The flight was very small and movie badly By the way this flight has no entertainment no music headset nothing Not giving basic amenities like web check in and in flight entertainment screen was it self a major disadvantage with SpiceJet and over to that they have delayed my two baggages for two days in my four days trip to Dubai If you fly from spice jet dont overweight the luggage or else be ready for extra payment they don t have inflight entertainment so pack your mobile with some moviesOnly one suggestion Spice Jet should have TVs inside the flight for entertainment The planes are without any entertainment option This flight is don t have any in flight service nor Entertainment No entertainment very less leg room There was nothing for entertainment during the flightThere was no entertainment on the flight so that you can enjoy a movie while flying I am not a TV person they changed our plane from the fabulous A380 to the very ordinary 777 which we hate wrong seats seating very uncomfortable main course beef very rare could not eat extremely disappointing except there were 5 good uk movies to watch most I had never heard of except for 2 English movies could do better The movie selection is terrible no new releases a bad choice The only downside for me was the inflight moviesIt is frustrating to have 15 mins left on a movie and then have the entertainment turned off The TV selection was rubbish Poor leg room unresponsive touch screen entertainment and most importantly rude staff It was an ok flight overall food was satisfactory my only complaint was the entertainment system I kept losing the sound to every movie that I tried to watch which I pointed was absolutely absurd considering I was sat in a chair watching a movie on my iPad 2 minutes previously TV monitor was old and entertainment system kicked in 30 minutes into the flight and cut off without any warning 35 minutes beforeâ Entertainment system touch screen failed throughout and could not detect or sense finger touch hence the person behind me kept bashing the screen which was very annoying especially when trying to sleep The overall experience is very comparable to a low cost company The food was horrible the selection of movies is super bad etcI would like to add that the entertainment system had no movies due to the short distance and no ear phones were given for music or tv programs even worst the games on the outbound flight were not available making the entertainment system useless and only good for monitoring the flight map No free wifi yet which means I had to plug my headphones in which became a pain when needing to leave the seat The entertainment system was good but actual entertainment not great but no matter I enjoyed a couple of films and a sleep Oh and a crappy selection of movies Buisness class was worse than any economy class I have ever used apart from comfortable seat inflight tv system not working lunch menu offered from 8am lights turned out as if night time flight from around 2 pm irish time There was a few new release movies however had a poor selection of movies across all categories Pity the entertainment stops well before the plan lands itâ s just under a 3hr flight and my tv screen wasnâ t workingTV s not working Minimum 40mins with up to 2 hours sitting on the plane without entertainment because the entertainment doesnâ t start until after the plane is leveled in the air The entertainment was poor compared to Emirates Cabin not very clean TV screen cut off all the time they turn off the TV half an hour before landing The entertainment doesnâ t start until seatbelt sign is off after take off and stops when descending very annoying Similar experience on Abu Dhabi to Manchester leg had problems with seatback screen so could not watch movies when called cabin crew took ages to respond and only on the fifth call was I told that the problem could not be fixed The food is terrible the movies are very limited and not lots up to date movies from around the world The entertainment unit screen was unresponsive and inaccurate to the touch and slow to respond leading to multiple wrong turns Entertainment system for my son and husband was reset twice then the entire plane did an entertainment reset so nothing for a good hour and a half while waiting The seats where small by business class standards and the tv was in the arm rest and awkward to use I would have been have to even go to economy just to have a tv but they said they were full I carried on where I left off watching the films The bulkhead tvs were not working stewardesses were snobbish food was average It was a shock for us when the Etihad check in desk executive told us during the baggage drop there wont be any TV available in the whole flight reclining her seat leaving very little room and making it impossible to watch the little tv screen as it was about 6 inches from my face The only downside was the choice of filmsEntertainment in seat didn t work because short flight Starting to look and feel tatty and the TV systems were desperately in need of a full refurb On two occasions the flight was also fully boarded and we had a delay on the tarmac and no entertainment was turned on very frustrating and I personally find it very cliche because they can t possibly help all the time and not all customers wishes can be granted such as asking for free wifi although you would have to pay for it obviously the touch screen entertainment system didn t always workTV screen didn t work for the first flight of 8 hours i must say that its not the same standard of some other airlines the interactive TV did not workTherefore if your flight is delayed you cannot watch a movie Not over generous with the drinks whiskey food was nothing special and the films were OK wouldn tThe entertainment was non existence ie didnt work Of my two flights with Etihad so far the I flight entertainment was switched off on the first with 40 minutes to go Movie selection was a joke Oh and in the business class seat I was in the TV didn t work The TV screen in both the flights were erratic Such as still game facilities not working on the seat back TV Not one of the newspapers offered where a British newspaper just US FT etc Films on the flight were very outdated top films were very old During the two hour wait there are no refreshments and no entertainment when my entertainment unit was broken they didnâ t want to know my tv was 43 inch when i was about to take my boarding passWe stayed at the bulkhead but tvs were not functioning My TV system on the return leg didnt work but not a big deal Some airlines have the entertainment available from the moment you sit down until the time to leave and when I enquired why this isnt possible with EtihadThe first leg was on the standard 777 jet and was great although the business class on there is getting old and could probably do with a full refurb especially the TV monitors No entertainment in flights in this day and age the TV screen was the seats were cramped for business class considering I paid Â 2350 for the ticket3 out of the 4 aircraft we flew on were older less comfortable Boeings with inferior entertainment screens But the main disappointments were that the recline function on my seat was broken which on a daytime flight wouldnâ t have bothered me as much but on an overnight flight is something I would guess most people would want to make use of and the seat back entertainment screens in my row and others intermittently throughout the plane A screen in front of every seat playing films or tv or games helped pass the time The plane however was old and tired many of the tv screens were fuzzy Don t get me wrong they are still a decent airline price wise and efficiency wise but they aren t in the same league as their competitors and it seems to really annoy them at least that was the impression I got from watching all the adverts you get lumbered with before your film comes on After a month of being away there were no new movies or tv shows The Boeing Dreamliner was so noisy you could hardly hear the entertainmentNormally I cannot sleep long flight even business class and watch 4 or 5 movies but this time with Etihad I only watched 2 movies and after that I went to sleep The issue with the entertainment is it is unavailable until ascent has completed and is switched off as soon as descend commences had to hold it up while trying to eat 2 out of the 4 seats where like that as well as the tvNow you need to connect through WiFi to use an entertainment system on your tiny mobile screen with a speed not enought for even a listening music The plane was REALLY old the food was terrible my food was spicy but my wifeâ s was not even though we had the same meal the LCD screen was blurry and they started end the entertainment 35 minutes after takeoff prior to landing and finally it was super cold but it wasn t a bad choice airline needs to improve free wifi services I didn t like the food as well but my overall experience was good It took over an hour for staff to come and help me with a tv that wasnâ t working as we are kind of parents usually don t entertain our kids to look into small mobile screen to watch programs Films on offer were a bit stale the aircraft was small and a bit run down there were cracks on the top side near the video screen in the economy class seat in front of me the video screen was small and the entertainment choice limited as well as the food service It was a great flight except the entertainment my kids were cranky they wanted to watch other stuff on the tvA very confusing interface of lights TV and seat adjustment with almost no instruction and i thought i will try another airlines this year for more entertainment on board unfortunately i paid more than the other airlines but did not get what i expected small airplane and average service few movies to watch and not new kidsHuge tv and seat and even a bed to sleep It appears that is done that way for convenience for the staff so that all the head sets are collected before landing but one can t even continue watching a movie etc with ones own as the whole system just gets turned off If you want to watch movies and the like from the moment you sit in your seat take another airline who are more customer focused but it went quickly due to the movies etc The plane from Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt was old and the touch screen did not work properly also it seems outdated not to have entertainment gate to gate Only hope for free WiFi which I am sure it will come soon to every major airline Seats uncomfortable meals were the same old entertainment system The on board entertainment needs an update the movies are old and outdated The plane seemed much older which was evident by the in flight entertainment system same movies and tv shows but the screen was not as bright and was less responsive to touch and the seats which were much less comfortable and were extremely cramped Baggage handling has no problem at all and the movies on their in flight entertanment are the latest Bit cramped in economy as it seemed to be quite an old aircraft with no free wifiso i couldn t watch a movie or anythingThis could be due that I fly often and am running out of movies to watch Entertainment was very diverse and we did not get bored But I do wish they had more option for their entertainment I really got all this together and time flew by without even watching movie The inflight entertainment movies were not the latest and we had to endure the same movies trails for both the in bound and out bound flights which were one month apart entertainment not up to date old movies No news on TV which is supposed to be there Entertainment outdated you do not have to eat but Service good When the entertainment did work it was only turned on at cruising altitude and turned off before decent so they could collect the headsets so things look a little dated with the old entertainment controller On board entertainment worked OK but the selection of movies and TV shows on offer wasn t as comprehensive as you might get with other airlines I travelled over to Amsterdam then back from Portugal to Melb and there were the same movies over the last 4 weeks The Movies in the inflight entertainment were old nothing up to date They are having latest movies showing on board and staffs are OK Given the very tired state of the aircraft the lousy picture quality of the entertainment screens sound and the fact that you can t control the temperature at your seat this airline is totally outclassed by the other UAE carriers I have flown with recently Flight entertainment was up to date with its movies etc Dated interiors in economy and on board entertainment equipment not functioning properlyâ Poor Very less selections of movies and genre compared to Emirates Many diffrent movies Etihad was a good flight in the sense check out and check in was quite fast but the food was not good quality at all compared to Emirates and also the movies were not as great And the inflight entertainment is poor very average movie list In flight entertainment the touch screen was extremely unresponsive and inaccurate there wasn t a lot to choose from in terms of movies or TV shows Very small very limited food beverage selections no entertainment options and NO WIFI Movies not the best Had to view movies in silent era with no audio We all enjoyed the In flight entertainment no free wifi though No free wifi and movie collection is limited and somewhat outdated Ground staff at Kolkata were not as much forthcoming and the only option we had was to keep checking the pretty rudimentary Departures TV screen but there wasn t enough tv shows movies and stuff There were 2 screens one big screen and the other on the remote which I find it very luxurious as no other airlines have this The selection of movies was not wide The large 18 5 inch TV screen in front had a rather dull selection of movies on offer Movie selection is very little compared to other airlines 7 Hours without any entertainment in my set The A330 is not a great aircraft for long haul flights Perth Abu Dhabi is 11hours with lower legroom less comfortable seats smaller TV screens and greater engine noise The aircraft appeared pretty old with very unresponsive IFE and basic selection of movies Some movies had subtitles that you could not remove I was glad i d brought an iPad loaded with stuff I like because the movie selection was pitiful and the TV show selection even worse unless you like random episodes of American nonsenseSmall video screens very limited entertainment selection small mediocre food portions On board entertainment not a big offer Food and drink service was rather poor you don t get a lot to drink Onboard Hindi entertainment had not much good choice is limited regarding movies thatâ s all but a great airline to fly with a must Louis Manchester Staff is friendly overall however the food is average and the most annoying aspect is the on board entertainment It would have been better if they have uploaded more of the latest movies but their headphones is one of the best among other airlines Even the entertainment on offer eg movies etc was a little outdated Entertainment is always top notch given the flight itself was awfully long but the cabin wasn t completely full and it felt like it took forever slept on and off and watched a few movies look at the ground with the integrated camera play a game or watch a movie I liked the food on demand concept however the entertainment was lacking and the quality of food in business class was pretty average when you want it it was time for a film before our decent into Abu Dhabi Not much Mandarin subtitled movies in their choices which is a pity But compare to others airline the movies may not be that updated The only saving grace was the large movie selection on the seat back video players The in flight AV system had lots of music and movies to choose from and they were all on demandPoor the entertainment was not much better very basic seat comfort to tight and uncomfortable loading of the aircraft at Abu DhabiEntertainment has plenty of new movies to choose from on a decent size screen the headphones hurt after a while and have no noise cancellation The in flight entertainment was very limited seems petty to whinge when I remember the drop down screens showing the movie but I am comparing with other airlines the moment entertainment is off they keep getting bored sitting on a chair for 45 minutes while boarding or landing and feeling the plane movemetsI m not sure why Etihad with all its money and class cannot choose decent movies and TV programs to entertain its flyers on thoseâ Only neÄ ative comment would be the choice of movies available there was nothing I wanted to watch During the whole flight the In flight entertainment WiFi TV movies assigned to my seat Did Not work no headphones were provided for watching movies nor the wifi was working that they mentioned they have The Entertainment could be better from a choice perspective with too many unfunny US comedies and perhaps more film choice too My only gripe was the movies on flightsTV entertainment was good with eecent good movies that gave me time to waste My only complaint not enough variety with movies would like to see more musicals romance types Inflight entertainment was disappointing not many new movies The customer service is sub par the entertainment is average at best and the general enthusiasm of staff throughout the entire experience was sufficiently underwhelming Also the entertainment was very very old and didn t have any good latest movies The plane from CDG to AUH an Airbus A380 was perfect not very noisy nice TV sets quite comfy seats The Entertainment was good headphones were a bit of an issue nothing major though and the seats quite comfortable The entertainment movies are embarrassing 4 In general planes need a revamp old seats entertainment half the time hand controls are slow or unresponsive seats flat and hard Good selection of beverages horrible selection of movies though I was little disappointed when my TV was not functioning and the repeated complaints did not yield any thing terrible Entertainment system preferred to watch a movie on my Ipad Not clean almost all TV s are broken Short haul planes are filthy and missing entertainment systems Flight time is convenient and the seats were comfortable but the screens n entertainment offered were pathetic Dirty bathrooms horrible entertainment systems and below average food This has to be one of the worst national carriers I have been on Bad food bad in air entertainment not very helpful staff and if your flying to Delhi and have a connecting flight and not much time take careA 15 hour flight with very bad entertainment system So if you were using your phone for entertainment then you run the risk of draining out the batteries the staff crew was rude and not very helpful Seats for coach class were good but the inflight video service was poor and the movie selection consisted of older films Terrible that passengers had to endure the long journey without any entertainment They had the best times for departure and arrival however the food on board was not good and the service was poor films were ok and seats were oktray table bent TV monitor nonfunctional for the entire 15 5 hr flight What was a bigger problem was that several problems on the television monitor did not load TV there also wasn t working No screens for tv or films as this was only a 3 15 hour flight People who like to catch up on movies in flight have limited options A lot of televisions in the flight weren t working is poor without any inflight entertainment u get stuck how to pass yr time they did not even had newspapers My TV screen was working only once to watch a 1hour 30mins film during the whole 11 hour flight The first plane was fairly shabby and we were sat in the exit row where my tv kept falling on to my leg Flight delay was not announced at the gate nor on tv screens Their entertainment was not very good and the food was OK and the service was almost non existent between meals Choice of movies in the entertainment system is disappointing and are rather old On the way out 2 of our 4 televisions would not work and when we called the staff overBoth of our Tv screens were broken so not even able to watch films Horrible food broken entertainment systems filthy supplies None of the TVs worked in rows 30 32 across all seats in spite of repeated resets by the crew On both flights unable to watch any entertainment as service not working or inaudible food is ok only problem is entertainment channels did not worked I wouldn t change anything for an economy experience besides the movie selection was quite boring and limited A 8 5 hour flight without a film is a very long flight Audio and movie was not goodI changed the seat for the third time the TV worked 30 minutes then went off The screens due to the set up were a bit far away from you making watching moviesinflight entertainment was a challenge TV screens were not working which should be looked into as children were getting bored No inflight tv serviceThe TV didn t work headphones didn t work but I was unable to use my personal tv screen for the duration of the flight as the screen which lifted out from the seatThe food was good but there were no entertainment options even if it was anâ No new releases and TV series were random episodes Why not improve the quality of the food cleanliness 90 of the TVs doesnt work The concerns mostly were the hygiene levels and my entertainment screen not working both the times for me and my wife The aircraft that took me from ICN to HKG is filled with and smells of dust and the entertainment on my seat is broken including the USB charger beside it No entertainment for 14 hours flight You are trapped for the next 15 hours with not entertainment no drinks very unapologetic crew they wouldn t even come to ask if you wanted any drinks or spirits The first flight my TV s sound didn t workThis meant the dining table and tv did not work TV screen was glitchy and touch wasn t working My wife s TV didn t work at all and we barely got an apology The entertainment didn t work the map of the flight didn t go away but later it was resolved by restarting the system by the cabin crew It is our national carrier and would love to encourage but it has most uncomfortable seats average food TV is very far the next button didn t work on my touch screen on the TVOn the return flight to India TV went on off several times finally when it started few could not hear anything On a ten hour daytime flight the in flight entertainment TV screen was not working The entertainment screen was not working Entertainment screen did not work Little bit short on entertainment side Tv not working The touch screen for the tv was not working The entertainment unit didn t work right on the return flight The movie screen did not work at all making a long flight seem even longer I was told by a seatmate that this was common on this airline Air India planes are like 25 years old seats are terrible No touch screen entertainment no remote control works as they are very oldâ Some of their TV sets don t work and if you report it to the attendant they say they will look into it I had 5 hours flight without TV With poor legroom How do you expect to travel 21 hours without any entertainment Malfunctioning tv screens rickety tray tables and seats that don t stay reclined seem to be par for the course with Air India at least on the 777 s that fly the SFO DEL route I could not watch tv charge my phone or relax No entertainment for Kids for the entire time Pathetic flight conditions terrible experience new flights are required as most of the seats are worn out and tv screens and remotes not working Also majority of the head phones a few of our in flight entertainment screens were out of order again without anyredressal from the curt staff The entertainment feature crashed and would not work for most of the flight Also my TV didn t work wellwish they had entertainment on all flight The TV screen was in operable did not work going over nor the return flight TV monitor did not work for the whole trip Boeing 787 TV was not working on my seat crewOn our outbound journey in row 35 the window tv screen didn t work at all and the passengerâ I complained to the staff the tried to reboot the screens but to no avail so I had a 9 hour flight with no tv We now know that entertainment on air india flights cannot be relied on so would definitely never use them again for a longhaul flightbut so far the same response we do not compensate passengers for spending 9 hours on a plane with no entertainment Husband entertainment screen wasn t workimgThe aircraft a Boeing 777 200 ER was over 15 years old and a few of the TV sets and remotes were not working We ve never had a TV on any of our Air India flights Worse the controller in the arm rest for movies et al wasn t working The movie screens not working on some seats They serve some refreshment and have an individual entertainment screen with options of several movies which most budget airlines don t provide Flight condition is pretty bad the USB port was broken TV screens were not working properly headset has issues They are providing gd service like tv music every thing in flight please go through Air India flights only Aeroplane was quite good even if poor Entertanment not many movies and a little bit old entertainment system 2 New Delhi to Singapore small aeroplane small legroom no entertainment at all it seemed a low cost flight for a 5 5 hours flight The planes to and from SFO were very old with crumbling hand rests an unresponsive touch screen entertainment sets My headset on the way over from Paris to Delhi had bad audio could not hear the spoken lines and was not able to turn up the volume anymore It is a very long flight and with kids without TV Once airborne settle in for the flight watch a movie etc to fill in the time The international flight from Del to JFK was pathetic old plane the entertainment remote was broken especially the headset and tv screen often don t work The movies available were quite old If you can ignore cosmetics and in light entertainment issues then this is the flight to take to go to Delhi from DC In flight entertainment screen needs to be refreshed most do not respond as touch screens 2 no cleaning rude and shabby crew no inflight safety information on the entertainment screen no introductions nothing Was surprised to see old and very worn seats stains on the floor and seats broken remote for tv sticky remotes on the tv next to me There are no movies wifi or other flight entertainment No in house entertainment screen 4 hour flight with no TV or any entertainment The flight attendants only came around to pass food never responded to request about lighting or TV screen Several of the TVs are not working if TV display works for few either remote or headsets doesn t work can t believe I am flying from Singapore to new delhi on stripped down version of A320 even domestic sectors are covered by similar aircraft but better version how will anybody fly in such aircraft which has no pockets mahazines no TV screen no entertaiment I paid for an upgrade and the difference between business and economy is only a slight seat size difference that do not even have leg rests or entertainment Air India gets poor marks for their planes with bad seats and worn interior to the quality of inflight entertainment In a flight bangkok to rome the first flight bkk to delhi was a truly nightmare old airplane very dirty with no food or entertainment Also the TV monitor and headsets had issues and weren t working so there was no movies etc on the flight which was fine for us Smooth flight Not much entertainment Standard food no TV screens so no in flight entertainment No Entertainment at all so there were no movies flight map etc In flight entertainment ok no new movies Good service but the entertainment equipment is outdated and the movie selection is old Only suggestion is that you carry your own entertainment and not rely on theirs There was no electricity for the first few hours and they would not listen till we fought with an attendant and after making us wait further 30 mins he rebooted and lights and entertainment started no entertainment is entirely unacceptable My brothers TV didn t work so quite a long journey for him not being able to watch any films In flight entertainment not much choice on international film English Hollywood movies although there are one handful movies available and good choice Headphone jack was not working so I used my earphone to watch movie Can t say anything about their entertainment as I had downloaded a lot on my iPad The TV monitors and service was out of order much of the time on both legs â Sure they can do well with in flight entertainment such as Wifi and more selection of movies but even an Emirates or a BA flight will still lack a good useable level of Wifi TV had a range of movies though no any LCD screen available for entertainment No TV screen on board Then the entertainment unit was not seem to be working Another ai flight from VIE to DEL this time with a motivated crew the movie selection is very limited but the seat pitch levels that The movies on the onboard entertainment are maybe a little bit outdated butFirst of all very poor reception then the entertainment system would not function so there is no music or video or movie nothing Old movies with limited choice poor display and heavy touch screen controls makes a deadly combination And the collection of movies was very limited to nothing However the movie selection was awfully limited plus my headphones and my next of seatâ s were not working why did I need the entertainment option and how overworked he was Yes the entertainment lacks in comparisons to emirates butMost movies and series did not have any subtitles available Interior in poor and dirty condition Bad infotainment system small selection of movies only Hindi music food was okayNo any entertainment available on board Old aircraft no screen for movie emergency landing in Calcutta which happens frequently we find and 4 hours later on to New Delhi then they tell us we have to wait 24 hours for an onward flight On repeated occasions my entertainment system tv earphone has not worked throughout the journey Nightmare flight horrible seats tight and dirty old movies which ainâ t good terrible inflight entertainment Despite booking on a larger Boeing plane for this route I AGAIN got switched to a smaller old no entertainment no blanket The plane looked old from the moment we walked on and entertainment was almost nonexistent What followed was shocking I was told that I need to pay Rs 800 to check in the two bags since there was NO check in baggage allowed on my ticket Baggage dropped at the counter Rating 4 We had few extra luggage because of international flight and they did not allow us 1 kg extra per person other airlines allows 1 2 kg extra and asked to pay 400 Rs per kg whereas I checked online for excess baggage which was only 150 Rs per kg for international travellers Something very annoying about Spicejet in recent days is that you are forced to buy a seat during web checkin else you have to go to the airport for checkin You have to collect the luggage yourself at every stop Rating 4 F Arrival and baggage Flight landed at Delhi T 1 at 8 40 am 15 minutes delay and gates were opened at 8 45 am I had to get into the Q in Chennai airport for checkin as the mobile webcheckin didn t work Priority checkin required badly in bagdogra altogetherMy money felt wasted it did not even work for priority boarding The boarding at Doon was almost a chaos with two other flights departing around the same time from a terminal which can hold only about 100 people The staff at check in gate was efficient courteous however the experience was ruined by ignorant and rude staff at Boarding gate who insisted for disallowing overnight bag with 4 kg as accompanied luggage on the fight was full They try to push you for Spice Max other premium services try to sell unwanted premium services but act too tough on luggage weight choice of seats I was not able to get an aisle seat without additional fees which is my preferred choice either during the online booking nor during checkin at Madurai airport it wasnï ½t until we had gone through security that we realised that the boarding tickets were issued in the wrong names but the lady at the checkin refused to relent andï ½The staff refused to allow waiting passengers to even go to a nearby hotel at our own expenses but the airline staff refused to accommodate it as hand baggage charged an amount of Rs 400 as penalty though she could have easily managed it No boarding flight if you refuse to pay No problems with lost baggage or items being stolen which tends to be a problem with airlines in India In AMD the check in was hassle free being a premium booking but the boarding was utter pathetic they were filling up passengers as if we were going on a school trip Took Spicejet from Chennai to Chandigarh had a terrible experience in terms of cleanliness crew friendliness luggage handling etc 1 Staff at checkin window were very rude will never book spice jet flight The weird part is they are so keen on making money that they are stupid enough to allow you to web checkin for 2 tickets but won t let you 2 consecutive seats because they want to make money out of every aisle and window seat Baggage handling is so bad There handling of luggage is extremely poor and besides this even after several mails complaintsThey make you pay for Spicemax for extra legroom priority boarding and terrible meal on the plane and don t oblige to the privileges I found several customers complaining about the huge excess baggage fee they had to pay for slight excess in the weight of their cabin bags Initially flight delayed by 30 mins and then by another 60 minutes The way they used to address people initially near the boarding gate was nothing less than rude and it always looked like they were running behind schedule security checkin is a joke Finally we paid Rs 4000 to settle the matter after transferring most of the items to hand baggage Obviously no food and a low kg luggage allowance The checkin staff were intractable as to the overweight abount and insisted that we pay excess baggage of 3 000 rupees AND a handling charge of another 2 000 rupees Even my daughter s flight left before time and reached before time and baggage was cleared in few minutes Luggage handling is worst It was suddenly cancelled after we waited an extra hour for boarding Using unfair practices to extract money from psssangers for hand baggage I am sure the luggage were thrown handled without any care But he insisted upon me coughing up 1600 and once I did he didnï ½t bother to check weight of anyoneï ½s checkin bag who were behind me in the queue Bad handling of baggage There was an attempt of theft of my luggage and on complain spicejet tells we r not responsible for the damage of passengers luggageVery worst airlines always this airlines makes delay or early flight these airlines make the passengers to wait for maximum 3 hrs 40 minsAs a SpiceMax customer luggage is supposed to be a priortyMy luggage got a minor damage too They destroy valuable luggage charge a huge amount of money for little extra luggage and don t take care of it No regard for international travellers Poor baggage allowance But my expectations were shattered when the staff was reluctant to consider any request to adjust the hand baggage allowance with the un utilized check in baggage allowance Flight delayed by 5hr and 20 min then they change the boarding gate and not inform anyone Flight delayed several hours Luggage was handeld in poor manner I had a nightmare while dropping bags for check in at its airport desk The flight delays really messes up your holiday plansThis is absurd and frustrating that it has to take so long to get my luggage Luggage were handled in a poor manner One piece checked in baggage was torn and damaged After reaching Kochi I realised that my baggage didnt come in that flight and had to wait in the airport for another 3 hours The baggage limit for economy is lower than other airlines but it was not too expensive to pay for the extra weight I asked Deepika Chudasama if we could check in our carry on baggage as we were travelling with little kids she totally ignored my request and had us put all our carry on baggage and check in bags on the weighing machine Had to cancel meeting and completely rescheduled because of Flight delay at Bangalore Airport during my Business visit to Ahemedabad Mum Varanasi flight was delayed by half an hour and till the boarding time the spicejet display was showing that flight is on time Despite explaining to the check in staff that it was a family emergency due to death in the family and being able to clearly see that the flight had been booked just 2 hours prior at a non concessional fare the check in staff denied boarding But Spicejet didn t and they charged extra for hand baggage too which in total actually cost me more than the actual flight ticket For the luggage also you will have to wait at least from half an hour to 45 mins Even during deboarding time there is a confusion since deboarding paused for a minute due to some luggage retrieval confusion The baggage was mishandled and was damaged Yes ofcourse I agree with readers review as maintained my favourite airline but seems to be very bad customer service along flight delay mean to cancel all connected flights shame to passengers let down during their longer journey without prior notice I had to go to airport far away to bring my baggages Charged extra for luggage for no reason to my mother My flight was from Bangkok to Ahmedabad they canceled the flight by lack of passengers and shifted my flight to one day before and again we slept on airport because of flight delay 5 hours please donï ½t choose this worst flight from Ahmedabad to BangkokThe staff allow most passengers to carry huge bags and boxes as carry on baggage probably weighing much more than the limit of 7kg I have travelled many times domestic and international but never ever water has been put on baggage When I asked the same guy about the terms and conditions doing so for customers product he could not show it and saying as per rules it will be destroyed and CSF wont return once the baggage is checked in My luggage albeit marked FRAGILE in several places was mishandled and the handle on my new luggage was broken At the time of check in everything was intact but on arrival at home we found that the lock of baggage was broken and missing also its chain was damaged Received message a day before that flight delayed by 2hrs and another one the next day that it was delayed by another 2 hrs A trivial situation had occurred with the over head baggage compartment wherein someone sitting next to me had stuffed his bag in such a fashion that the compartment couldnt be closed Also our Luggage was in a bad state when we picked it up from the belt They have few counters at airport so long waiting lines for Luggage drop Also the ground service seems to be haywire at Dubai airport they ask to put hand baggage back in check in when passengers are entering the flight saying they don t have space anymore but we did not have excess luggage problem but at SpiceJet Counter the lady shocked us by saying we have excess of appx 20 kha and need to pay Rs My nivea deo stick in the luggage broke and spoiled my entire clothing But when I reached AIRPORT they said I am not allowed any check in baggage and charged me 400 INR for two bags Flight delayed by more than 3 hours without any explanation Nice service on time take off and no issues with the baggage courteous staff will travel again in spice jet It is my opinion that when SpiceJet became aware of the delayed flight from Guwahati at least some effort should have made to ensure passengers transferring to Patna were given help especially when they are foreigners Perpetually delayed flights one way or another When an airlines delays your flights by hours informs you few hours in advanceWhen I said that my cabin baggage contained food and water and that I would eat them before I board he refused my check in without paying for extra kilos even though I showed him the items The only delay was the baggage coming to the conveyor belts which took more than 30 minutes plus which is not acceptable However the checkin was poorly managed The flight was on time and the help we received in the airport we are not Indian so they took pity on us as we were very confused with the luggage scanning was first class Yesterday they lost baggage of around 30 passengers traveling from Leh Delhi and they made an excuse of fuel compromisation hence can t ship the luggage All times flight delayed by around 2 to 3 hours Flight delayed by more than two hours The checking in was fast and lady at counter insisted that I put my hand baggage in check in and i didn t want to do that till the time of 5 mins prior to the boarding it was not announced that the flight was delayed or AOG and when we arrived at Kolkata the baggage arrival belt was changed after we had waited for 20mins Limited seating space negligent staff and delayed flights is all You end up with if you opt for SpiceJet 2nd time in a month where a delayed flight was not notified Staff in aircraft mentioned wrong baggage belt I am frequent traveller of Spicejet earlier until I had a very bad experience 7 years back when I lost my baggage worth Rs 70 000 You have only two options either pay excess baggage charge or throw items And then when we reach the airport then again we get a notifications saying that the flight is again delayed by 1 n a half hour and now the departure time is 12 20am on 7th Feb which is in total delayed by more then 6 hours already and the boarding opens at 12 50am without any informationwait was less than priority checkin There was no announcement or display of airline for checkin even 3 hours before flight time Last minute before boarding they will weigh your baggage its trap to loot customers weigh machine is false even single kilo excess will not be allowed last minute even you can not return goods to duty free you are force to pay excess baggage Because of the flight delay I somehow managed to postpone my meeting Me my wife were travelling and avoided a hard copy of the printed ticket prior to the airport mailed my wife ticket to her to avoid waiting at the entrance when we reached she showed and was let in when my turn came my mail just vanished and could not be sighted sought help from son at homeBeing confused we took our luggages and dropped again while checking in for Dhaka flight It was the travelers who stood by themselves in a que after a 15 min delay from the scheduled time is when the spicejet associate mentioned about the delay with a reason of flight just being landed and boarding will start in next 5 mins and will try to take off on the scheduled time Luggage were damaged Last week when I flew with them from Dubai boarding on this airline from Dubai for the first time I had a terrible experience at the boarding gate The flight delayed by 20 minutes When I got my luggage I found that lock was missing and chain of the bag was broken and slightly opened When we got charged for extra baggage several people appeared one to fill out a form with carbon paper if you know what THAT is then another to work the credit card machine They dnt update any information regarding gate change flight delays on screen even the ground staff is terrible Check in Baggage problem poorly handled baggageThe fee that she charged me didn t discount the weight of free carry on luggage that you are allowed to take with on the flight The staff was helpless as he was unaware of the excess handcarriage charges those airline guys are making at the boarding gate All I felt about Spicejet is that they are ready to rip you off with their bogus rules specifically baggage I almost missed the flight because its written that its boarding for Mumbai flight and relaxed thinking that Hyderabad flight is not ready Due to this delay many passengers from the plane lost our connection flights and had to pay a substantial amount of money to change our flight tickets We told the Spice Jet staff that they could hold onto the checked in luggage or even hand it overat the end of the day for everything there is money and allowing elderly woman with kids for quick checkin etc is all missingCalled they did to inform me that the damage to the luggage is not extensive enough for them to attend to They do not explicitly state that the cabin baggage is inclusive of the laptop bag and then make this as a reason to charge you a hefty amount during check in which leaves you with no option but to pay the huge sum of money to them and he said wait till u get ur baggageTicketing online experience was hassle free Check in Did an over the counter check in cum baggage drop On receiving luggage one of the baggage was completely drenched with water Flight was on time but boarding was delayed due to slow processing by staff members But baggage delivery was delayed Earlier my experience was not that good as I experienced flight delay multiple times we weer told 08 50 is our boarding time when we went to boarding gate we came to again delayedThe service quality at the boarding gate was very poor they merged two flight baggage in one pick up point which was sad many families with children were present at the airport waiting to board the airline the airline could have arranged to put the passengers on alternative flights destined for kolkata Luggage delivery at Chennai was delayed by 15 to 25 minutes Despite priority baggage our bags came out last actually When I reach to airport and goes for check in then lady shamelessly said that you can not carry your luggageWe ultimately ended up paying for the luggage because there was no other choice Flight delayed by 1 5 hours yet there was no communication by Spicejet But than also it is not reliable that flights delayed Flight delayed no staff to provide information Travel Slightly delayed departure carried over into 30 minutes of delay in arrival also I could see that some of the people were not being charged for the extra luggage whereas I paid for both the flights why there was favored response for different people Terrible is an understatement sky high ticket prices opportunistic check in staff charged me for excess baggage at actual extra baggage worst seating arrangement in aircraft with no leg space for long legged passenger like me discourteous cabin crew worst flight ever taken by me immigration clearance and baggage claim in dubai took only 45 min The staff earlier said that if I reduce my luggage then I don t have to pay In to Flight Delays to Air Time you are late and we had loaded our luggage bags in the flight No help given to sole travellers most travel in groups also disappointed they did not offer the same service as Air India on weight for hold luggageThe counter staff very clodly said you are overweight and this wont be allowed her exact words I mean if I pay excess baggage then suddenly it would be allowed so why do talk about allowing or not allowing Ms Deepansha tried to stuff the baggage in and on being unable to do so shifted it to another compartment There was a flight delay from the original time and this has caused us inconvenience time and additional cab fares after we landed at Kolkata The problem started right from the beginning with boarding which was started late Received only half luggage at the arrival and was informed that the other half will receive itLuggage was less than normal I reached 5 25PM to the SpiceJet counter for 6 05PM flight check in was closed by that time but boarding was still going onWe tried to convince her about our prior flight and the same luggage was there with us with no addition I dont know how many passengers missed appointments Connecting flights On arrival at delhi our priority tagged luggage came in the last when all people went off after collecting their s Instead of just offloading my bag they took me to the baggage loading area to remove it from my bag when we told her that we would rather have our family member in Ahmedabad pick up excess luggage she became very rude Baggage handling Usual efficient nothing to complain about At this point station Manager GK Singh would come to that passenger and threatened him that his baggage will not be scanned again if he doesn t pack the bag within 5 minutes I was not allowed priority in baggage but only checkin I expect SpiceJet to pay for my ticket fare and the other travel expenses and the business loss happened due to their flight cancellation My only mistake was I didn t check the baggage allowance when I booked the tickets so when we were checking in I had to pay a little extra it wasn t a great fortune like certain other airlines who shall remain namelessI was scheduled to travel to kochi from Delhi by 7 30pm Flight and just before the boarding time it was intimated that the flight got delayed by more than 4 hours At boarding staff was weighing luggage of every passenger On arrival the baggage was delayed although I had priority baggage out Apparently our travel agent hadn t booked check in luggage and we got to know this at the counter If airline could have sent flight delay message early I could have utilized the time in other productivity activity instead of waiting at airport The security check and baggage booking was done swiftly in spite of the rush at thr Bagdogra airport I approached a DANATA staff hanging around far from this belt altered them and then could received my baggage and all other baggage ofWe were 7 in a group and all of my fellow had there luggage while mine was missing Then after luggage from Air India flight was cleared they traced and put up our luggage on the carousel and that after nearly an hour but they disappointed me on baggage delivery although my bag was tagged with priorityAfter 1 hours delay flight took off at 12 50Pm Bad thing is that they don t apologize for this delay inconvenient there was no flight intimation put on the screens till checkin time Only gripe was that the ground staff were a bit rigid specially the ones at the Baggage screening section who made me open my bag meant forIt is a very unpleasant inconvenience for the passengers who abide by the baggage rules and wish to have a peaceful flight leaving at midnight After the boarding was over and all the passengers were already on the plane Spicejet crew allowed a group o people standing on the plane stares to literally stop the plane from departing You re luggage is not automatically transit in cases of connection flights Staff at the counter sold to me spice max at the time of checkin When we go to airport the person who do check in do weight our baggage and tell me that you have to pay money for excess weight i explain i have 3 tickets and my weight is notThe only option that is available for you while doing web checkin is obviously the middle seat of every row and why would 2 people traveling together book 2 seats in different rows I did not have any checked in luggageThe only issue we had was that our baggage was damaged during the transit I would like to urge the airline to give the latest information on the website regarding baggage policies so that people don t have to go through the same hassle at the airport Travelled pune to dubai return on spicejet good value for money only one thing that should be improved after landing in pune luggage service is very slow it almost took 35 minutes for luggage to come on the belt rest all ok as its tickets are very cheapfirst of all i waited in the queue of checkin for 20minsInternational travellers stay away from this airline flight delayed flight goes to a different terminalNot receiving any helpful information from her we went into the building where others were collecting their baggage What matters is that the crew did nothing but waited for 1 5 hours after the boarding was finished they just gives you tickes not allocating seats even neither gives any information about luggage or checkin rules or their so called process because they want to loot you My baggage came out quickly My baggage came out after non priority baggage even though I had paid for priority baggage delivery The baggage restrictions of 15kgs is another irritant min they should allow 20kgs didnï ½t informed the timing anyone till the boarding there was no communication from their side my spice max co passengers post all economy baggage arrivedI think the ground staff allowed everyone to take as much luggage in the cabin as they pleased I mean i don t understand of logic behind that what make deference between carry a luggage with 7 kg in aircraft Flight cancellation interruption cover of ICICI Lombard is only applicable if flight is cancelled due to Earthquake Storm flood inundation cyclone tempest fog optional cover and Terrorism This time getting boarding pass makes delay in counter they send message 180 minutes beforeSpicejet have not took responsibility in delivering the checkin baggage soon and they took almost 45mins to dispatch our check in baggage when we asked a spicejet personal he is not respondingCompensation for flight delay were good No announcement was made about the priority boardingNo Trouble in Boarding Spicejet supportive staff should take up some responsibility and talk to there customer and explain the issues they r facing in providing the check in baggages While travelling from Kolkata to Mumbai I did not face any problem but on my return I was forced to pay Rs 400 for the same baggage on the ground that it was oversize and the baggage was checked in If you donï ½t pay for baggage in advance then it may cost the same amount as you have paid for your seat Staff is very unorganized in flight boarding procedures with no preference given to handicapped and senior citizens Chandni the staff kept telling our baggage was overweight and had to pay for the soaked baggage as well inspite of us being drenched in the rain No one turned up or even seen near the baggage belt The baggage allowance is only 15kg not enough when transferring from an international flight where the allowance is more than double that Infact they should have delayed our boarding which would have been better Do not fly Spicejet because they charge exorbitant fees for excess baggage We chose this flight because of the timing it seemed a reasonable cost but on getting the details we ended up playing for extras the baggage was only 15kgsIf you are travelling with a lot of baggage be prepared to pay almost as much as your flight cost if I can get my wife to sit there and got same reply that the flight is full didn t understand how was any1 getting on that seat now since the boarding had finished and captain had ordered for the doors to be closed While I was arranging my stuff again Station Manager Mr GK Singh came to me and threatened that within 5 minutes I need to complete checkinBut charging extra for all seats for online checkin makes it cumbersome SMS about flight delay was received just 30 minutes before departure I m flying for last 10 years and have never seen such kind of bargaining with luggage price at the airport had a v troublesome experience with airlines careless handling baggage recheckin nearly missed connected flight The checkin was a little different as you depart from the Airforce base in Agra so the security was a little tighter than usual and everthing took a little longer When the weather conditions are bad the flights can get delayed for several hours while the non stop rain caused us additional baggage weight and there was no one willing to listen I requested the check in staff to allow me the same as cabin baggage since its arrival at Kolkata was at 22 30 hours And the experience gets worse when your duty free baggage is also included in the 7 kg hand bag allowance with not even a waiver for 1 kg if your carrying checkin bag you have to pay for that as per the weight As per local airport staff this particular flight delays every single day Flight time was at 9 30 they closed checkin desk at 8 30 and on paper checkin time was 8 45 they didnt allow me to get in forcefully i was made to book next flight tickets out of no option The helpline says baggage allowance is increased counter person refuses to discuss ICICI Lombard travel insurance did not honour the claim stating that flight cancellation due to technical reasons is not covered I have never been charged for cabin baggage The flight of 2 05am was announced delayed at 1 45am when all were at the boarding gate They always want money forextra baggage and they dont understand the meaning of Being Flexible Another one was told you are carrying 3 bags whereas he had paid for his extra luggageDisorganised boarding and poor support from cabin staff results in uncomfortable experiences which add to the stress of flying At the airport we were told and we had to arrange our Baggage asked our Driver to take back the surplus The aircraft was a small turboprop Bombardier Q400 but the overhead bins did accommodate standard carryon luggage albeit sideways They told me that we can still make it however there would be no help since the flight delay is not of 1 5 hours as per their policy Unhelpful crew did not make any attempt to serve me my prepaid dinner in 1 hr did not help me in getting space for my cabin baggage promised to changeit and did not promised to bring it to me after landing but did not air hostess Not giving basic amenities like web check in and in flight entertainment screen was it self a major disadvantage with SpiceJet and over to that they have delayed my two baggages for two days in my four days trip to Dubai When I rerturned I spoke to the gentleman in the next counter and while handing us our boarding cards he said you see our staff is under a lot of pressure but you should have requested for a supervisor Said we cannot carry luggage and took Rs 1200 for just one big suitcase Spice Jet if you have a really rule and policy for baggage then why are you negotiating with price my luggage bag was 3 kg OnlyOur flights were on time didn t have to wait too long for the luggages please have your representative at the luggage belt on arrival hall as if priority baggage arrives post all other baggage a spice max customer will be unhappy since you do not have a rep on the baggage below youStaff had zero empathy and was getting offensive when questioned why was wheel chair passenger not boarded first I was told by their crew donï ½t teach us how to do the boarding However the baggage kept us waiting for very long Secondly our baggage was the last to arrive when we landed at Delhi How can you accept a 27 KG bag of two people combined luggage and not cabin bag The ground staff actually lacks customer guidance while boarding which eats up a lot of time and its irritating when you have Senior Citizens travelling along with you Once out again baggage didn t arrive waited for baggage for a very long time We were with in the cabin and check in baggage limits but because of the executive lack of knowledge we had to pay extra for the luggage and send all through check in baggage When Mr Aman weighed my baggage it was 1 5 KG extra weight Many times I travelled with any other airlines in spite of check in luggage being extra with 2 3 kgsDon t carry any fragile thing in your baggage because they don t how to handle your belongingsstarting with the bad experience they didn t allow me to drop in my baggage 3hr before departure I had to wait outside the check in area where there was nothing to kill your time no duty free purchase no additional luggage even check in baggage was 7 kg only The counter staff is not cooperative 25 min is left for flight departure which isOnly part that is not well organized is priority boarding even when there is an aero bridge If you fly from spice jet dont overweight the luggage or else be ready for extra payment they don t have inflight entertainment so pack your mobile with some moviesonboard light not working and lastly in handling my luggage breaking of my laptop When I went to do web checkin i was in for shock baggage took almost one hour to come DEL Kol flight on SundaySo for weeks I contacted SpiceJet as I had received news of the flight cancellation only from SpiceJet and instruction to contact them for a refund and all they kept saying was that they hadFlight from Jabalpur is costly if not booked well in advance and since the aircraft is small do not carry big size hand baggage we usually carry in boing or airbus as baggage hold on top of seat is smaller in size Thirdly when we approached the airport check in counter we were told that only if we pay Rs 1000 extra per person we could have 2 seats together Receiving of luggage also delayed Right from the departure arena at Swarnabhumi Airport Bangkok they do not have sufficient counters to manage the public for Luggage Check in and have to stand atleast for 2 hours in queque waiting for a turn as their staff is extremely slow and lethargic as compared to other airlines but it was not excesses luggage why i charged because i was not caring a 7 kg of luggage my total weight of luggageI was disappointed from the time I got there as there was no priority check in the flight was delayed no priority boarding definitely no significantly more leg room complementary meal was appalling and the only saving grace was that my luggage was delivered first THEY COLLECT RS1000 FOR MAXX THE OVERHEAD bins used to have stickers for MAXX customers when the bags of those who board first put their bags there the PAYING MAXX customer has to out his luggage elsewhere All I wanted the international travellers to be wary of is that baggage allowance on domestic air lines was 15 kg per person Some passengers with 2 or more hand baggage weighing more than 7kg were not charged thereby discriminating between passengers They did not loose my baggage Very bad services 60 passengers baggages got after 3days Thereï ½s absolutely no system in place for boarding and queuing Airline staff were using their whims and fancies for charging for hand baggage even that just before boarding the aircraft Unpleasant checkin personnel filthy seats and surroundings Then she instructed a ground staff to escort me fast through security when there was a big queue and then to the boarding gate in time don t allow cabin baggage They did not allow additional 2 kgs in the luggageWhen I got my bag she checked both my baggage and hand luggage and said your hand luggage is heavy please pay for that Isn t it the responsibility to mark seat number and return the change 4 Delhi to Mumbai with same luggage I carried which I came back with one hand bag and one laptop bag but delay departure One should not fly with SpiceJet if concerned about luggage At Check in counter the lady said cabin baggage 7 kg including duty free purchases EXCLUDING Laptop bag We travel from spice jet from Goa to Ahmedabad We have one child the company policy for hand baggage weight is 7 kg per traveler our child is 7 year old so we pack our all luggage in one bag If such delay would have been made by a passenger will the airlines wait for the passenger NO We were their Priority Customers but we have not given such treatment and in Breakfast they do not have even varieties of Juices to serve and our seats were in front but no space to keep your hand luggage which they have accommodated somewhere elseThe baggage came on the carousel pretty quickly Got to the airport on time having paid extra for SPICE MAX expecting that I would board the plane before others as it said I was guaranteed significantly more leg room complementary meal priority check in priority boarding and priority luggage delivery But the boarding started only at 12 30am and the plane left the tarmac by 1 20am only Even if you are a family you will be charged separately based on the individual baggage which is ridiculous Luggage quickly arrived at the carousel The airlines seems to be only interested in selling various goods and facilities like seat location leg space priority boarding a farce anyway food merchandise etc etc at exorbitant rates rather than providing basic services to the customers To make it worse my baggage was mishandled No priority check in No priority bag handling Due to this my baggage over exceeded the limit attendants really slack no attention to seat belts seat position or luggage budget airlineThe que for the free counters were too long and they were taking unnecessary long time for each checkin Itï ½s as if Spice Jet is doing everything it can in order not to send my luggage to Israel Secondly some airports have screening of check in luggage and some don t so if you happen to see one just get your luggage pass through it had alot of excess baggage and didn t have to pay and they were strictly not allowing more than 7kgs of cabin baggage Despite mentioning that the cargo luggage had delicate souvenirs which couldn t be taken in carry on they did not handle the baggage properly and it resulted in all of them breaking and this was an issue with the airline and not us so we remained at our seats Other passengers had the same issue and it must have taken a good 30 minutes to have this dealt with When we arrived in Delhi 3 of our 4 luggage had the priority label but the fourth did not so we had to wait for about 15 minutesThere were 2 air stewards on board apparently however aside from take off and off boarding they were not present at all Today when I took the Spicejet flight to Hyderabad from Visakhapatnam with the same baggage while issuing a boarding passBy the grace of Almighty the staffs at the boarding counter guided me to the boarding gates and helped me catch my flight I had to travel to Chennai from Mumbai the flight was at 10 30 pm and the flight boarding started late smooth baggage was a little delayed leg space seating ok take only aisle seat Boarding was done before the time printed on boarding gate with out any announcement intimation hence people were confused Other passengers had the same issue and it must have taken a good 30 minutes to have this dealt with When we arrived in Delhi 3 of our 4 luggage had the priority label but the fourth did not so we had to wait for about 15 minutesHand baggage was checked just before boarding and not at the time of check in thereby denying opportunity to reduce hand baggage i don t understand spice jet using a same aircraft for passengers and baggages And for a cross border flight which would cut out one s overnight hotel stay short red eye flights which then require your attention to pass immigration and baggage and locate transportation into the city are not for the faint of heart the price was rather competitive They started shouting anout last call ever before the boarding time written onAnd the luggage arrived as it should I have experience of 2 3 times while airline staff is polite on this and giving that incoming airline arrival late leads to dalay in departure of Pune Flight You are charged from seat selection to everything and more be prepared to shell out surprise charges on baggage food terribly smelly and dirty seats 14kg my friedns didnt have much in his hand luggage sameTalking of boarding experience staff has no info on when the boarding would start and boarding never commence on time mentioned on the boarding pass My checked in baggage was much lesser than the allowance There is no Priority boarding allowance the check in person in Cochin said they cant consider hand luggage allowance we decided to repack and re scan the cases However beware of hand luggage you are carrying Unlike some other airlines you did get on first and your luggage was waiting us in the arrivals hall While we were coming back the luggage stats for the same were 27KG and 13 KG respectively This Girl Spicejet Ground Staff at Kochi Airport Mariya put us into the over weight luggage penalty zone This was the only concern for the person at the checkin desk who did not ask about the content of our bags at all delayed departure unable web check in chaos at check in counter staff not courteous delayed departure as well arrival no proper communication on thisAs per regulation valuables u cannot keep in checking baggage When I explained to her that I had travelled with the same luggage without any issue earlier she called one Mr Akhil They changed Boarding Gate also without any announcementBasically it was my mistake in overlooking the legends in small letters Hand baggage Only at the time of Booking And they had now 5 but with baggage only fare it did not make any sense for usAll passengers had to weigh their hand luggage which is restricted to 7Kg which caused the congestion I mean I woke up at 7 30am prior a day of light to web checkin the only option for the web check in seats were all middle seats no windows nor aisle seats available most of them were asked to pay 150 or 200 rupees extra or you need to be present at the counter to get your seat The Fat Lady issuing did not bothered listening to me that check in baggage was fragile Prompt at the check in counter as also in luggage checking Probably the aircraft arrived late but the staff made it ready to fly on time in quick time Our checked in baggage was tampered with valuable jackets expensive perfumes chocolates were stolen We were 4 passengers traveling together despite our best efforts we couldn t get seats together neither through web check in nor through airport check in Infact this was the first time I got to know of a provision of no check in baggage Despite pre booking 10kg excess weight the absence of hand baggage was not adjusted for calculating extra weight smooth web checkin and luggage deposit seats were without window so a bit suffocating else a nice experienceSo thing is that I have never seen any section where it s mentioned that you have to select any thing for your luggage in any mobile application while booking a ticket andhe could not find my ticket My wife entered but could not check in as she was with the trolley with luggage which would have been considered excess the officer could not help as they were busy and thought its our problem and were left to fend I went to the ticket counter and gave my name and mobile numberAnd most careless thing about this airline they don t care about passenger baggage The lowest fare is usually a hand baggage only fare which will not be mentioned on the travel website So its better to select your seats during normal web checkin where you don t have to spend as much No staff to help and advise from which belt to collect luggage Ground staff at the boarding gate in Delhi lacked basic CS skills and a robot could have done a better job Well the harassment started from the checkin itself and continued till we deplaned Neither any announcement nor any display regarding boarding in aircraft was made even just before 30 minutes of scheduled departure and this has created an air of confusion among the waiting passengers I requested her to have a look at my co traveler age 76 years and I showed her hand baggage containing ticket print out n medicines only and explained to her that she prefers to not carrying any weight on hand and therefore the check in bag got a bit heavier We had 4 seats reserved and the luggage area above our seats should be given to usNo one was available at the boarding gate to answer While DE Boarding to my surprise I saw stacks of newspapers lying in the over head bin which I was told that it wasn t available When asked to help with the luggage they preferred to just get lost in the crowd and asked for the second time to another person this time female rupess for a check in baggage I paid it via my debit card the airline staff charged me extra which was a mistake made by their side But additional details mentioned like Priority checkin priority check out and priority boarding are just false It was surprising that during check in they don t inform passenger that your final hand baggage weight will be done at the time of on board With great difficulty they managed to disembark from the aircraft with their cabin baggage and board the bus on the tarmac again without any assistance whatsoever We were travelling on a group booking with 11 people and at checkin the combined total of the baggage was 6 kg over the limit 165kg for 6 Pax 15kg per Pax Travelled recently from Kolkata to Mumbai and back to Kolkata from Mumbai under Hand Baggage only Fare Type I was not carrying any hand luggage with me The departure Gate changed there were no announcements everyone struggled to get their cabin baggage in place some hid theirs under their seats despite orders to the contrary This budget airline may not be the best choice for the international traveler tourist because of their baggage policy Received sms to warn flight was hand luggage only We had two hand luggage one of them was an electronic item called the flight attendent Mr Sanjay told him that this area belongs to us and we have to keep our luggage to my surpriseBaggage services were good and all in all we had a trouble free experience with this airline Day before yesterday I flew from Hyderabad to Vizag hassle free by Indigo with two hand luggages without any check in baggage It was horrible at the time of off boarding No staff was present at the boarding gate for any kind of help BUT when I reached the airport to check in my luggage and their staff gives me the worst news I was in queue for more than 4 hours my bags were checked in and then Etihad representatives realized that the flight was overbooked and I along with 20 people were denied boarding and asked to come back later during the day Why were we denied boarding when we had boarding passes with us we pulled out our luggage and we fixed the weight they allowed us for and left with hug disappointing service we have faced then they lost my luggage We had actually had our luggage weighed and our boarding passes issued when we were told we had no tickets and would not be able to board unless we bought another ticket So WHY oh why Etihad did you take it off me and everyone else at the boarding gate Abu Dhabi Melbourne 1500 SAR money was stolen from my checkin bag They must literally throw the bags I ve never had anything like this with our luggageThe airport staff at Zurich had the audacity to snatch the hand baggage which was as per the airlines weight and dimension specs from my 15 year old daughter and forcing her to check it in I had a very horrible and nasty experience with the staffs in the check in and luggage area in Heathrow airport From checkin to food and also the rude crew all were an issue My entire vacation has been ruined because somebody who was paid to do their job was negligent enough to mishandle my baggage 4 or 5 Etihad employees searched the baggage and an extremely rude aggressive person was selecting some passengers from the lines to search I was one my baggage was badly damagedPlease do help us in getting the refund since it was the rude behaviour of the airport staff at the checking as we were ready to pay for the excess luggage that made us to miss the flight In the middle of their cruel and harassing attitude my husband got the luggage tags for both the carry on Because we couldnâ t find anyone there and the sticker police tero was also damage and coming off the luggage my husband did not want to drag the ugly luggageAbuDhabi the check in counter personnel were busy playing a game on their cellphone totally nonchalant that there were passengers waiting to check in the worst part is that they were incapable to check us all the way to Queenstown and instead of investigating the cause they just issued us the boarding passes to AbuDhabi and told us that the rest of the boarding passes will be issued to us upon arrival to AbuDhabi by the transit counter and they are ridiculous culously strict on hand luggage but it turns out that Eithad has the world most expensive baggage fees I queried so many airline s about the baggage cost i paid and they all said it was a rip off they definitely over charged They lost my baggage Taipei London then lost my baggage London Taipei Our baggage was first lost and then delivered badly damaged Their customer service is terrible and damaged baggage is not replaced I was forced to empty my check in bag and dump everything into my hand baggage We waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for our baggage to be retrieved from the planes locked baggage doors while stuck at the baggage carousels in Melbourne airport Extra baggage allowance is paid by the kilo and is expensive when compared to BA where you pay for another bag 23KG They both of fail to refund my 3 airline tickets even though I provided evidence The trouble started at T2 in Mumbai itself as the staff of the Airline came very late to issue boarding passes Luggage lost with poor communication and rude and unhelpful customer support The entire baggage was smashed in I was told at Mumbai airport by baggage staff that my other bag was delayed and stuck at Abu Dhabi airportBaggage reclaim at Heathrow for Frist Class passengers was appalling Etihad need to sort this out We arrived at the check in desk for flight EY 454 to have our carryon luggage searched by Etihad Staff not police as it has been suggested and all duty free removed and placed into a box and told by the Etihad staff this would be brought to our seat on the plane For straight two hours me and my husband were standing there and showing them that the luggage do fit the designated box or else why would they give us the tags at the first place My baggage is damaged and cannot be used anymore After getting our luggages we were shoved out of the airport coz of an emergency I feel really disappointed that the baggage claim is still not settled 5 months after my flight Dec12th 9 50pm Seat 64K Checkin experience was the worst with Dnata Flight began bad as it took one hour and 27 minutes to drop off baggage at Hong Kong airport with flight to Abu Dhabi quite normal for economy Very smooth check in although baggage allowance is poor only 23kg Poor is baggage claim But the luggage handling is the worst in the world After waiting to complete forms at Lost Luggage desk for over an hour I was informed my bag was in Sydney Australia would arrive on the next flight I was denied for boarding as Etihad denied to transfer my one small bag to onward flight at another carrier When we were dropping the baggage in Bangalore Airport weâ Checkin at heathrow ws too slow which was unbearable In Frankfurt we realised that the baggage was damaged Then why the hell they mentioned they offer 2 baggage for the customers to from US I received my checked in baggage at Sydney airport only to find it had been ransacked and several items stolen and missing Without thinking or without asking any one he tore out the baggage slip and called me at the side of the counter and asked about my origin and race Why in the hell should my family call American Airlines to rebook the remaining journey when the flight ticket was issued by Etihad I called Madrid lost baggage repeatedly no answer despite their office hours being 8am 10pm Really poor experience lost luggage terrible food dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper on all flights and a reluctance from the crew to fill up my water bottle after being advised that I could not take a full water bottle on in Abu Dhabi and there being no water facilities in the departure lounge I was charged for extra baggage which was not there in the first place As Etihad uses only one bridge for boarding the process was quite underwhelming and also defeated the priority boarding as you ended up in the economy line trampling through the business section Our bags took more than an hour after landing to arrive in the baggage collection area soaking wet I have been told by the Etihad people that we have not loaded your luggage and you need to wait hopefully maximum by tomorrowA little disappointed that we could not check our baggage earlier Pointless as you have been through it in your departure airport security once you get off the planeAfter checking in the luggage and complaining to Mr Walled the supervisor was even surprised me asking questions When your luggage gets lost on the way that s bad for your business and their business at Business Class prices It has been 30 days since I have landed and despite multiple attempts of contact by phone and email MY LUGGAGE IS STILL LOST The handling of baggage by Etihad airways is very poor the ground service were ok except for the boarding at the gates they were very slow and didnt giveâ When I received my bag on Paris Airport it was badly damaged and I had approached baggage counter at Paris Airport they did not repairAhmedavad airport staff gave me more headache at the boarding time On top of this 20 hours travel trauma my bag is missed and no trace of it for 3 days and I was keep calling them for and no one called me even after 72 hours of filing a missing baggage claim Now they charge you for preassigned seat for any checked in luggage and their inflight service is extremely poor Delayed boarding at Sydney airport with staff asking us if we were willing to fly the next night instead due to overbooked plane Pre booked childâ s meal missing and â not registeredâ on first two flights reported both times Around 5 staff members led by one boss openly fighting on the open floor with each other Child screaming nearby for 14 total hours all good with meI was very unhappy with the compensation as its basically useless for me since I don t have excess baggage nor will I have holiday planned in the next 12 months Both luggages opened with damage to locks All our luggage was badly damaged on the trip over and also the trip back every flight had a delay and the baggage was not delivered to the final destinationFrustrating they do not listen and now they have lost my luggage They should outsource the customer service for luggage in Italy as the service in Milan is terrible NOBODY KNOWS NOTHING is just ridiculous when you pay a ticket of 6 000 Euros with Qatar when my luggage was delayMy luggage got lost while I was traveling to Riyadh they recovered it 48hrs later and delivered to me broken open and without the slider zippers I provide all the necessary documents and photos to proof my case but they never accept the damage on my luggage and I have several expensive items missing from my Checked in Baggage Tried calling them no customer care for damaged baggage claims Finally when there is such a delay the airline should either try to delay boardingThey gave me 2 options either pay 350 for this carry on luggage or not travel in which case my ticket would go waste After several attempts for 25 minutes we had no choice but to try and get a last minute taxi to get us to the airport which resulted in us being late and just about made boarding resulting in no use of the lounge which is part of what you pay for when you fly business My wife and I travelled to Abu Dhabi and when we collected our baggage the wheels were broken off on both cases with substantial damage to one of them On a half empty flight Two hours flight delayed I had to pay 300 for a flight cancellation and rebook my ticket and get it off tomorrow Expedia instead Zero baggage issues zero delays flight from Syndey Abu Dhabi to Rome was relatively underbooked and so were encouraged by airline stewards to enjoy some extra room and spread out across any empty rows plenty of in flight entertainment decent onboard toilets That being said her portable mobility scooter which has greatly aided her mobility and which she has used in all her travels abroad for the last five years had been damaged beyond repair during baggage transport upon her arrival at Frankfurt Airport So people that hadn t paid for baggage email said they didn t have baggage allowance One Cabin luggage was refused informing that it was too large although it was not over weight The flight was delayed for 4 hours and the item was stolen from the passengers check in baggage My girlfriend and I were flying the London Kuala Lumpur route via Abu Dhabi when we experienced some of the rudest unattentive service we ve had on top of missing baggage that has led to us nearly having a failed wedding I flew from abu dhabi to toronto to discover my baggage arrived damaged beyond repair I was told to just head straight to the gate where my boarding card would be as I arrived at the gate which was boarding my card was ready and waiting My luggage damaged on first leg of flight Please be warned etihad now also has â lowâ fares that do not allow u to check in luggage only hand carrry There was a 1 hour connection in Munich MUC and one of our luggage was missed that time I made a claim for baggage damages and I received an email back stating it takes 21 calendar day to process I had booked my meal with my flight booking requesting a low fat option however did not receive this at any meal Despite Etihad knowing our luggage had not made the Abu Dhabi connection we were left waiting for our priority bags at the carousel until all other passengersâ We got in a crush of passengers all trying to get through passport control then baggage collection When I tried to buy my excess baggage I did not get a discount because I supposedly missed my 48 hours Luggage lost worst airline ever been on flights were delayed lost luggage no compensation just wasting my time with emails if you hate someone book them on etihadThat would still mean us waiting over 14 hours at the airport given that checkout is 12 noon They provided a tracking link that doesn t work so I am unable to track my luggage They lost my luggage and never cared Fair bit of disorganisation flight delayed 12 hours a pain to start with but then we were told it was cancelled and to find accom in Abu Dhabi then back on again Only downside is this airline charges for each seat selection which is a bit sad as for normal economy seats there is no need do it but again it s their way of getting some extra revenue They forced me to buy a new ticket and pay for my baggage as the baggageâ s from Abu Dhabi was less then what I was allowed I arrived at Mumbai to see an airport staff not the Etihad staff waiting for me he said he has no boardingit seems to me that is a low cost company gestion who make money with luggages extra weight Once past the security check then the boarding gate itself has two separate lines for economy andâ However our real problems only began when our delayed flight arrived at Abu Dhabi and we were informed that we now had to fly via Bangkok as our flight to Phuket had been cancelled Got my baggage back really quickly Our luggage is at the moment lost Finnaly arrived after 50 hours in Munich also my luggage got lost Only pity was that our luggage couldn t catch up our next flight maybe transit timeDon t fly with Etihad overbooked flights lost luggage and no compensation On 30th September I was booked on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Madrid At Beijing Airport I waited for the luggage again for more than 45 minutes When i reached the door of the plane there were still 2 3 passengers waiting for their turn to get onto the plane This took a long time as they sorted through the baggage which was already on the plane On the way over the luggage was lost on the the return tripThe baggage claim was a messy affair but cant expect better from a busy Airport as LHR We received our baggage after a week but one of our baggage was damaged I was fortunate enough to come into contact with a young man named Narisu who insisted There was not enough time for me to get to the baggage claim area where the iPad had been located in the lost and found section The checkin is a nightmare with long queues and no order The double buggy had gone missing and now we would have to carry our kids along with our luggage out of the airport When we did Etihad final check in process 2 of our electronic boarding passes got problems I found my luggage was lost by Etihad In between 1 40pm to 2 30pm I urge you to check the CCTV camera of Gate C 30 the flight from Toronto Pearson to Abu Dhabi one of the Etihad representatives saw us going towards boarding the plane after final boarding pass check got our carry ons ripped off the luggage tags and then said pay for it They stopped me at the boarding and they said that they wanne check in my hand carrying bag for 350When I arrived Jakarta one of my luggage went missing I still removed some luggage when I went againWhen I made the booking no alert or indication was made that this type of booking was nil luggage allowance My husband baggage is missing and tried many times to contact Zurich staff but all in vain I got my luggage damaged during my trip to KUL in Aug 2019 Worst Airline every First they lost my luggage i got it back after 1 month later i made a claim for delayed baggage and they never respond to my email Sometimes web check in could not be completed most recently a flight booking with miles was interrupted Nice vegetarian food but Party spoiled when airlines missed my luggageA delay out of Abu Dhabi because of mislabeled luggage of over 90 minutes At least on this return trip we did not have to stand for over 2 hours at entry to US customs in ABU because ALL connecting luggage had been lost at the airport It all started with a flight cancellation due to bad weather fair enough sent email bu not reaching 1 of 4 baggage damaged worth 100 dollars my phoneThe boarding in Male was not well organizedWorst of all unlike other airlines they don t give you the child s stroller at the gate and both times we had to wait over 45 minutes at the over sized baggage belt for our stroller International flight was cancelled from Abu Dhabi so I rerouted through British Airways and they FAILED to reroute my luggage back to my final destination Again let me repeat the point that I do not have issue with the baggage delay and conveyer belt issue that happened but I have issue with how the airlines representatives mismanaged and handled the situatioun afterwards Meanwhile without checking another hostess a native of UAE started yelling at the passenger saying that if he didn t show her his boarding card she will call the security the overhead luggage is totally different as not a top hung opening it is opening from the bottomI contacted their baggage services and they said they would settle my claim We were flying form Ahmedabad to London and most of our baggage was damaged I send them a email with photos of our boarding pass along with a photos of our damaged bags My luggage was missing for five days and when I went to claim expensed for the inconvenience they are impossible to contact Once again we had luggage problems Flight delayed and was only told once waiting in the gate area eventually when boarding our pre booked seats which had been paid for were discounted and our boarding cards torn up we were given no explanation and told we had been allocated new seats with better leg room at theâ I had alot of anxiety there was missing my flight my connecting flight in Abu my luggage what am I gonna do on the flight for all those hours But now im currently sitting in the airport waiting and will have to stay here overnightThirdly while flying back from Mumbai to Toronto Etihad agent told me my hand luggage was exceeding the weight limit and I will have to pay Indian Rupee 6000 for extra weight or call someone who may have dropped me to airport to give extra weight to them First flight delay is their issue and on top of it they were NOT courteous Check in was very slow as all cases were double weighed the priority appeared to be catching people out on baggage weight as I had 30 kgWhile it is normal to have some wear and tear to the luggage I was surprised to find that the whole extending handle was broken ripped off on 1 of my suitcases that too a sturdy Samsonite hard topâ We raised the Missing baggage Claim and no one informed us about the status at all And last but not least my luggage was lost in transit and sent to Thailand instead of Hanoi which left me without clothes for 2 whole days very disappointing especially considering it was our Honeymoon I had eaten very little before boarding but 2 hours into the flightPriority luggage is a joke a few random bags then all the staff luggage came off the belt our bags came off 3 4 of the way thru the baggage arrival I ended up giving my boarding pass back as no good only one of us getting home and wife stuck in Abu Dhabi with no ticket or luggage so I went a day without my luggage Then once inside the aircraft the ground staff started taking away the large carry on luggage which should have been done before people could on board Coming home flights were on time but my baggage went missing for 2 days in Abu Dharbi Flight delayed leaving Paris had to move very quickly to Gate to make interconnecting flight to Brisbane Is there any verification done for such associate who is handling guest luggage and stealing items without any hesitation Delayed Flight They made me pay for excess baggage 317 Euros which was nowhere mentioned on their websites Jet and Etihad Etihad lost my luggage in October 2018 and did not admit or acknowledge it until January 2019 they are required to do so after 21 days 3 days b4 i get to the airport i called Ethihad and asked the consultant about the extra baggage as i wanted to purchase extra baggage online I booked a flight with checked bags only to get to the airport and be told I had no baggage allowance My biggest disappointment was with Abu Dhabi airport and the long bus transfers from plane to terminal and back and the security check melee oin arrival not well organised at all Our luggages more illegal than us because the luggages were already checked in through Jakarta from Paris I barely managed to get my connect flight and the airline failed to deliver my baggage to the connecting flight He said that I am not allowed to check in my baggage and I am allowed only hand baggage My luggage was lost in both the legs of my Journey On that day baggage unloading took more than three hours and as result we missed the connecting flight We arrived in Brisbane to find our luggage did not make the connecting flight which was very disappointing after readingâ After a few minutes an announcement was made that we would have to wait until his baggage was removed Their customer service is slow and they ask for baggage receipts you purchased way back in time as an excuse not to settle the claim Most probably will miss next transit due to amsterdam via klm because of your delayed flight We had delayed flights Athens Abu Dabhi Online checkin is also a nightmare on top of 3 hours flight delay which was on top of 5 hours transit First their ground staff damage your luggage and later their baggageâ These boarding passes clearly stated the gate closes 15 minutes prior not 45 so we likely could have made our original flight Shambolic customs in Abu Dhabi ground staff unhelpful etc which is apparent if there are problems like flight delays BC luggage arrived on the carousel long after economy passengers picked up and left the airport Baggage arrived late and damaged we just run carrying our full trolley of luggage and tired babyThe boarding was chaotic and everyone scrambling to put their luggage which they could not However I found it very unprofessional for the ground staff to keep passengers lined up at the gate for 2hrs before notifying them of the flight cancellation They know that people will not leave their luggage behind and would pay for itOn boarding I handed our boarding passes to a Stewardess who scared my son no easy task with her strict principal ish tone and her eyes popping out asking him to stay put while she checked our boarding passes both flights delayed never again Etihad My wife and I had to explain the baggage allowances to the staff member and indeed his supervisor The checkin at Heathrow T4 was not opened on time due to 3 â suitsâ who seemed to be full of their own importance At Sydney airport at least 20 passengers waiting to check in at the business class section one operator attending to a passenger with lots of problems It has been 2 weeks since I arrived and reported the delay of my baggage to Etihad delayed baggage counter and still have not gotten any significant progress report but I want to try of connection at Abu Dabhi only to find that there is a missing baggage you never get any problems with luggage Not only was I lied to about my ticket including baggageWhat astonishes me is that the Etihad staffs at T1 3 have deliberately lied to me about the boarding passes for Mumbai to Bangalore as I found out that another passenger was given the boarding pass for these same flights at Abudhabi itself Now comes not so good parts boarding was really disorganised in NY 5 My baggage was damaged and I followed all the correct process reporting it while still in Airport Etihad staff too started initially tagging passenger luggage for putting them in luggage hold but after initial 5 6 they stopped for reason best known to them itâ s a pushed for time as return boarding cards are no longer issued at Abu Dhabi the time frame for getting through transfers to collect the return boarding card is tight firstly during checkin it was long queue and had to wait close to 1 5 hours to reach the counter the process was slow due to systemI lost my baggage when I was travelling from Bangalore to Chicago on 23 24 th Aug When asked to explain the reason for the extra charge the reason given is that the 3 hand bags check in by American Airlines will NOW incur an extra baggage charge by weight and the total extra cost is 1640 Euros It was a shock for us when the Etihad check in desk executive told us during the baggage drop there wont be any TV available in the whole flight This is NOT the same on some other leading airliines other companies which I won t name make you feel like they wish you hadn t bothered to use their airline and you are just another piece of baggage but not Etihad the contrast is astounding Iâ ve even tried to phone Baggage services at JFK they said I have to speak to Etihad We were delayed for nearly 2 hours due to a family having to be offloaded and their luggage located we were regularly updated toilets available and throats lubricated But wherever i asked they were just talking negative like you will have to pay extra for your baggage we will not let you allow to throw things from your baggage if anybody going to usaIf you think this doesn t sound bad 6 other families on our same flight experienced the same left baggage issue They require you to go through US customs in the UAE before boarding which often slows down you boarding the plane by up to three hours at times The agents involved appear ill informed simply relayed the same information posted on the world tracer website failed to listen when we attempted to convey the baggage had been located an what was shared previously My baggage was found damaged when I reach Singapore side top frame badly cracked I was told they had to go because my laptop bag is supposed to be included with my cabin baggage we never experienced luggage damage before with other airlines however we got to cairo and found that our luggage got damaged we tried to find someone for thisThe website said that I could get a 20 discount if I bought my excess baggage 48 hours before my FLIGHT I don t understand how they allow ladies their huge handbags cabin luggage Could not check my baggage for the Final Destination or get boarding passes for going flights I got delayed flight delayed luggage and delayed bus because of so much delays I can t able to catch up the timing of the bus one of our baggage did not come with the others and we got it only in the next flight We were then informed that we would have to wait because checkin had not opened We arrived in Manchester on time with no baggage missing or damaged If you plan to fly with them take flight delays into consideration We Missed our connecting flights due to the Flight delay from Amsterdam then he reluctantly came along but at least he handed me over to other colleagues of his till taking my luggage out and showing me the AirIndia counter Out of 200 times I called only twice my calls were answered one by the Vanesa and other by Fletcher again they have no clue about the luggage and given me the wrong commitments that we will come back to you soon nothing as of now no surprise from Etihad attitude this is normal from them It is advisable to carry the no bags and buy clothes at the destination rather than paying these airlines for extra baggage asked them to checkin they refused and asked for 300 for sending the hand luggage with other bags When we got to baggage claim we were given no help as there was no Etihad staff in sight But the real problem was when we reached LAX first our baggage had been switched to another terminal for delivery â Boarding was haphazard at AbuDhabi both the times butâ Charged an extortionate Â 251 00 for 7kg over the baggage limit which was rounded up to 10kg We had to queue for check in at the gate in Frankfurt while the boarding was already in progress When we were going towards the boarding gates an officer was rushing us from time to time saying that flight was about to leaveThe boarding process was lacking any priority boarding at that gate which was not normal in the past When I reached the airport they said my offer did not have two baggage allowance Would rather suggest booking Jazeera or Air Arabia at least for the cost of their ticket they allow u to add baggage for a minimal sum Luggage was waiting for us even after fast track tickets through immigration they denied the possibility and now I was told I have to take my luggage out in Mumbai and again check in after getting the boarding pass a lady said you will get an extra baggage and wait for the updated ticket for 2 days but no updates When she immediately informed the baggage claim representative she was dumbfounded at the audacity of one of your male personnel to even blame her for not placing her mobility scooter in a box for safe keeping during transport not realizing that my aunt needs it to get in and out of the airport None of there customer service agents respond to your baggage claim After 40 minutes of waiting i go to him again and he still ask me waiting even the boarding time has passed Even if you call their baggage department Availability is not throughout the day they don t answer This had caused serious inconvenience and this needs to be clearly flashed prior doing the payment so that customer will sure be aware that the ticket has Nil luggage Weâ ve had delayed bags flights before with Korean Airlines and the reason why we will be going back to them rather than trying Etihad again is because of the tremendous customer service they provided when dealing with these issues the lady exclaimed and told me please fix your luggage Managef to board on time altjough a littls hectic with having to go through personal baggage security again Flight delay is alright but handling the passengers was very very bad Other airlines like Emirates have policy of putting extra luggage in luggage hold and anyone carry more than the permitted weight is charged He refused to anymore questions from me regarding what happens next baggage etc until a federal officer asked him what happened and he accidentally said the ticked was overbooked But when we reached Chicago we did not receive that baggage and claimed We need to drive from Chicago to Columbus My baggage is mishandled it is damaged Very sad and horrible experience with airhostesses I am a student who wanted to issue extra baggage allowance and booked ticket through call center later to find that extra baggage wasn t been added in ticket and was misinformed by the India call center Etihad left mine and 8 other passengerâ s luggage in Abu Dhabi when we flew into Madrid took two hours at the airport to report it a day to locate it another day to send it to Madrid got a call saying it would be delivered the next day and that my only option was to spend a day of my holiday waiting at the house from 8am 6pm and that the driver would call us Finally we are told there will be a delay while their luggage is off loaded It was very hard for me to carry my heavy baggage without wheels till my hotel When we reached our final destination our luggage were delayed and without an extra clothing we had spend our vacation for a days also we bought some gifts for our families which was really inconvenient and we were group of 4 friends and at the time of check in all were given different seats as did a mistake of coming to the airport for a late checkin Had slight problem with online checkin when trying to change seat position which was resolved by check in staff ground staff in abudhabi are not great and boarding is chaotic I cannot believe they charge almost ten times extra than other airlines for extra luggage Baggage in Manila was delayed but swift in the end Dirty toilets even when used on first boarding To top my experience off on arrival my bags had been sent to the connecting flights baggage claim by the incompetent check in assistant in Manchester They said that we were a no show my wife mentioned that stand by staff ticket passengers go on last minute 10 15 minutes before take off and there was a moment of hesitation and the ground staff asked if we were staff I do hope the baggage door was fixed Flight boarding and take off were on time and landed at Abu Dhabi 15 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time Travelling with a friend the nightmare began when no boarding passes for on going flight from Abu Dhabi were provided On the baggage issue we were flying to KUL to attend my girlfriend s sister s wedding within 2 days of arrival when we had the bag with all our wedding clothing and materials missing we were also organisers The flight started well champagne and nuts served on boarding and my dinner menu taken that was the end of any service for the next 3 5 hours no offer of any drinks water and no sign of any food We changed dollars to pay for the ticket but had to scramble again to change more dollars for the excess baggage charge Now when I eventually boarded the flight Gate check in staff moved my seat to an area without extra leg room I wanted to recheck in my baggage in AMS i didn t want to collect the bags directly at KEF as i want to stuff more luggage in AMS We were required to collect boarding passes before boarding the third plane and the ground staff were reluctant to issue them 40 mins before take off Noting that they they never showed us the luggage that we we allegedly had Their online baggage service tells us they have stopped recording this matter My luggage was wrongly sent to America and there was no compensation or acknowledgement from Etihad at all And whatâ s more my aunt was made to take the regular queue in your CDG Paris counter while sitting on a baggage cart because she a person with disability was not provided a wheelchair and considered a priority So many hand luggage problems For economy class you get to select the seat 48 hours before the flight during checkin The gentleman at the baggage counter allowed me to choose one from their storage room where lost baggage was being held I had heard so much about how good this airline was WRONG service was terrible food average and the experience at checkin especially at JFK was not good They asked me to reshuffle in the last couple of minutes for the remaining 3 cabin luggages to be exactly 7 each Every year I experience issues with baggage either missing or damaged but this year Etihad went a step aheadFlights were both on time and luggage arrived without damage Food was disgusting and not as described by the attendants and airline expected passengers to pay for snacks Bad customer service unorganized luggage claims inefficient crew n raised my voice to say even i was a paid passenger and had solved the baggage weight issue so if he could plz issue my boarding pass we went directly to the transit counter the gentleman there told us simply that he couldn t issue the boarding passes as the flight was still closed and that we needed to come back after 6 hrs to have our boarding passes we went exactly 6 hrs after and a good 3 hrs before the flight to the transit counter where the gentleman there told us that the system could not issue the boarding passes because it requires us to have visas to Australia since we are transiting there visasCheck in and boarding was ok nothing special After waiting for their luggage and getting increasingly dismayed when it didnâ t come they were finally informed of what had happened There was also a delay in luggage delivery caused by short time between flights so we got our luggage later that day Only to come back to South Africa and see that all our luggage was broken fabric on bags was ripped and the whole wheel and pull handle cracked in half The flight was OK although there were a lot of issues handling my luggage so they wanted me to place in the hold obviously making me pay for excess baggage for 10kg 800gm Their robotic and unfriendly attitude was disappointing and irritating I did the E ticket check in at the airport check in machine and went to the E ticket line but had to wait very long behind people who did not have E tickets already To cut a long story short I eventually met a lady called kelly and a man called Oscar at baggage service in domestic where we were sent at midnight to collect our bags ourselves who were superb afb sorted everything out to the best of their ability If you have a long layover which I had not directly booked via Etihad it became an isssue as I had to wait outside checkin counters for a long time I was asked to Remove 1 kg from my cabin baggage and add it to my checked baggage which was then somehow 3 kgs over the allowed limit 1 5 kg in one piece and 1 5 kg in the other piece and was then charged 175 for this Added bonus on all etihad flights it is now forbidden to carry coconut oil on either hand luggage or checked in luggage Before the flight I got shafted by a member of the check in crew who charged me 270 Euro for luggage overweight and no negotiating or reasoning possible even though Iâ and they gave me baggage claim form and told me to apply for baggage claim through online I was escorted down to baggage through numerous security and immigration kiosks where every time he told them very indiscreetly I had been removed from a flight From check to cabin crew to my lost luggage on the return flight the Etihad staff were ranging from surly to downright rude The Airport in Dubai is one where after you ve walked to gates with numbers like 53 you have to wait to board a bus to get on your plane and carry your hand luggage up the portable steps Upon arrival in Dublin we found out that one of our items of baggage had been lost First of all the airline has to be aware of this from the very beginning so instead of making the passengers wait at the belt for their luggage the right thing to be done should be that the passengers are immediately informed of such a happening in the flight itself so that they are well prepared A strategic repack and carrying on a lot more hand luggage helped us avoid a GBP150 surcharge PS at the checkin counter it took around 30 minutes to drop the luggage in a small airport with little crowd This was not the first time I have heard of Etihad s baggage issues 3 of my friends have had this on 3 separate occasions and though not necessarily the fault of the airline the consistent risk of missing baggage when flying with EtihadWe were also told that we could not stand at the counter and had to stand no closer than the signs indicating the commencement checkin queue We needed to bring back an extra suitcase but even trying to prepay months in advance it would have cost 940 AU for 23 kg At check in they weighed all of our belongings including all carry on items so they could charge every last dollar for excess luggagecheck in took forever even though we had already checked in on line and had boarding passes all a waste of time boarding has started there was no assistance on the ground nothing at all I had to run all the way go through security clearanceif you buy the cheapest ticket online the seating is a problem especially if you travelling with your family you can be separated and the answer from checkin desk is sorry we cant helpThey don t have 24x7 staffed baggage helpline number 2 On arrival in Paris I did not have enough time to catch the connecting flight to Madrid which had left ten minutes before I reached the boarding gate Upon arrival at Phuket 3 hours late all the London passengers found their luggage had gone astray so another 40 minutes filling out forms I had travelled with emirates with an even shorter transit time with no issues of luggage We then had to wait at the boarding gate until all Etihad ticket holders had been processed Boarding was on time and there were no queues Also they said nothing in spite of me having 3 kg extra baggage i wait till 11 am of the day after for the boarding from the boarding to the final destinationI had never paid so much for taking an extra suitcase until I flew with Etihad At Athens on our way home we are told we cannot get 3 of the boardingI dropped around 20kg from my checking in and agreed to pay for one cabin luggageNo separate line for business economy at security check prior to gate boarding area and only 1 person checking passports Chaotic check in inconsistent inflight service and discrepancy between baggage policy and baggage implementation When I disagreed as this is the first time my laptop was included I was told they will not give me my boarding passes i Know why i cant able to checkin The staff were not helpful with storing baggage or making sure our stuff was close to usAirline check in staff were extremely rude I was informed I have to check in my luggage or leave it at least you feel comfy to sit for a long haul flight food is fine and not too bland Upon arriving at baggage drop 1 5 hours before departure I was informed that Etihad had overbooked the flight and was offered a â 400â Their baggage department is the most worst department among the top world class airlines and it s accepted on BA Emirates Virgin causing me to check in the bag resulting in my baggage being 7kg over the limit So if you don t want to deal with airline staff lying to your face DO NOT FLY ETIHAD especially if you have young babies as they simply believe that you could play with them for 14 hours on an overnight long haul flight He said he cannot issue us the boarding passes since the system Auto locks their issuance I asked why then did Etihad let us board in Jeddah and why even your colleague the night before did not tell us that and made us wait 6 hrs he advised us there is nothing he can doShe then told me I had too much baggageBaggage restriction is a drawbackMy luggage was not transferred to my flight which I had to book myself in timeI paid to select my seat although it s free to choose if you wait until 24 hours before the flight departure A few hiccups with third party checkin at Hing Kong and security of baggage on board but the latter appears to have been sorted out We also found out that some couples had sat next to each other after checking in a mere hour before the flights departure Now waiting to board and all I see around me is bigger carry on luggages When we arrived back in Sydney his wheelchair was not at the plane to meet him as we had previously organised we even discussed with the crew during the flight to ensure the chic would be at the door of the plane the chair had been sent to oversized baggage so again not good enough But students aren t allowed a laptop bag in addition to a cabin luggage He had printed my boarding pass and baggage claim sticker No one is able to provide me an update and is still unable to locate my luggage At checkin inform the PAX that the flight is busy and issue a middle seat b These guys did not allow even 10 gms extra weight in checkin baggage and very roude to customers Apart from that I had issues with all legs of our journey to India and back including flight cancellations and changes Three weeks before departure tickets arrived only instead of direct flight to UAEOnly issue was the restrictions on size of cabin baggage as Etihad are very strict and sizing is less than other carriers so be aware to checkAll this while we were getting late for boarding and had 3 of our check in bags 5 kilos under weight They don t allow the cabin baggage to be separate from your laptop bag 1 Delayed luggage by 2 days in Delhi I was hoping if anyone from Etihad customer service department can assist me in this as the baggage claim department is unresponsive and hotline I called in Singapore are unable to assist me in this matter As a matter of fact I am flying to Japan on economy class ticket and my luggage allowance is 2 suitcases 30 kgs each On talking to our Travel Agent re The Shoddy flight baggage carriage he proceeded to tell me you are in the top 10 carriers but on looking up to show us the placing he discovered you have slipped to where is it 20 something Identified 4 extra luggage that was not ours We couldn t print off our boarding passes when checking it for the return leg and this did not cause any issue at all I have never before experienced this on any previous long haul flights certainly not on the outbound flight MEL Abu Dhabi on the 777 and I assume it had something to do with being forced to sit for prolonged periods and the pressure and temperature control in the cabin However the luggage allowances and flight times are an area begging improvement As a frequent flier over the past four decades I understand there are multiple challenges that impact flierâ s experience extreme weather unscheduled maintenance unexpected delays and of course mishandled baggage In the end I requested my luggage bought a ticket to Dubai from Emirates had to go through the entire process again as I was going to my new gate I passed by the gate for the Etihad flight and people there were still waiting for some information The airline knew that baggage had been transferred in Abu Dhabi and did not inform us We already finishes passing the checking of all the liquids not above 100 Before your boarding again they will check your liquids and we need to go out of the plane with all hour hand luggages Etihad has not delivered my luggage to Karachi First of all I was not able to get a discount on my excess baggage because there was a misunderstanding So effectively due to an Etihad issue our flight was changed and we got terrible seats and we arrived over 10h later and Etihad is utterly uncontactable regarding this so that we can claim neither from Etihad nor from our separately purchased travel insurance about the flight delay Aweful no concern about travellers delayed hot insides no priority boarding When we left in Manila we did not have our boarding passes from Abu Dhabi to Geneva The lost baggage desk informed us that the bags were in Abu Dhabi and given the itinerary of our trip and the contact details of the safari company promised that out bags would be delivered en route after 48 hours Please do not travel on this airlines the standard baggage size for hand luggage was not allowed I believe flight company do not have the power to simply change their passenger tickets without consent My brand new luggage was also damaged no premium luggage delivery upon arrival I have been astonished at the amount of carry on luggage other passengers have on board Air Hostess was not aware of this and politely told me that I am not supposed to carry two hand luggage I was really surprised from a reputed airlines like Etihad to issue tickets with Nil luggage After picking up our luggage straight thru from Perth we headed to the TVG station for our connection to Bordeaux The luggage handling was good as there was no delay in getting the luggage nor was there any damage to the suitcase At this price no other airline offers the same service so one will have to put up with the long layovers on long haul flights In flight They are very strict about baggage weight always as far as I have traveled Baggage handling has no problem at all and the movies on their in flight entertanment are the latest I did get an e mail from etihad advising me that we where on the 11 00 flight but no one told the checkin Only negative our luggage allowance was only 30kg when other airlines going to SaudiLastly on all flights excluding destinations in USA and South America baggage allowance has been reduced to one item only of max 20 kg with 40 Baggage fee for any extra kilo regardless of cabin or checked in luggage Again on the return flight we couldn t checkin before hand Luggage delivered quickly big mistake they add me 160 for my only lugggage 28kg on my fly back from bkk the luggage policy allowance on etihad is 23kg We were not given boarding passes That particular waiting lounge was very big catered for many different boarding gates ours gate 47 you really couldnâ t tell those sitting infront of the boarding gate are actually passengers of that gate When I checked in at Toronto airport Etihad agent told me my carry on luggage size is not acceptable I am frequent traveler and this is the same bag that I have been using with other airline for last 10 years as my carry on luggage Once arrived at Brisbane discovered my luggage was still in Abu Dhabi no compensation or apology But the worse of all is the lack of effective ground services checkin procedures for business class are not at par with other airlines First off boarding gates are not connected to the aircraft anymore therefore we have to take a bus with our 7kg hand carry baggage with us and climb the stairs of the aircraft along with it and we were very agitated to know that there had been some problem with the conveyer belt at the Abu Dhabi airport which had resulted in their luggage being held back there itself Absolutely no problems with our luggage Boarding was a catastrophe due to no shows and luggage retrieving Checkin experience was a nightmare due to the large tour groups milling pushing in line and not enough checkin desks for the volume of travellers It took another 30 minutes to check with them was too horrible Kids were crying and not walking but they told one more extra bad was checked out in my daughter name it was too bad without informing me and no tag they checked in my baggage On arrival in Milan my luggage had not arrived and I went through the steps to check in email and print boarding passes Met all my expectations and more from check in to boarding was seamless onboard service was on point i checked before the etihad website where the luggage allowance is not really clear they weighed our hand baggage at the gate and charged us 300 each for my family of 4 as all our cabin baggage was much below all world airline standard but 1 cm longer than Etihad s 50 cmâ and then the checkin clerk said he could not put us together as there were no seats this despite having small children that needed to be with their parents Luggage made it fine in spite of a short transfer on may home I landed On May 15 2018 and as always did not get my luggageWe were then demanded by a flight attendant to provide our boarding passes to ensure we were in the correct seats as another passenger had requested the row to themselves and was unhappy that we were there in our assigned seats When I received my luggage I realized they damaged it hardly Had disability in one hand your people present at the boarding counter didnâ t even had etiquettes to help Journey started with unexpected layover and missing baggage but still the help provided my the staffs was impressive After checking our baggage weight which was slightly higher he Ebin Thomas asked us to either pay the extra amount or to get rid of some weight This did not leave us much option to settle our additional baggage and having to pay for same additionally but my luggage arrived 4 days after my arrival and that too damaged we arrived 50 minutes before flight time I decided to go to the counter to try to check our luggage or buy myself a ticket for the following day while my family wife 3 year old and 1 year old went to passport control to attempt to get the flight where they realised I had the boarding passes on my phone Each passenger was carrying a large carry on suitcase and hence there was not enough space for everyone to place their luggage But according that Etihad is not offering it s baggage policy through any connecting flights through Europe countries No self service checkin kiosks are available for Etihad customers in Athens no mention that the cabin luggage was 7 and NOT 12 In NY the boarding counter opens only 3 hours in advance and surprisingly the lounge was not open even after the counter was open I found it very misleading of the agent to tell me to move the extra weight from my carry on luggage to my check in luggage and then charge me by upgrading bag weight to 32kg I wrote Etihad asking why there were no ground service staff to assist us considering the inconvenience of boarding deplaning with luggage And there was no luggage for me Website a glitch when i tried to book additional baggage and it was showing 200 USD For a round trip flight this meant SIX trips to from the aircraft on steep steps carrying our hand luggage To make the ordeal worse when they sealed the duty free stuff they placed my passport at the bottom of the bag and placed it on the conveyor belt for checked in luggage Still had a good holiday but for 8 days in the same clothes and all warm clothes in the lost luggage did make the safari somewhat uncomfortable but at least it was not a group venture that other people had to put up with it How can any other airline in the world let a Business Class passenger wait for luggage at the belt for more than an hour Instead they made me open up all my baggages with one hand and made me reshuffle a few grams of over weight luggage 0 4 kgs but these days all airlines have the same policy on baggage even on international travelThis is beyond a joke and disgusting to put trust in Eithad Airways to get my baggage safely to my destination intacted and with nothing stolen Etihad has been very indecisive about their luggage specifications these days Any airline that changes its luggage allowance rules and doesn t email guests to advise of this doesn t deserve our business I usually like and respect this airlines but today while checking in my Hays carry on luggage that I traveled all over with was not accepted on board so I had either to dispose it or to check it in While checking in we requested to check out baggage direct to Montreal but the counter staff advised it is not possible and checked the baggage only up to Toronto Their new baggage policy only covers you if you booked your ticket before the 31st Jan 2018 funnily enough this is very well hidden on their website This trip was to review the airline amount a portfolio of clients for our future trips Unlucky enough I arrive in Milan and my luggage is not there after calling every day for the past 3 weeks 18 days with no news or information about my luggage The boarding system from Dubai to Abu Dhabi International Airport is very organized and travel from Etihad Office Dubai to AUH international in Etihad s luxury buses do not let you feel any discomfort When we made it through immigration we finally found the counter to fill out the delayed luggage paperwork and after filling it out we were told â oh by the way you wonâ t make your next flight because you have to be there 45 minutes prior and itâ s in another terminal â The airlines does not add this to your allowable check in baggage After four days her baggage was located and scheduled to be returned to Abu Dhabi on 27 November 2018 and delivered the following day this did not happen Very strict with bagging allowance especially hand luggage Only downsides lounge in Johannesburg is OK from Abi Dhabi to Mumbai was on Jet Air boarding no first class transfers between connected flights no first class priority passport check or first class lounge makes it no differenceâ During boarding they packed as many people standing as possible in the bus before shuttling off to the airplane parked somewhere else So out of the queue repack all into 2 bags put on bulky clothes Stuff presents into carry on luggage get back in the queue with 2x20kg and one empty 2kg On boarding i noticed there were 5x empty â premiumâ seats 3 rows in front of me To make the story short now after many months of this trip the best way if a passenger experience a excess baggage is to open your baggage and see what you really don t need in my case now thinking back I did not need bunch of stuff in my baggage that I could of thrown them away and avoided the charge such as shampoo after shave body wash soup etc Airline officials then arrived and ordered everyone out of the lounge to line up for a physical inspection of all carry on baggage requiring passengers to open their bags for inspection Departure gate lounge was chaos with no advice as to delay and all guest boarded same time On our return flight when departing Abu Dhabi after going through all the normal security screening and checks we were siting in the boarding area when we were all herded into lines with no communication what so ever to have our hand luggage searched again can you imagine a passenger travelling from Mumbai to Moscow only with her passport without any money documents or any cabin bag only because your illiterate staff member didnâ t know the baggage allowance policy Attendant check me Luggage to Zurich with no boarding pass for my final destination I was barred from booking our luggage together on the pretext that my wife was on a group as a result we were fined heavily for the excess luggage Right from the check in of baggage nothing seemed welcoming On reaching the gate at DFW to board American Airlines code share flight to Frankfurt the assistant at the gate announced that they would check in any HAND baggage to FINAL destination on a COMPLEMENTARY basis Priority luggage or family baggages do not get stored properly and hence creates a mess at the destination We missed our connecting flight our baggage did not arrive in Brussels the following day we had to pay to get it ourselves from the airport in the middle of winter with no winter clothes Standard run of the mill flights but was pleased and also frustrated at same time on the return leg to see every passenger have extra security checks of hand luggage Finally had no option I agreed for paying another cabin luggage too Then at the checkin the guy told me the flight is suddenly delayed to 17 05 3 5 hours delay Many Indians who complain about the service are boor themselves i e overweight luggage not listening to announcements letting children run amok etc Why did you unload my luggage in another plane Being a Govt handled airlines the staffs are never customer friendlyWhen I asked about my luggage they went on the plane and got it for me makes sense ya Had to push the wheel chair all the way through the Isle to seat row 16 the seats allotted at the checkin counter Air India refused my second baggage where Lufthansa assured me for 2 checked baggage air India changed me 200 USD again we lost our baggage and itâ s disgustingAlso the baggage handling at arrivals in delhi is pathetic Totally disgusted with lack of customer service poor information about flight delay left me feeling undervalued as a customer to help out appease the situation Lots of good things but when they lose your baggage and refuse to acknowledge or even compensateWe are still waiting for baggage no one responds to phone nos written on PIR reciept so no having to recheck baggage The hurting feature was Treatment of luggage The luggage is kept in a very negligent way it is common for luggage to get scratched Lost my baggageAnother instance 8 hours before the boarding the web checkin was throwing error The crew seemed totally ignorant of the boarding system I am the latest victim of their customer service assault with the airline not loading my baggage on a domestic flight from Mumbai to Kolkata which I was connecting from Frankfurt Horrible experience never travelled before by Air India was scared of other s bitter experiences but had left with no choice than to use Air India for the first time in 10 years and as it turned out they lost my check in baggage reported lost and registered complaint at the same day same time in Hyderabad at their Baggage Lost and found office Rajiv Gandhi International Airport to follow the process to trace it and after chasing them for several times asked me to come to file a claim As after certain period of time they will consider lost baggage as Claim Yes Sir India is also known for competent pilots but Air India is known more famously for flight delays and rude air hostesses AI could have delayed the boarding until at least 9 15 and saved us this torture We chose seats towards the front for which we had to pay nominal charges other airlines charge much more Another hour at the airport filing lost baggage form one of the worst staff in the world the ground staff might be the reason of the fall of this airline the staff with whom I had an argument was in the ticket counter and the same guy was present at the luggage check in counter very aggressive personThe air hostess on the flight were bunch of old ladies who asked the passengers to close the overhead luggage doors not just one but all of them and to top it up no thanks or shukaria Nobody bothered to apologise either for flight delay or making us stand for 30 minutes Obviously delayed flight Poor inflight entertainment disrespectful flight attendants delayed the flight and lost luggage in the middle We faced problem with the luggage which couldnâ t be loaded on time as the time gap between the two flights was just 40 minutes Almost 2 months after being in touch for a claim in relation to 7 hours delayed flight and still nobody from the company is dealing with it At the counter a lady was yelling at me that our flight tickets have been cancelled without any reason When I went to collect my baggage one lady with my nametag banner was searching me as my baggage missed and told probably loaded to some other country I literally got my luggage one day before leave the country night before Had a terrible experience with the baggage handling Then bad food bad leg room delayed flight 45 minutes to get the luggage it was horrible They have registered My complaint and said they will Call me back once they received the luggage I cleared security and settled down to wait for boarding Flight delayed 2 hours and never got to makeup for the lost time said that the boarding is delayed by over an hour Hi I am wondering if you have any experience with Air India my luggage has been lost delayed during a connection flight from London Delhi Colombo But the lady staff who attended us was very slow took around 30 mts for issuing boarding passes to 6 pax ahead of us who are traveling on international route So in summary this was the worst overall experience I have had with an airline consistent delays lost luggage rudeness with the added bonus of a unproven but probable bed bug infestation I met the baggage claim department and asked them that I waited until the last bag and the conveyer belt also stopped now my wife and i booked seats well in advance both ways and both times we were seated apart a complete disaster of an excuse for an airline check in at delhi completely chaotic you would have to get there 5 hours in advance to get through the queues never again Luggage then lost in Delhi still not returned ok â late boarding despite showing on time arrivalThe flight delayed by 1 hr While collecting my baggage I have noticed that they have spoiled my baggage by putting oil on it From their attitude they wouldn t have bothered leaving a few passengers with Boarding passes behind doubt very much if all connecting passengers made through on time It feels like abyss its over 48hrs now our baggage is still untraced there is no online site to track lost baggage or any customer care service to help What a hassle we left with our own and taking the trolly full of luggage and headed for domestic section of the airport a long Q waiting for us The security check counter for domestic passengers with D on the boarding card is cumbersome and confusing Flight delayed for 11hours I do understand that I was late but not too late that he canâ t allow me to proceed for boarding Had our flight delayed by over 2hrs 30mins due to bad weather on 25th Dec and missed our connecting flight from delhi to colombo which we got changed to a night flight after running helter skelter From Mumbai to Hyderabad and return both flights delayed for almost two hours staff didnâ t even inform me about me missing connecting flight which I missed due to the airline delay Unfortunately we had to wait for 45 mins in the baggage claim area for our bags to come Flight delayed allready 18 hours delayed and still no informationAlthough delivered quickly on arrival our luggages had lost their priority labels so we had to wait more or less until the very end to get them I got scared what if cabin luggage bag start falling on us When I asked the Air India people they simply said that they do not know where my luggage has gone itâ s Dreamliner inside crew service was also good but missing luggage andSome saying how can you put it off by merely saying Incoming flight delayAlways late slow boarding Food they just throw towards you like giving to beggars For lost luggage they argue with you about the depreciated value of your items even if you present the with a receipt recent purchase overall a very risky airline please buy baggage insurance if you are traveling by air India for sure flight delayed from JFK to Delhi by 3 hours Line not managed well had to go to another counter to pay for extra baggage and the cashier did not show up for 20 minutes They are asking for a DPR case when I clearly stated in my e mail that did not discover the damage until I got home as the baggage was shrink wrapped in Bangalore I attempted to notify the airline about my damaged luggage i was unable to take Boarding Pass from kiosk I wrote this to inform you about your staffsâ arrangements at Leh which engrave terrible experience for our 1st visit to India and will be our unforgettable memory as long as we talk about delayed flight Then luggage went missing and it took 3 days to recover Web check in was easy but delayed baggage claim Baggage took more than 20min to be put on baggage carousel When we landed our checked in luggage was taken away in error by another passenger Air india Staff at ord got an extra brain too they say it s your problem to take luggage and recheck in as if we booked ticket till delhi and a connection in morning Be prepared for flight delays so allow plenty of time if you need to catch a connecting flight There were 2 people escorting us and dragging our luggage and went through the Delhi immigration using the first business counter The baggage drop lady said many other passengers were also having same issue and maybe airline booking system has some glitch On Air India s website it is mentioned that there is 50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours Although I did web check in it took me over an hour to get my printed boarding pass staffs at the baggage drop were so slow which reminded me of sloths coupled with a staff taking a break without anyone attending counter and even without notifying floor manager Luggage delayed for 36 hours and despite acknowledging my claim I have had no contact since 6th Ma4ch but there was flight delay of around 1 5 hoursAsked for flight delay reasons or travel delay certificate and they bounce around different departments but to my shock my luggage was not there in arrival hall in rajkot Flight delay was not announced at the gate nor on tv screens After boarding the connection flight just before it takes off after rushing to the another terminal after completing immigration customs baggage drop security check To my nightmare as I landed after my domestic flight at Delhi I found out that Air India had lost my luggage Cut to 5 days later and multiple calls to the airline by multiple people with always the response that my luggage would â be on the next flightâ Consequently all our luggage was not transferred and â lostâ when we arrived in Kochi but I think needs improvement in baggage clearence at the destination airport so that people face less difficulty in catching connecting flights of other airlines Luggage took forever to arrive at Calcutta airport nearly 50 min after arrival Flight Delay can happen to any one Booked a ticket for 24 hours journey due to a flight cancellation the journey turned to 72 hoursð ð Air India staff of Cochin international airport made us wait for 7 hoursHaving collected the boarding passes we headed to the aircraft when suddenly an announcement for the last call of boarding was made To my shock and horror the staff declined him to take my baggage saying its breach of trust The excess baggage was not charged also I was provided Lounge facilities My luggage arrived in Delhi with a delay of almost 2 hours after my arrival Air India texted her previous day called her to give automated message about flight delay on morning of flightThe flight was delayed for two hours while passengers waited in the lounge with the only information being that we would leave in 20 minutes I have called customer Service department as i was unable to do web checkinAt the arrival they said the baggage was not boarded to plane Our flight got delayed by for 3 hours w 30 min incremental delays with no explanation The boarding started around 2230 and we expected the flight to leave in time So I had to file a delayed baggage claim I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi You need to be in two 2 different lines one for getting your boarding pass stamped again by the staff and then actual boarding They used to say that the there office at the other cities airport where they suspect my baggage could have gone is not picking up the phone From delayed flights to ill kept planes to bad food to condescending and surly air crew but the only drawback in this airline is that i always got my flight delay and this time by 6 hours When he travelled to India his flight got delayed by 12 hrs altogether My only complaint is that the ground staff could have found out about their Hyderabad flight s ETA before they started boarding and accordingly delayed the boarding instead of making the passengers wait inside the uncomfortable and suffocating environment of the stationary aircraft Issue was I had to bring his luggage back but was charged 400 for this as excess baggage I asked about my check in baggage as it was more than the authorised weight for Economy about Lounge Facilities at Delhi as the wait was over 4 hours my through CheckThen after we got up on the flight we were sitting in the flight for one hour due to luggage issues we got a call saying we should collect our Baggage from arrivals walk through customs and drop again at check in counter which no one at KTM Kathmandu told us i forgot my Battery bank in checked in luggage but shocking there was no information passed on 2 meI bought the ticket thru air India expecting to play with their luggage rules and realized in the airport that the operator of the flight is Alliance Air and that they only allow 15kg per passenger and 5kg of carry on we had no help with offloading and loading our luggage and l had had foot surgery The airline delayed my flight from Singapore to India so I couldn t fly from India to Paris 1st I get an email regarding the flight delay The flight overall was comfortable but the luggage fiasco would still carry a big blemish for this airlines for meCherry on top of the cake it took the airline 2 hours to unload baggage For some strange reason I had to go through the immigration at Mumbai airport and had to go through checkin procedure again at Mumbai Late start from Jeddah twice they changed the boarding gate number causing confusion at airport P s sitting outside the boarding gates and typing this cause the flight is LATE Thank God my flight to Moscow was at night but still the company Air India delayed flights made me jittery and cause discomfort only for one flight I was really afraid as i read the reviews before booking my flight ticket I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report 2 Luggage for hardly 50 passengers takes more than 30 mins After struggling for a couple hours they filed a delayed baggage report and they told meWe all missed the flights and waited for our luggage until 5 05 pm Flight delayed slightly due to late arrival of incoming flight as if the airline is not accountable for that It was delayed in arriving and boarding was quite rushed When I say ups and downs it includes late boarding by almost an hour major turbulence flight was dirty and I didnâ t get any support during the whole period I was without my luggage Worst airline you can fly when i flew in to India from vancouver and needed a connection flight Air india hosts took my economy seats and two luggages a piece I recently boarded Air India flight from Banglore to Hyderabad on arrival after waiting 1 hr on conveyor belt to collect luggage we found our luggage didn t arrive all our fellow passengers left after taking their luggage Baggage side they are little flexible which is good not like Qatar First of all despite per checkin after baggage tag printing one has to stand in common Que at Heathrow for baggage drop The return flight delayed by 3 hours and then had two gate changes Poor service delayed flight because we later learned the scheduled pilot was drunk and failed pre flight checks in flight entertainment broken Can carry 25 Kgs Check in baggage in Air India against 15 Kgs in all other budget airlines in India I was 5 mins late of checkin my flight was at 7 pmIn Mumbai though the baggage handlers could not come for work the Air India counter staff handled the baggages and saw that passengers were not put to any difficulty After half an hour waiting when I asked is reserved the officer allegedly made me get out of the airport one employee took my luggage and made me sign for going out In past 1 months i have taken 2 trips with air India and on both occasions my luggage was left behind um a frequent flyer but they have been so rude on seeing me having extra weighted luggage the service girl who was issuing our boarding passes had no idea about carrying charges and she did not allow a single kilo when we were having baby I had to pay for all the extra weight will try for other flights for sure from next time I wish for ONCE I fly on airindia on business class and get my luggage from the belt at first Travelled with my wife and daughter on the flight from Port Blair to New Delhi on 10 Nov Had received an email from Air India stating that the flight departure had been rescheduled to 1110 hr from 1050 hr what is your stand for AirIndia for issuing correct boarding passes filling up the aircraft then let us sit in for some 3 hours while mending a technical fault in the aircraft but they were lacking of storage for carry on luggage once I get my luggage back Add to that a wait at baggage carousel of another 30â And despite being told my baggage was checked through to Bangalore my suspicion that it would not be proved correct nobody thought to tell me it wouldn t it took too long to do the baggage checkin inspite of having done web chkin I hot baggage delivered at my home 3 days later At Changi Airport to my horror I found myself in Immigration which I had to cross to get to baggage claim Except for the change of timing when earlier AI had convenient flights at 5 p m late afternoon to reach destination at 6 p m they have suddenly changed to early morn No use of paying for priority baggage they own fault delayed flight andWhen I flew to Delhi I did not have my baggage Flight arrived about one hour late and finally when they were ready to board the announced was made for boarding as â ladiesThe Air India employees asked all passengers to fill out delayed baggage forms and kept taking the forms as filled The lady Ms Sarah who had horribly treated me at the check in counter and denied my co passenger to help me out with my excess baggage since he was carrying none following a ruthless behaviour of mr The line was not very long but they took a lot of time to issue boarding passes I had to walk all the way clearing security and wait for my turn for checkin at the Air India counterOf course baggage collection was delayed but I don t think that Air India is responsible for that Flight delayed at T3 for the reasons best known to them only My next flight I received my luggage back cracked When I was training month of February 2018 udaipur to Mumbai my journey day flight delayed 2 hours There was a gate change for the delayed flight too which was communicated over the PR very late but i guess thats bad service by the airport and not the airline Upon arrival at delhi airport from canada to london to delhi we did not find our luggages 2bags for a 5 pm flight boarding began at 4 and we were asked to leave the aircraft around 7 pm in a transit lounge where it took the airline a couple of hours to clear us out since we were part of an international flight This callous attitude of Air India is very frustrating it may b just a baggage for themWhen I reached the boarding gate they said that the flight is still open and they have no information Decent connection time between flights a little confusion as to baggage in Toronto but otherwise uneventful At one check in at Goa the agent realized our layover time in Mumbai would not be enough for our luggage to transfer or for us to make the flight the flight delay always due to technical reason Departure delayed by 30 minutes and there is no announcement till the start of boarding So the airline expected me to wait until the boarding to know if I had been upgraded Checkin at Delhi airport was messy as they were not monitoring the queues and ensuring that only the passengers who had done the webcheckin were in the webcheckin baggage drop queue one person works at the counters while the rest around 6 remain chit chatting despite a long passenger queue We had two flights outbound and two back with Air India in the course of the flights they did not manage to load our luggage so we were without any change of clothes for over 36 hours in tropical heat My brand new luggage was damaged They don t have a central tracking system and they don t compensate for delayed luggage None of the passengers received any luggage at the IAD airport Even they should consider for international traveller changing to local flight should consider for one two kilo extra luggage my check in luggage came out bruised and battered as if it had just been dragged from udaipur to delhi No communication from the airline to passengers regarding delay in flights or changes After passing through security and reaching boarding gate I recollected and asked ground staff that get me papers backThere was utter confusion in the cabin post boarding there was a big group of school students going back to IndiaI then managed to ask one gentleman who was boarding the same flight to help me out since he had no check in baggage with him and could claim mine under his name The only issue was at check in where I had too much baggage as expected Due to many such customers with baggage missing finally managed to hold the point of contact have been informed that baggage left in origin destination due to confusion They inform you of any flight delays well in advance and the advantage over other airlines is their baggage allowance which is 10kg more than the competitors Flight departure was delayed from 8 15 am to 9 50 The flight departure was delayed by 6 hours which was promptly informed about 4 times Careless luggage handling Once we reached the counter dropped our bags and got our boarding passes i happened to notice that our flight was delayed until 6 20 am They carried the luggage and we could not go to the lounge as we need to go through immigration and the flight was not on their computers yet as I had more than 7 hours for flight departure no other airline gives such luggage allowance But to my surprise at the check in counter they said that they would confirm it only at the boarding gate The check ins both times were good but the boarding procedure was very disorganized As for the policies and baggage loaders not so much On reaching Jamnagar I found to my utter disappointment my baggage did not travel in the same flight and I had requested at numerous counters at air India Mumbai for staff assistance for check in luggage as I have been asked to avoid picking up anything that causes exertion Luggage to be collected in India and again to be deposited for domestic flights Even when the seat belt sign didn t go away everyone was busy taking their overhead cabin luggage I obviously meant that if she cud take care of it after issuing the boarding pass and before she checked in the luggage I came from Dubai through emirates airlines to Delhi then to catch a domestic air India flight the ground staff didn t take my flight ticket and they had said that the flight is overbooked andOn the day of the flight when checking in we are told that the luggage will not go straight through to Lucknow However upon reaching the airport we came to know that neither the airport nor Air India had arrangements for a boarding ramp We were not helped with our in flight luggages till I begged and pleaded the very able bodied airhost Flight departure was delayed as we were advised it arrived late into Delhi Our connecting flight was 2 15 pm to Kolkata we missed the flight and we were directed to collect our checked in baggage to go to security check and customs clearance To start when I printed my boarding passes our seats got changed and my husband and I didn t sit together I choose Air India only coz of 25kg luggage allowance I travelled on Air India flight AI 124 on 22nd June and my baggage wasn t checked out in time I was asked to sign a form to say that the airline was not responsible for my luggage my baggage be clearedâ they told me it would be in the next day because there were no more flights that day The baggage allowance is much higher the food is decent not great though and the leg room in Y class is much more than theâ The airline is a public sector airline and the only good thing is leg space in economy class plus luggage allowance but I don t think it relates to Air India and more so to the baggage handlers at JFK Flight came on time and there was no hassle in boarding as well One would expect that our backpacks would make the 2 hour connection in New Delhi but Air India which does not allow carry on luggage on flights from Leh could not deliver them to our Rome flight on time so they showed up a week later When I put hands on the luggage again found that many delicate items got broken The only hiccup was that we were unaware you need a luggage label on hand luggage Would not recommend using this airline poor customer service poor communication and confusing information from the online service with regards to baggage allowance tickets saying 1 thing and website and customer services saying completely different cost me a lot to purchase trekking equipment in country because of this simple error One of the worst Airline and itâ s proved today earlier my friends speak about Air India flight that you fly any airline apart from Air India because they donâ t bother for their customers today one of the desk staff want to help me out to proceed for boardingThere was also only one class of fare given the size of the plane so accordingly there is a limit on baggage weight Reached Delhi late just about caught the connecting flight As is usual with AI the check in luggage did not arrive it was delivered the next day First The people at the checkin in Bangalore do not speak English well The luggage supervisor at the carousel helped us track the passenger and our luggage in the middle of the night Luggage has not arrived With flight delays and unexpected diversion of routes the filght was rescheduled For our domestic flights within India we chose Air India mostly because they have a higher baggage weight allowance but they give whopping 50 more luggage allowance than all domestic carriers Airline requires separate recheck at gate before boarding sadly once again after security check The only saving grace is that they allow 25kg for checked baggage I didn t have much luggageThe tickets prices are awesome compared to others The flight timing was spot on however Priority luggage does not come on priority When I reached Tiruchirappalli I found that My Main Luggage was not reached The plane was dirty screens broken remotes missing security issues of children laying in the aisles jumping on the seats luggage in the aisles flight attends gone missing a good part of the time people standing in the aisles for hours at a time despite warnings to useâ No one cares about cleanliness respect for others and everyone brings more than allowed limit of hand luggage and trying to insert in any open slot and arguing with the cabin crew worst behavior I was moving from Brazil to India with all my stuff inside the luggage Quick thinking ground staff of the airline arranged for the baggage to be sent to Rajgot and then get it delivered to my hotel in dwaraka by a staff travelling four hours on road and if anything is damaged but when I arrived in Delhi my bag had been banged up and ripped as was my luggage tag while boarding the captain has decided not to carry the baggage of any of the passenger collected my baggage next day for no mans land air port of Ludhiana After 72 hours in Sri Lanka without luggage calling a couple of times a day the airport for an update and fed the same oldâ The only good thing about Air India is that they offer the passengers to carry some extra luggage with them They have no idea where any of our luggage is and try to tell my my bag is probably still in the US even though I know it was at least scanned through Air India for my flight from there That s not yet a problem but when on Frankfurt Airport nobody from AI could confirm if the plane would go or maybe not and the departure delay was finally between 60 and 90 min Ultimately we reached Delhi 2 5 hours late without a word of apology from the flight crew and incorrect information about the baggage belt I had to go through all my photos to find the screenshot to prove that I have already paid for the excess luggage unless you are traveling with only hand luggage DO NOT TRAVEL WITH AIR INDIA The boarding had started and they still did not have information on the upgrade Though did not checkin bagsNo one in Air India knows where to deposit the luggage for the connecting Air India Flight Initially there was a lot of confusion because of we did not get a travel confirmation from Travelocity after booking our flight I will give it a 6 out of 10 but not happy with regards to their all around handling of luggage The boarding at Newark was smooth and did not take too much time My request for cargo luggage internal transfer at kolkatta was not entertained by theâ When I landed at my final destination the baggage never arrived no staff is available to enquire Offers more luggage weight for domestic than international travel that website does not clarify He did not offer to help stow the luggage but was obviously discontent with my helping my husband and being in his way on this narrow isleway With all the modern tracking and tagging and barcoding technologies on the luggage still they just could not tell where my bag was No priority boarding system in place and I had to pick up the entire lot 6 bags plus 2 hand luggage baby changing bag and the laptop bag also while handling a toddler Did manage to catch Jet Airways BUT new regulations for luggage limits which would have been honoured because of our booking date was not recognized by Jet Airways they wanted R500 for each kilogram we were over There was no issue with check in and boarding the staff behaved well and there was a serving of tea coffee with cakes biscuits and sweets all at free of cost which we missed badly during our return flight by Indigo Airlines During checkin one of the officer asked me unnecessary document and made me wait for an hour It would have been better if the layover time was less with out any de boarding AND when finally helping my husband stow his baggage above a very rude able bodied man hollered at me to get out of his way While I am aghast at this experience and utter disregard to a genuine grievance I hope the idiots at SpiceJet customer relations and the airhostess enjoy a satisfactory meal at my moneys expense while I now head out to buy my child a toy bag which she missed because I was refused a service which I had paid for choice is limited and the food stocked for hours and microwaved is awful tasted the worst biryani at bombay international terminal a few months ago Why couldnt lunch menu be prepared before 11 30 You could complain a little about both airports e g Kolkata is a little short of dining beverage choices after 10pm Bangkok Suvarnabhumi immigration lines are little slow at 5am coiled line up ran for over 30 minutes but these things aren t exactly within the airline s control No any drinks to serve you only drinking water Another point of shocking service was that we weren t offered a chance to buy a drink from the trolls service More room centre seat is empty and super hot food and service Then i had this problem of throwing food away paying The lunch provided was such poor quality that some of us refused it I was pissed off and returned the drink andFood was pathetic It implied I had not checked with my wife before raising my grievance OR even worse that I had been lying to get a bloody meal free The food was terrible but may be due to short distance flight Food was stale n pathetic I would say I had a bad cut on my finger while opening the food served The services are frustrating and the food is paid Didn t have onboard food Not only that even at the check in counter the staff member kept trying to foist it off on me recounting the benefits and urging me to upgrade I felt at that moment as though I was in a KFC Burger King counter refusing the extra cheese toppings they are hell bent on selling me 2 Often if you open the tray table it is dirty with remains of food on the table Also their food was horrible No legroom whatsoever and food was terrible Extremely poor food and service for extra money paid The food quality was Pathetic and I had to order separate food for my son and pay for it which is not at all justified dreadful food uncomfortable seats poor service late take off on all legs dirty aircraftThey make you pay for Spicemax for extra legroom priority boarding and terrible meal on the plane and don t oblige to the privileges Food quality is also bad But food was very expensive The food was also bad and would rate it as poor value for money breakfast was horrible It was horrible to have a meal like that and there were children on the flight but there were no controls children running up and down the aisle climbing on seats as the flight was not full people moved around and then kicked off when their food was eaten by the people who moved into the vacated seat Even after showing the lead flight attendant the receipt they refused us one of the meals Worse packing of food Meals can be avoided as they are chargeable and not prepared well I found the food to be a little expensive Just a local Bus type facility food is very expensive and tasteless Food service is so slow that middle rows have to wait for their turn only when flight is in descent mode leaving very little time for most passengers to eat while you pay star rates the food particularly at airport lounges is bad The lack of consistency in each plate of food served was disappointing food is an issue both in the airlines and worse at the airports constantly barrage you with attempts to ask you to spend more on the food cart And since they delay the flight and immediately board the flight with next lot of passengers the seats are not cleaned properly and the pockets are left with empty glasses and bottles and leftover food packets of previous passengers Food is very poor and expensive The only complaint that we had was that food can be ordered on line prior to the flightThe flight was turbulent the food beverage sale services were delayed The Food was absolutely Cold they should have a bit more stock also in case if someone further down the plane who didn t book any foodHowever the flight was trouble free and meals served is acceptable after travelling as the seats did not offer enough legroom weight rates were high food stale and smelly just as the unclean and smelling seats They re constantly attempting to get people to spend money and subconsciously influence them into making purchases that they for the entire 2 1 2 hour flight would every ten minutes bring the food cart down the aisle asking over and over again Would you like to buy something At least seats were clean mostly because of no food or drinks being served unless paid for She even refused to replace the water bottle and snacks tray on which also the coffee had fallen The food was bad and didn t seem fresh in the least bit forget about the taste being appealing In fact the cabin crew stated we have to pay for our coffee which is an insult to the airlines inability to provide refreshments to passengers of the delayed flight Food quality is poor Not very pleasent experience food worst flight atmosphere is also k that sound has literally killed me wah what an airline no food was sold being a low cost airline at 25 grand return ticket and above aa group of kesari and sf the male passengers were completely drunk casuing a mayhem and danger even to the crew of the airline So the passengers of all these three flights were simply stranded at the airport and were given zero compensation in terms of either airfare or food drinks The meal was really badgirls with less competence to handle the customers on board this flight always remains full the either increase manpower or increase competency request for buying food came half an hour before landing when the captain had already announced of boarding I also insisted that they pay for the food bill of Rs 2k as I was forced to have food in the airport lounge due to delayed cancelled flights which again went deaf years I told him you should have been manning the normal counters as I donï ½t see any body paying for your ï ½sicï ½ premium services and flashed my jet platinum and dinners card and to shut him upAll the food items inside the Flight is very expensive not worth for money This ordinary airline comes my way every time I travel to Coimbatore for at least to or fro journey with matchless consistency of terrible service from cabin space to cleanliness and zero offering pertaining to food Staff seemed surly and uninterested unless passengers wanted to buy food The airline arranged for food to be served but the quality of food was very poor The only downside was Food Food was spilled on me despite me not even having food We have to buy to eat and drink except water When I said that my cabin baggage contained food and water and that I would eat them before I board he refused my check in without paying for extra kilos even though I showed him the items Obviously no food and a low kg luggage allowance The sandwich given as a meal was utterly tasteless The food was extremely poor anyway I feel it very bad on learning that some of the Airlines are wasting money on packing and reducing as also compromising with the quality or quantity of meals so he decide scam passenger like me for his meal Absolutely lousy food The Airline is low budget airline which doesn t give food on board for free I was shocked to learn on flight that they don t provide food on flight The quality of box in which food is served is of extremely poor quality It was left removed during the whole flight and the attendants were busy selling the snacks Good to bad food small 40 seat plane felt like a crowded small bus congested space very small loo expensive snacksvery cheap the pilot did not drive it properly and the landing was terrible and food was goodThey were charging extra in return for faster chek in and in flight food which I dont like had to make do with really lousy airport food I ate the meal and then suffered with sickness for three days She still insisted that there was no additional Kids meal reflecting on her manifesto and they did not have enough food supplies even though I was sitting at the front near the engine view The food was limited and we bought chips was not liked by my child We travelled to and from Dabolim to Amritsar the flight up to Amritsar wasn t brilliant and not worth the upgrade for the awful food and limited and single drink offered They get confused while serving in flight meals paid The packaging was coming off from corners the cutlery was missing in one of the meals one meal had a dip missing benefited from delay as passengers were forced to buy food due to delayPathetic service Had to pay for food very expensive Why would I let go when I paid for my drink which was not served and taken back without any apology by the inflight staff Even in my corporate meal I have to ask them for the beverage which they ignored initially and when I asked upon for my beverage in corporate meal it s been answered let me checkand so I missed my hotel dinner We were given some snacks at 17 30 hrs as the flight was delayed i had a terrible experience while trying to book pre board meal option There were no free drinks or food on the plane unless you upgraded your seat For a 1 hour 45 Minutes flight they took almost entire flight time to serve the beverages food to other passengers Though the breakfast was served timely the staff forgot about serving me the beverage and gave it to me ten minutes before landing The passengers who pre booked their meal but were seated beyond the row 10 had a real struggle getting the meal in time Unlike other airlines which do not serve hot food in short flights it offered the same Food is Indian cuisine and can be very spicy so ask for not spicy if you don t like heat After paying for my meal I am returning without having my drink is this the service you offer to your privilege guest extremely pathetic Expensive menu in the flight with limited choice of food The air hostesses on the flight acted like vendors selling food as they were only interested in selling food items even water was not served to the passengers Despite it they did not give me anything to eat or drink which was offered to other passengers seating next to me It was majorly disturbing to see that happen making it almost next to impossible to consume the food paid for by me Pathetic Experience Understaffed uncourteous air crew no hot meals despite long menu card in the seat pockets There will be no complementary food in spice jet you have to pay for food We were promised to provide meal due to delayWe understand that they do not serve any food or refreshments on the flight and one has to buy During the flight there seemed to be unnecessary delay in serving of meals All tray tables were permanently inclined causing food tray and beverage to slide towards passenger They did not offer any tea or snacks nor did they inform me about the delay On Time Food was not bad But after getting into flight i feel very bad by sawing it s food and services Food you don t have to worry about the seat covers were tired off push back was not working seems like they are using there very old flight for the service in flight foodShort eat on the flight such as sandwiches are available A person to catch the 7 20 flight has to reach airport has to reportat 5 20 am which means he has to leave home at around 4 am if it is a three hours flight he won t land before 10 am therefore he has to miss the breakfast The Bagdogra airport is a mess the security staff is ill trained the airline staff over busy and there are very few food options But received a cold tasteless snack to eat I wasn t aware that the food had to be pre booked Food was not good The overall the experience of the flight was fine but the food taste was bland possibly it was a bad day for the airline and me there was a piece of charcoal in my food bought a chicken tikka roll Didn t buy any food onboard Food not upto the markEven though the flight was delayed long past dinner time no snacks were served I prefer pre booking my meals since paying during flight seems very cumbersome pulling change etc Again no relief since drinks are not included with meals and you have to pull your wallet out I had not prebooked any food and wanted to buy breakfast or atleast a sandwichOne more thing spicejet prior to check in tries very hard through e mails to sell its choice seats pre booking of foods etc They don t provide you any snacks even if they are late It took the attendant almost more than an hour to come to us with a meal as they were attending a couple of other customers When I mentioned that I have a pre ordered food they looked lost The ground staff said they have arranged food but when we went to the food counter the promised options were unavailable ulti aa gayi to please food avoid kare only coldrink and biskit etcOverall no nonsense service with better than our expected service and food and on time arrival was something we saw and that is all we need don t we They did not offer any food or drinks Also whoever said that Airline food has to be boring never flew on Spicejet Meal is served in packaging that is very unstable and difficult to handle especially when you are menu includes sambar dosa Mite in rice is common but not expected food served in flight We paid almost 2200 per person for a return flight and it seemed alot to pay as we had no additional services included in terms of meals or priority services Besides the food gets served late and so has to be swallowed fast to meet landing parametersAbove all they do not even offer a cup of drinking water inside the flight Inspite of a short flight all cold beverages were not available inspite of being on the menu which was paperboat Paid snacks are rather poor choice of food for in flight order is not much unless you pre book your meal Pre order a meal for a short flight else staff may not get to your order in time Food vouchers at 5 AM can t make up for ruined travels however I felt that the food was a bit too overpriced We were their Priority Customers but we have not given such treatment and in Breakfast they do not have even varieties of Juices to serve and our seats were in front but no space to keep your hand luggage which they have accommodated somewhere elseEven the meal choices which were supposed to be on the particular date were not available on board Food as usual had only a very limited choice so nothing great to speak about even though it was an international flight cabin crew was good helpful however onboard food is very costly as usual Then with our upgraded Spice Max ticket where we are supposed to get a meal none was provided on this flight The hostess stated that she did not have non veg meals any more and was more interested in pushing to us veg sandwiches In Chennai airport my daughter and I were told that we were not eligible for food refreshment vouchers as the flight time was changed but not cancelled Unhelpful crew did not make any attempt to serve me my prepaid dinner in 1 hr did not help me in getting space for my cabin baggage promised to changeit and did not promised to bring it to me after landing but did not air hostess Food also not too bad for the price I paid Since it was already too late into night the meals snacks ordered were served much beyond the time to be of interest Why would any guest return his drink if he has already opened the bottle we too have that sense and will never expect it to be replaced is neither they keep up the time nor they provide snacks if they are late The meal with Spicemax is not that good It was a morning flight and the complimentary meals were not that good I received a reply that only 35 minutes left in decend to Delhi so coffee can not be served SpiceJet uses a Q400 on Surat Jaipur route took off on time Q400 is quite spacious from inside but too noisy on SpiceMax seat 1A not too many food options as its a Q400 had to adjust with a sandwich on the name of Meal There also weren t any soft drinks on the flight I have paid upfront for food and the seat which costed me Rs 1798 when asked they said they don t have any info about 2nd meal we had to pay for a meal and our seats together this resulted in a more expensive flight that expected Sandwich was very cold and tasteless They offered no tea or snacks and then they asked us to stay in a hall where there was noting to do Literally no tea coffee not even water but food is much gutter pathetic even Air Histress agreed Got to the airport on time having paid extra for SPICE MAX expecting that I would board the plane before others as it said I was guaranteed significantly more leg room complementary meal priority check in priority boarding and priority luggage delivery but I get irritated of the selling of food they do Only spicy food options for the meals which is a disappointment but they have lovely mango juice A little variety in food on flight may be asking for too much in today s competitive times but will be appreciated During this time no proper refreshment was served by the airline except a cheese sandwich Disappointed that they do not give options to chose from the vegetarian options available on board Wish I had seen their Menu before take off I would surely had ordered we were boarding flight we waited for cleaning staff to get down airhostess was instead of welcoming the passengers at the rear gate was busy talking over accounts of number of supplies of cuppa noodles and biryanis 3 I bought on board snack The meals came in another 15 minutes and it was actually the most shoddy packaging I have ever seen in a long time The first thing you saw when the food service tray came to you was a air sickness bag the food options are really blah in my opinion to get a fist row seat on 15 th of this month 2018 jan 2900 plus 1000 plus 399 seat meal combo for onward and return 19 th 2100 plus1000 plus 399 altogether 7600 for a return leaving kochi at 1 10 pm and returning at 3 pm in afternoon just is not value for money unless desperately short of time or funded by sombody else or on busiuness official dont spend that kind of money kindest rgds to spice jet staff thank uthere was huge variety from guava juice to mixed fruit juice to coke I asked for veg meal but the same was not available exhausted and hence I had to satisfy my hunger with veg sandwich only Food options for corporate booking was a big let down The snacks we received being in SpiceMax seats were flung at us not even handed to us When he got to my row to serve food and drink I asked him to confirm that it was him and he admitted that it was I had breakfast in the Chennai airport so didn t opt for onboard services Otherwise SpiceJet does not provide complimentary meals in any of its flights for itall airlines still have the same drinks for past 2 years Wish they were more transparent about delays could ve planned a good dinner in Mumbai Drawback there was no coffee missed that We were given Dry Face Wipe telling it as Hot n Wet Face Wipe were denied bringing other were not served Hot Meal for which we were entitled and were informed that only 1 hot meal is available that too on payment basis and no coca cola or any other soda beverage is in stock But I do receive all the useless msg by this airline like upgrading your seat discounts or booking meals etc The dining thing was broken but they don t care as they don t serve you free food The snacks are good but the meal is not very tasty No there was no food voucher no complimentary tea or coffee There was no food onboard it was not Spice jetSome of the downsides is there are no blankets also there is no food other than what you have to buy Since or flight got late due to some technical issue they gave us packed snacks on board FOC I ordered food but everything in the menu was not available I had to gobble my meal I was disappointed from the time I got there as there was no priority check in the flight was delayed no priority boarding definitely no significantly more leg room complementary meal was appalling and the only saving grace was that my luggage was delivered first I request never have any food in this spicejet Airline totally waste costly n taste nothing street food are better then this Spicejet Airline Only hassle we faced to get jain meals as crew offered veg meals of average quality and without choice I could have done without the breakfast not upto the mark and they didn t give any complimentary dinner for this reason need to buy our dinner separately wish they had more options on the menu for vegetarians No food served too Finally when reached Delhi T1 to my surprise the staff starting dislodging food trolley rather passengers and that felt bad since now I could feel who was important for Airlines All airlines are charging good enough for onboard food but not providing good service taste and quantity during journey Unfortunately being a corporate booking my meal of veg platter was booked However we didn t get Unlimited Meals and Beverage and even our previously pre booked meals were denied to us stating that we are now entitled to complimentary meals When we tried to order a Beverage after meals were over we were told that we will have to pay for the same Just than they served another fallow passenger with hot beverage hence i asked the crew why was I not served hot beverage though they served the other passenger And we received no excuse no water no food For for each time the air hostess said ï ½due to technical reasons no food or beverages will be served I travelled twice with this airlines and both times food was not served with this airline There was so much confusion that those guests who pre booked meals also waited for long time before they get their meals Airline didn t take any responsibility to serve some food to the passengers untill 11 50 pm when all were starving and were getting ready to board the flight It was a terrible experience flying with spicejet from kolkata to bangkok the attendants were least bothered to cater to needs of passengers the food served was some probably some stale food just warmed up before being served Regis Mumbai when I encountered this airlines service no food tea coffee drinks Also the In flight Food Beverage services should be priced similar to a local sector and they should not charge a premium just because one is travelling international As it provides only paid meal snacks but most of the time you will not get the food of your choices Not many options in the menu if you do not pre book the meal Food beverage service was bound up swiftly after that none of passengers got hint of that Since the flight was delayed for 1 hour no complimentary drink snacks or food offered by the cabin crew as a gesture of goodwill or to compensate the delay All the messy food they are distributing among their Passengers No food is served No food as they didn t have enough food on board and then one small drink My suggestion At Least the Cheap Flight Airways to provide a welcome drink and chocolate to passengers I breezed through security though it was a bit crowded popped in to the departure zone to have a snack sip a coffee shop before the flight I would skip Chennai airoport also not very organized no food no good resting placesHowever when the Kids special meal box was served my kids noticed the Kit Kat chocolates missing in both the bags Also no offer to serve snacks or food inspite of being way beyond lunch time but already at the second row they didn t have any choice in drinks for the menu Pre booked meal not served ac failure a Veg lunch of Rice Thai Red Curry a Non veg lunch of Rice Chicken By the time they hit the last row they did not even offer a glass of water or tea or coffee This time spicejet also managed to misplace the kids lunch I had booked and since the itinery was not returned to me at the counterUnfortunate that there were no complementary food and drinks on board Such service used to be good time pass and kept mind engaged but sadly missing My experience was good and first time I had to choose a veg sandwich as they didn t have non veg optionThis is a 2 hr journey and the time is actually mid day and with these mini snacks one cannot complete their lunch Apparently spice jet has started serving alcohol on their international flights and boy did these guys enjoy their drinks Cheap flights is the only main point to choose spice jet they even not serve any tea or coffee complimentary food offered was dam expensive No complimentary water or coffee was provided by the airline at the airport nor inflight At food they served just in packet of 2 x2 6 with half A4 size tissue and no water and there was no choice for breakfast The options for breakfast are not good that s what I felt The desert along with the meal was not at all good Premium seat selection priority boarding works out great but food and hence money gets wasted for kids The airlines seems to be only interested in selling various goods and facilities like seat location leg space priority boarding a farce anyway food merchandise etc etc at exorbitant rates rather than providing basic services to the customers You are charged from seat selection to everything and more be prepared to shell out surprise charges on baggage food terribly smelly and dirty seats For food no comments I did not eat This was a low fat meal The meal is terrible The main reason is the lack of flavour in food and lapses in services although the cabin was comfortable and spacious AVOID THIS AIRLINE if you can not much legroom sound system not working as headsets are faulty dirty toilets no hand lotion and cologne in lavatories food is awful the list is endless I only booked it with etihad since it was the cheapest worse food ever rude crew sometimes the just ignore you better food served quantity was quite low and were not in the right combination to eat Food was awful and little choice virtually no leg room particularly when seat in front reclined stop off and transfer in Abu Dhabi is good but REALLY expensive if you do stop over And they REFUSED to give even a MEAL ticket The food was mediocre both ways e g no fresh rolls but tasteless hard rolled breads and horrible drink called coffee Our flight from Brussels to Abu Dhabi of more than six hours we only got one meal and no even snacks They dished up breakfast then which was awful The food was very disappointing tasteless and we were starving Pathetic service Pathetic food Food terrible Food was terrible seats are smaller and harder than other airlines Singapore Emirates Really poor experience lost luggage terrible food dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper on all flights and a reluctance from the crew to fill up my water bottle after being advised that I could not take a full water bottle on in Abu Dhabi and there being no water facilities in the departure lounge The food was shameful and the gluten free wasn t much better Horrible rude stuff and food Food is awful and that is annoying on a 15 hrs flight The food is terrible Some of the food was inedible and I was starving by the time I reached my destination As a last comment I must say some people are an absolute disgrace with the mess they leave behind them food thrown on the floor and all sorts of rubbish just left on the floor and seats crew come round frequently with a bin to collect rubbishPoor quality food no additional food i e self service snacks soft drinks during the night often available on US airlines where you can grab a snack on your way back from the restroom on your little airplane walkSuch uncomfortable seats and rubbish food Pathetic food quality rude staff at airports and in plane we are stuck in Abu Dhabi at a worst hotel called Mafraq terrible food for vegetarians in this hotel a Manchester City season ticket holder so feel some loyalty to Etihad but really the food is bloody awful I did try one of the meals was truly awful meals were disgraceful in terms of quantity as well as quality Staff were stressed and not very friendly food was horrible and served in hurry it was more like throwing food to passengers not proper servingSome staff were more engaging than others but never once was anyone rude or didn t want to suuply food or drinks The food is absolutely disgusting and one portion of over cooked mush and one drink on a 7 hour flight is a joke Actual flight to Abu Dhabi was OK food awful and flight attendants rude The food was awful and the planes extremely uncomfortable The food was awful The food on flight from Mumbai to Abudhabi was crap Disappointed with the whole customer service experience onboard staff were rude food was terrible and we were offered a cup of water 5 times during our 14 hour flight Do something about your awful food and increase the drink service Food was terrible The plane was REALLY old the food was terrible my food was spicy but my wifeâ s was not even though we had the same meal the LCD screen was blurry and they started end the entertainment 35 minutes after takeoff prior to landing and finally it was super cold I and my wife traveled from New Delhi to Abu Dhabi on 24 1 19 on morning flight at 9 am had very bad experience the air hostesses were very rude and the food was the bad in tasteFood was disgusting and not as described by the attendants and airline expected passengers to pay for snacks The lead had to endure a ridiculous customer complaint for the issue with the food Nasty junk food Broken seats Malfunction of entertainment Back seat storage pockets dirty Non sense air conditioningThe business class lounge at Abu dabi is poor in comparison food is fairly shocking only one shower available and a single room for smokers nowhere to vape without sitting in the smoking box food is horrible Terrible service terrible food dirty aeroplane and the least legroom of the Middle Eastern airlines The food is bland the desserts taste like crap the toilet is really smelly and thereâ s piss on the toilet cover we had one male attendant that was lovely Food horrendous The airline refuses to provide compensation except for providing Hotel and food dirty as no one care to put the trash in the plastic bag and the food The food on both outgoing and return flights was awful very minimalist and poor quality Disgusting food worst ever Food was terrible service was bad Bad service delivered by annoyed staff with inedible food The overall experience is very comparable to a low cost company The food was horrible the selection of movies is super bad etcHorrible Meal Veg or Non Veg served late in the plane I have never experienced a similar service failure in my 30 plus years of flying to and from the Middle East food is horrible flight attendants are cold and didnâ t event want to show that they care or could do anything to satisfy us in matter of fact they seem like they donâ t want to be thereFrom checkin to food and also the rude crew all were an issue so i had to smell farts for the next 14 hours and the food is so patheticno toiletries kit 5 food is worst than some budget airline refer photo bread is cold no butter no appetizer no dessert Beside in spite of reaching around 9 30 in the morning there was no proper breakfast available The food is disgusting We were thirsty and hungry the food was absolutely disgusting and not much of it which is probably fortunate although it was an awfully long flight to be unfed and unattended to Awful dessert too Very un comfortable awful food and had to constantly request water or drinks The Meals on board the flight has become pathetic Food was horrendous and inedible wine was like piss Everything is just terrible right from food customer service to their wait times because of the level of disorganization Staff is friendly overall however the food is average and the most annoying aspect is the on board entertainment No bar stale food and very rude staff Quality of food also sucks The food on this flight was pretty awful and did not change on the return The food service was terrible for nearly 24 hours on their flights we were given one main meal and one snack meal from Sydney to Abu Dhabi we also didnâ t get a choice of food as they had run out of the second choice before even getting through half the plane This time the seats were very uncomfortable for such a long flight the food was a disaster they returned with cheese and biscuits without any butter for the crackers I did not receive any hot drink with the meal which I was very annoyed about when you consider how much we pay for this class Very under qualified staff lower than average service and pathetic breakfast Seats in Economy were very narrow making it very cramped on such a long flight the food was awful and the air conditioning was so cold everyone was putting on parkas and beanies if they had them Food is bad range of beverages limited EY68 half front part of the plane is crazy warm Old aircraftsAt every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff disgusting food poor service scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line The food itself wasnâ t too bad The air hostess was surly and rude and the food was very poor seriously 9 hour flight and no mealHard cold bread rolls with Rock hard butter on all flights In fact this was the worst food I have been served on a plane and on both legs Manchester Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur I did notice the harsh behaviour once again when I had to order my drinks staff were down right miserable and rude service was poor and the food fair at best My family became sick after eating food in the flight The food was bad I remember well our first experience and it was not one to brag about terrible spicy food and a poor standard of service on such a long flight Also the veg food is pathetic From new york to abu dhabi the quality of food was worse after that they bought me a dried up half dead left over kids pasta meal which was just some penne with a watery tomato sauce The screen was broken hanging on an angle and did not react to touch the tray was broken and leant so much towards me that I risked receiving the food in my knees every time I wanted to cut a pieceFood horrific staff unresponsive to passengers needs I did mention this to Etihad to no avail Worst flight ever time to reshuffle staff work on customer service rather thanFood service was awful as we were served with a express lunch bag containing one spinach and tomatoe patties one water bottle and pack of juice The 2nd plane from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok looked tired and was cramped again the food was the standard of a low budget airline Will not fly Etihad again as the food was probably the worst I ve had on any airline so far Terrible lounge in manila its like a nightmare from the 70s or 80s with an amateurish food buffet and drink setup not fresh or inviting at all Such a disappointment paying all that money to have to ask for a drink not having any thing left for food Old cramped poor service and horrible food Quality of food was horrible Staff refuse to provide food according to dietary needs for the 38 hours 45 minutes travel using theâ On another note the food was absolutely appalling I was about to have heat stroke horrible foodHowever food was very bad The food was disgusting The food is terrible and barely edible we were given tiny sandwiches with nothing but some spinach leaves and hummus on what looked like dinner rolls with another one just a tiny piece of cheese and red paste Food was bad Very poor service and food on our flights Late departure time but the plane ran on time slept most of the flight time except for meal times which were served promptly Lastly the food was so bad The food was horrible Food and service poor What s worse is the constant advertising of their buy on board menu which leaves customers confused and ultimately feeling ripped off Terrible service very bad food and the plane is extremely out of date The food was really disappointing then we caught another flight from abu dhabiplane was old and small specially for a 14hour flight also food was crapThe food and service were horrible Instead 1 tasteless and awful meal on the firstâ they refused saying all coffee is finished all u can get is water I thought KLM had the worst food slop before traveling Etihad but Etihad food not unbearable Harassment of travellers in Abu Dhabi behaviour of the Immgration officials were very high handed service quality food quality were very bad in the plane that off pleaseâ I actually needed a drink of water for my unwell childfood was disgusting food we chose was the kosher kind and originating from new york the food was awful The food options are very poor and flight crew are rude Paid 1000â for the freaking tickets to not even able to have plain water and receive food worst than anything I received my bags after 5days in bad conditions all of them broken and all the food got spoiled It is a complete bad Service in Food Drink behavior of crew and each and everything Food on board was bad too The food service and drink service in Business Class was poorRubbish was infrequently collected outside meal times so zero space also became quickly cluttered On the flight back from Abu Dhabi to Manchester this morning we were given a small filled roll coffee etc around 40 minutes into the flight we were then given a terrible meal which was breakfast around 2 hours from landing it was a vegetarian oriental meal the fault of ordering this is mine it was awful looked like some sort of wet rice Useless number as menu does not address rescheduling a flight and cannot speak to real person husband didn t say a word because he likes to stay away from arguments while I felt like punching that man in the nose on the flight food quantity was very less food arrived very late FA s were ready to get in an argument with passengers they did not care if people were walking during a turbulence there was a lady who asked for some waterFood was the worst I had in last 20 years on airplane The use of International multi country air crew can be an advantage but I noticed poor intereaction between them occuring when serving meals Food selections were really bad and the staff were not good either Food awful back to the bad old days of airline food non excistant food was poor will never use this airline again either emerites or quatar in futureFlight was comfortable enough but found the service and quality of food shocking The food quality was poor and not a great personal service Food pretty poor We had to wait 20 hours in Abu Dhabi but didnt get any food voucher Food very poor Insisted on waking people up to give them food a couple of hours in to the flight seemed odd The food was not great and drink service poor If you have a stop over of more than about 16 hours they offer you free accomodation and food The meals are now small and quite dreadful The aircraft was dirty the staff on board for the first leg of the trip weren t the nicest and food was horrible The food was appalling a couple of servings of water and the rest of the flight passed We upgraded our seats at the airport and they refused to accommodate our meals I only eat chicken and they forced me to have meat meal because they dont have The Lounge used by several airlines was dreadful poor selection of food dirty tables and floors The food was poor quality of food is poor just merely a main course served on a tiny round tray a bun this is the worst meal I ever given by an airlines if I am paying low cost carrier airfare I would think is alright as is budget but is a no no for Etihad been the national carrier of UAE I would expect their inflight service will surpassed their rival Emirates but I am totally wrong in this aspect The food was served in a random fashion and was dreadful the roll which didnâ t even have butter with it was more like a stale rock all in all awful the tea and coffee were stewed and so strong and breakfast was 2 thin biscuits and more awful tea and coffee this flight did not match up to EasyJet the return flight was no better either Iâ m not in a rush to fly with them again Then they were very slow with serving food forgot often our orders of water etc and completely forgot to give desert for example Food was poor The food quality is very poor One staff accidentally hit my head with his shoulder while he was serving the food and he did not even acknowledge that Never had such a bad meal in any airline was food isn t as good as it was and only 1 hot meal per leg cant really complain as priceâ food being thrown to the passengers without any trays but in bags less low quality food Worst staff you can ever find worst food with no choice eat it or stayVery disappointed with Etihad especially the leg from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi poor service poor food It was so awful that while on 2nd trip I have to get some fast food so to avoid in flight taste less and non fresh meal and cold bun that was hard to eat I realise long haul flights in economy are no picnic but was really disappointed in the poor service and really ordinary food on this flight Compared to other airlines it is cheaper but service was poor and the food selections mediocre I had booked my meal with my flight booking requesting a low fat option however did not receive this at any meal Unsmiling and disinterested cabin staff generally very poor service standard of food poor I can tolerate the poor food uncomfortable seats and poor inflight entertainment system Try eating a meal on a flight with the tray at an awkward angle and digging into your stomach gave me an oltion to throw away my babys water milk and food Inflight service was spotty food inedible I flown lhr to bkk the food was terrible if u can call it food a hot dish with a dryed up swirl etihad whats happened u was the best with so many airlines to choose from i the meal was awful and for breakfast we got only a cup of coffe und a cookie This is the tip of the iceberg uncomfortable seats poor quality food being woken up to be given a bottle of water that I didnâ t really want all I wanted to do was sleep Food was poor the breakfast was terrible Much food was wasted and many passengers were unhappy with the meals Etihad has become a LOW SERVICE HIGH COST airline with their 20 kg max bag allowance their horrendous poor meals their prohibitive extra weight policy for which they charge you 40 for EVERY extra Kg the extremely uncomfortable seats with reduced reclining capacity and the rudeness of the crew the most arrogant uneducated low class stewardesses in the market Don t hope for a salad or dessert to go with your main meal as there aren t any if anything was an issue it was that we were unaware that the sleep masks as we didnt open them allowed you to be woken or not for food as we didnt use themThe food was not at all good and the toilets smelt at the start of the flight and I think it was the worst food plate he had ever had so on the return flightJust wondering why Etihad s food quality gone so bad and below standards The meals were so bad during the flight which is 9 hours and half flight and they used to provide 2 mealsâ The three hour transit turned into a mad dash from one flight to another with no chance of a shower or food and the food on board is insufficient for a 24hr trip food very poor eg crackers with no cheese or anything to eat with them In 60 years of flying this was the worst food I have experienced dreadful Whilst the seating and food was acceptable from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi the flight from Abu Dhabi to Rome was quite poor Meal was very bad The food was very poor and mean portions presumably to encourage you to buy snacks in between the set meal times but from there to Perth the food was even worseNo food provided as they apparently had no meals then they couldn t check me in because of a computer error so check in took an hour the food was awful then on way home they allowed other passengers to sit wherever they wanted which messed up food orders and also caused a lot of disturbanceFood appalling Considering the amount spent on packaging perhaps they could instead include at least a frikkin cold sandwich Food was the worst I ve had in a long time Poor food and very bad check in as it seemed that the staff were only looking to loot the customers The food was the worst I have had in 60 years of flying You can now buy food on the plane if you are still hungry and you surely are Have had good flights in the past but our recent experience with poor service and food will make us look for other airlines in the future When you call for service you just get ignored and the food is not at the standard of other airlines economic classThe comment was that they could not guarantee the foods served would not have come in contact with any nuts or nut products fair enough but what about the special kitchens that prepare religious meals that have to follow strict quality control to make sure of no cross contamination The food in economy was bad and the planes are old and seats to cramped even Business had gone downThe food o n the flight was dreadful Quite disappointed with the quality of food and service on Etihad You have to fight to get more than one drink Food is hit and miss some dishes were ok some were way overcooked overall average â Service and hostess not nice Trays meal very bad uncomfortable seats and planes are not cleaned wellWas disappointed with the on board service or lack of it and the food quality was dreadful The food we had during flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi and from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow was the worst Food was poor and on one occasion cold highly processed and tasteless and we donâ t get the stale roll with butter and I had to hold on to my food tray so that it didn t slide off onto the floor Ok but again food poor The food was so bad on this Airline that out of the four meals they served we could only eat the last one and that was because after 24hours we would eat anything Extremely disappointed that only one meal was scheduled to be served and none of the options were even available The standard of the food that was served throughout all flights was very poor Crew was rude and not friendly and they were very dry answering question that if any choice of food available The Express Snacks served on early morning take off are an absolute disgrace when compared to what you would get on Emirates It was like flying on Easy jet sleesy jet no food or drinks unless you wanted an expensive lousy debatable roll The food served was poor and lame The meals served for 13 hour flight was poor quality I was disappointed when they had forgotten to bring the drinks we ordered with dinner then we felt simply ignored when they failed to bring us our desert yet served everyone else The food choice was also terrible on other airlines you get a lot of sides with your meal there was only one side with this mealOK now what has changed small things like no amenity bags on overnight flights no hand sanitiser in the bathroom food has worsened from average to bad The food was poor hard bread rolls not very appetising main course no cheese or chocolate Toilets filthy air temperature too cold food the worst ever on all four legsPoor food and very uncomfortable seats The food for adults was barely edible and there was no meal choice The first leg of the journey from London to Abu Dhabi was on a larger aircraft but still the customer service and food on offer was very poor It was a terrible experience and only realised when me and my wife realised we had both received different meals I am Vegetarian and the food was quite disappointing compared to the meat meals We decided to fly with what is reportedly the number 1 airline in the world and must say that we were very disappointed with the planes and food Things have improved but for nearly three years in a row Etihad s administration kept on messing up my air points and forgetting my Asian vegetarian meal requests It was just as bad on the way back except we received a full measure when we ordered a drink Once we were given a menu to choose from and later we were asked to choose from another menu due to mistake of the list and what had been loaded in to the aircraft of dishes Packed in like sardines the poorest of airline food bearing in mind how limited airline food is 14hr flight with the worst food possible and absolutely no option to purchase anything else Flight was ok but food and beverage was very poor The food quality was not bad although a few dishes lacked flavour No breakfast and service extremely slow I never did get my mains so the meal was a little plain and disappointing Coffee is a bad idea too Experience with Etihad has been worst quality and quantity of inflight meals was worst only one meal was served in 9hrs flight in addition at aroundMeals forget water going around nil Less than halfway thru the flight we ran out of drinking water they stopped all food and drink service they put bottles of drinking water in the toilets Meal choices decidedly poor now they want to sell you snacks in flight to compensate let alone how to get it working once my wife told them as i asked several times then to top it off the hostess ran her drinks cart into my knee to avoid those with heads and legs who had 3 and 4 seats to themselves and did not even apologize The food on the plane i found to be hit and miss of lateAfter a wait for food my wife decided to lay down and go to sleep hence the not telling them till she woke up was ok but the food coming back was very poor Etihad has gone downFlew out to HCMC in economy class flight attendants very friendly but service was average the food was extremely poor There was an obvious difference between the Qantas operated aircraft and Etihad one firstly when it is meal time the Qantas staff insist that all the seats are upright the dreamliner boasts more leg roomI was very disappointed as I never thought that food poisoning was possible while on a flight Another meal served in between was of poor quality and had no choice Apart from that no complaints except for the food I didn t like itWe suggest you bring your own enough food if you don t want to get sick and starve for 14 hrs The meals were really cheap looking very low quality My only slight moan was the service and food I have flown with Etihad on a number of occasions long haul and have always been very happy however a little disappointed on this occasion with food and drinks not up to usual standard AUH Business lounge worn seats dirty toilets dry bread Etihad did not provide enough food on the 13 hour flight we were given a roll for breakfast None of them looked like they wanted to be there nobody smiled the service seemed completely haphazard and the food was bland and barely lukewarm The food was bland and tasteless and they stuffed up my wife s and daughter s gluten free request the attendant actually said that this happens all the time The food was very disappointing service offered was minimal Returning my bottom went to sleep seats uncomfortable food still awfull a wrap that i am sure was made out of carboard or something similar However business lounge in Melbourne was little bit disappointed with poor food choice The only issue was the food which was pretty bad from Manchester to Abu DhabiThey are rude and impolite to economy customers in regards with offering food and helping them with anything they need While lots of food and drinks were complementary the variety of food is disappointing Their service is i dont care attitude their meals are now consistently poor and when there is a delay we missed our connecting flight although there was still half an hour to go for over 15 hours We wanted to grab a bite so quite hungry once on board as a 10 pm flight We were in an old cramped plane and when our dinner arrived the flight attend was asked could the person in front please sit up as it was impossible to get the dinner on the tray Food revolting a bun that seemed to keep appearing on our trays with every meal inedible more of a weapon than a food group The food these food pockets are pretty hideous and my children won t even take them They missed out rows while serving drinks Food beverages are poor for a business class food quality is average and drinks are really low standard the good part is that one can select the moment to take the meal And even though we were confused cos the food trays had not been cleared in the longest time leaving us unable to sleep Alcohol was hard to get on all flight legs only offered once during each meal service and subsequent requests for a second drink were ignored Meal service was poor compared to other airlines children in groups for fun competitions and gamesâ etc In flight purchases of drinks and snacks were ignored for 2 hours On this flight at a certain point there was only one menu left Passengers do not wait for 6 hours with an empty stomach for the next meal It just seemed to be to much trouble for the crew and the midnight snack of a roll that was very dry with filling you couldn t find was practically throw at you Food was appalling service was virtually non existentIn the past year we have had bedbugs in business class and now on our last trip to China my husband was served OFF FOOD twice both going and coming home I wish i had more food and beverages Ever commenting on my outward flights to London via Abu Dhabi in May listing the poor food surly staff and basic lack of concern for passengers during the 9 and 14 hour flights The steward taking care of our section a heavily made up young man could barely conceal his contempt for the passengers and served our meals in a rushed abrupt manner A friend who is a frequent flyer tells me that he has been refused a snack because one can only have a meal and one snack per flight They ignore you outside main meal times For example they serve some sort of sliders buns with cheese slice and tomato as snacks which I couldn t eat because they were so bad They only provided a welcome drink and not even a glass of water for 6 hours and they were apparently annoyed when I asked the breakfast Pathetic old aircrafts flying in and out of india and not even a patch on emirates truly disappointed by the food and service on board and was forced to carry my own food onboard on my way back as the size of meals was microscopic and inedible looks like they have no money left as they start selling food immediately after the first service to make an extra buck low temperature Poor drinks offer Service was as expected whilst the food was typical airline food Of all the airlines i have flown the food is appalling without hesitation We specifically asked if the food contained nuts in which we were told by the air hostess they not sure One small box of food at the beginning cold sandwich 7 hours into the flight and then another small box of food towards the end The food was mediocre to say the least with poor choice or no choice at times Meals were poor and to the minimum The meals were disappointing and so we decided to let the airline allocate our seats and were in all cases non window seats and the food was poor Then the food was the worst we have experienced on a long haul flight Food is barely edible The meal was slow coming which is a pain on late take offs With the exception of one flight food on all four flights we did was very poor The food was inedible the planes were always late taking off and landing all sectors and the seating allocation a total mystery probably because theyâ Not on our recent Etihad flights a small oval plate and take away container with tiny meals and bread roll was all on offer during an 8 hour flight and not much more on a 13 hour flight but till that time Sandwich is already so cold so not possible for me to eatFood was just ok nothing special The call attendant lights werenâ t responded to and somehow the plane was out of over half the menu items despite being only 5 hours into our 16 hour flight Food Offer to you even after Choosing Hindu Meal is Worst One more thing those scented hygiene wipes we get before meals should be unscented the scent is too strong for me without sinus problem I traveled a 24 hour long flight from India to Sweden and after I managed to avoid to get food posioned my whole time in India I can now ironicly state that when I came home after this long trip I have suffered from food posioning The food served during the flight was completely frozen I flied to US and return for 15hrs and the plane was old and seats not comfirtable at all and served us with only 2 meals that s it The cabin crew were not friendly and happy at all Food is given in paper bags its ashame Etihad now have an expensive snack menu and so they want the passengers hungry enough to pay 3 USD for a coffee and 5 USD for a chocolate chip biscuit I waited 2 weeks before writing a review just to see if I was still feeling disappointed with the lack of service and poor quality food She served only brownie n bread and told there is no enough vegetarian food But the midnight snack a wrap was cold and very poorly packed Nooo breakfast served after all night flight Waste of time reserving seats and ordering children s meals The only issue we had was that the food was not nice The food was pedestrian in the FCO AUH sector with noisy chidren preventing sleep However from Abu Dhabi to Manchester terrible service no breakfast left and what they had left wasVery disappointing service average food and very very bad airline crew On our out bound flight from JFK to Abu Dhabi there was similaly very little food On an 8 5 hour flight they only served one tiny meal with a bread roll and candy bar on the side She called the attendant when her husband woke up to server him the drink n cake and again the attendant said sorry all cakes are finished The fight attendants provided no baby food Last time I flew with them there was only 1 drinks service and the food was just about tolerable in saying that their prices are more than competitive flight times suit me down to the groundThe flight attendants continually forgot to bring food and drink orders never made an effort to follow up and left meal trays on our tray tables for hours before picking them up The adult food was nothing to write home about We flew both ways from and to Sydney in June from Abu Dhabi on both legs we Paid for extra leg room to be in exit row was cold from doors so needed 3 blankets seats narrow so hard to get comfortable as no room to turn side wards or pull arm rest up between my husband and I improvement needed as food quality overall poor and insufficient for 13 hours consisted of 1 meal of noodles they have decent aircraft but staff and service is horrible the service in 380 not expected to be this horrible its shame to AIRBUS company service is horrible the food is blant without taste and appears to be have prepared more than 24 hours ago in toilet no moisturizers noâ Nobody would like to eat cold Pizza it took 15 min to get it plus the tray was with only hot food and water no salad or sweetie or even ask for my soft drink when i asked her about the restHostesses were lazy and unfriendly food was sparse and snacks charged for toilets left uncleaned despite hostess being told a father asked for the food to be served sooner because they were already late in serving and his kid was hungry and FA s reply was The food is reminiscent of the in flight food of the 70 s drinks served in very small amounts in cheap plastic cups The female stewardess was really unfriendly and rolled eyes at my mother when she didnâ t respond to her question on which food to eat because she was sleeping I had cold food that should have been hot and a truly diabolical food offer Little low quality food with a clear invitation to buy additional food later on the food seemed old and not well heated The only thing i would comment is that they stopped serving cheese with biscuits and I didn t know we had to order childrens meals for them as the airline knew their ages very disappointed about this and if I d have served meals to the poor standard to my customers I wouldn t have lasted 5 minutes in the industry I asked if i can get a regular meal instead and she refused to give me I d just like to say that the quality of the food and drinks served in the Economy cabin on your flights is appalling tasteless colourless and totally unappetising I had high expectations unfortunately the seats were cramped food wasn t exciting The cabin staff should really be more aware of how many drinks are being served Airline food has always been somewhat of a joke but on a long flight the meal and the snacks help to pass the time We booked two tickets husband and wife they allocated seat at two different row which is ridiculous if they want to sell eat selection they should at least keep the seats together in the same itineraryThe food was not to our tasteBuisness class was worse than any economy class I have ever used apart from comfortable seat inflight tv system not working lunch menu offered from 8am lights turned out as if night time flight from around 2 pm irish time The plane from Manchester to Abu Dhabi was spacious but the food poor with an offer to purchase additional during the 7 hr flight The small sandwiches they serve during the flight from Riyadh Abu Dhabi very very poor quality and looks very cheap They forgot to put out the head phones the phone charger didn t work on my seat or the other 2 seats they forgot my snack even though I re ordered it Food was not great choice was limited and you are expected to pay for snacks inâ Food very meagreWe were unable to go to other facilities as the food trolleys were in the aisle Only one meal during 14 hours and in order to get something to drink it took around 20 minutes minimum due to the lack of staff I ended up being sick for days when I got home as a result of undercooked food Delayed boarding at Sydney airport with staff asking us if we were willing to fly the next night instead due to overbooked plane Pre booked childâ s meal missing and â not registeredâ on first two flights reported both times Around 5 staff members led by one boss openly fighting on the open floor with each other Child screaming nearby for 14 total hours all good with meThe food on our first flight 14 hours was abysmal but nothing prepared me for our connectingâ The food on this flight wasn t appetizing for me as the flavour did not suit me however the return flight food tasted much better Repetitive food with no comfort pack or hot towels to freshen up anymore We couldn t even eat the bread rolls as they were frozen most of the vegetarians on that flightThe only problem was the airline food Food was terrible did not eat anything for any flight with Etihad Another disappointment on the flight was the food And food menu never changes it is the same for the last 5 years Serving food very slowly however it s a good thing that air hostess still had a smile to see and you get your meals early and don t have to worry about a third person After few hours i asked when food was going to be served as i had 2 small kids with me whom were hungry what I didn t like is that if you don t order the whole menu straight away you have missedâ No attention was given to us and we were made to feel we were interupting if wanting service or anything from their miserable snack menu A bit disappointed with the food choice Within few minutes of takeoffI had practically the same meal the food had no redeeming factors at all The service was terrible one drinks service with the hot meal on each flight There is no serving of salad and bread like beforeSurely the flight attendant knew I was not served any food Meals did not eat any on all four flights we took service on three of are flights where very poor and one flight very good The flight attendant is slow and rude food is cold and no taste over priced tickets I will make sure not to use this airline in the futureWe had to wait ages for a drink then our food was served immediately after we missed a few rounds of food I found the food to be less than adequate and ended up purchasing extra food I paid extra for more space which gives you more legroom but no difference in seat food etc Meal at beginning of flight was unpleasant The food on my last flight Bangkok Abu Dhabi was amongst the very worstMeals and variety were extremely poor compared to similar airlines The only big negative was the food probably the worst Iâ ve ever had One of the flight attendants from JFK to Abu Dhabi spilled hot coffee on my hand and didn t even say sorry Food was not to my liking but was regional cuisine during our flight they ran out of snacks knowing it was a full flight of people they should have prepared for this I regret this decision their service is sub par and the food is OK not great But I have noticed a marked deterioration in the standard of food The food quality served on the plan in economy class is not good and the staff service is normal On the flight my friend was presented with cutlery in a sealed package and on removing the packing food was still on the cutlery Stale bread rolls served cold 4 cubes of lamb served with a mound of rice little rolls with a tomato paste style sauce and a meat unknown to me or a chicken salad roll with no chicken or salad Having to pay for extra snacks if still hungry after the very meager portions of food served The meals are to say rubbish Once settled in the plane I spoke with staff about my brothers dietary needs only to be told they had no log of this and had no gluten free meals on board so I ended up being served my meal about 3 4 of an hour after the person seated immediately next to me on my left Food inedible had penne from Singapore to Abu Dhabi pathetic with very little micro chopped tomatoes some cheese sauce and found one tiny slice of mushroom food was mediocre and I kept having a problem with the inflight entertainment But inside flight male hostess service mind is not helpful and not feel polite with guests also non veg dishes not avilable once reach the middle raw of flight When I told them it was too hot and could I have the pasta insteadUnlike other flights I did not know what the food was until it was brought round and was disappointed with the choice I was unable to pre book my meals or make special requests because I had booked through a travel agent While the food and drinks offering has lowered in standard so have the fare priceDisinterested staff mush food awful seats hopeless website No enough blankets and food on flight The food is terrible the movies are very limited and not lots up to date movies from around the world It was disappointing to see that I received the same pasta dish at every single meal time to and from my destination The inflight services quality of food and the interiors are sulking the least to say There s a new menu of items to purchase and meal service has seriously dropped meals were tiny and food on the Syd Abu Dhabi leg was about the worst plane food I ve ever eaten an appalling main and no menuSlow attendants 2 hours to clear a away a meal tray Meals and variety were extremely poor compared to similar airlines Flight service is not the one to rave about neither is the food but all is quite acceptable The nearly 200 per person for the 3 hour leg got us frozen appetizers rubber chicken and very very slow service as with first leg The food is not as good as it used to be directly the meal was a disaster hopefully we had a meal at the airport not good but better than what was served on board but again the food was not tasty and cold One meal served after leaving Abu Dhabi then nothing for 10 hours Unfriendly staff I had the teriyaki chicken for our second meal and got food poisoning from it We were freezing in both flights our bags did not follow all the way to Ko Samui they stayed in BKK it was supposed to follow food is really not that great seats are not so comfortableThe food was average our rolls were a bit hard Food barely warm Having to pay for seats in economy that are uncomfortable to say the least the revolting slop they serve as a meal was totally inedible and not sufficient for a long haul flight obviously this is because they are now trying to get you to buy food from their new overpriced onboard menu wellOn the journey from Abu Dhabi we were moved on to an older aircraft with very narrow isles uncomfortable seats few toilets and once again not very palatable food Food was ok nothing special but the lite snacks were a nice touch The Crew were fine but the food was not the greatest I have problem with cheese Still missing coleslaw for breakfast was no loss The food was not excellent but also not bad In terms of service and meals it didn t blow me away but the seating on offer was very comfortable and worth it Check in was good going plane was virtually empty in our zone going food was ok nothing special I didnâ t have any worries with the foodOther than that the flight experience was OK but not as good as other airlines because of the food situation Never had such food Everytime they only gave you a small plastic glass water and there was only 3 4 times they supplied drink for a 9hrs flight and it s not their fault you even feel in business that they are cutting back on food Food no choice of food does not even have fruit for dessert badly cooked vwgw meala rating 1 I got my food last in my section again about 3 4 of an hour after the passenger on my left Food was not our taste Food is plain and tasteless The airline does not cater for people with Gluten intolerance or other food allergies I also noticed on my last trip that Etihad are now offering an option to buy extra food items Food was not great but not terrible either Having traveled on 4 flights to and from Australia to Manchester UK the meals classed as complimentary are of a poor standard for international flights They serve you beverage after one hour and no breakfast instead you are served lunch after 3 hours of flight time so that they can save money on food They did not carry any chicken dish to serve or they are out after serving very few rows Rest was fine apart from food Another hard seated Dreamliner couldn t sleep night flight food disgusting no drinks offered except a small bottle of water no alcohol offered at all and no juice soft drinks other than water Flying from Abu Dhabi felt sorry for the crew as the food on the menu was selectively loaded and so the prawn main dish was only one and the first passenger got it Above average flight even in code share company Tap Air Portugal not possible online check in for partner company in one of the almost seven hours flight only one meal do not agree to pay for choosing seats in Etihad plaid seat very hard and because of that not very comfortablesAll services both on board food and care and online poor website no link to sisters companies booking checking are under average and not representative of a 21st century airline company Your meals are barely edible your lounges are not what they were and even your chicken meal seems to be made from reconstituted proteinâ thereafter snacks or drinks have to paid for just like a budget airline think this sends then wrong signals out One run of the drinks trolley on a 13 hour flight and no one wandering around with water was a big disappointment as was the quality of the food Frozen food was being served and water in cheap plastic bottles You now only get one main dish with a bread roll and a muffin with a very limited choice of drinks and the most horrendous wine I ever tasted The food cant eat then i didnâ t order it since I had doubt its halal foodThis was my second time travelling with Etihad but so dissapointed with the quality and quantity of food as they just serve 2 small snacks with very tiny bottle of water Nothing offered service wise until 2 hours inflight meals are the hot dish a dry bread andHowever food and beverage service has taken a bashing cut backs on in flight services clearly apparent and inflight crews seemed flustered and under pressure i got to know that etihad is not providing fresh food all food been loaded from abu dhabiWe were spoiled by the excellent service of the crew both ways but the food wasn t exceptional But food is really discuting When we boarded the staff seemed very busy and we were offered a drink 15 minutes after boarding As for the food all the flights to and from India was tasteless and they put three cubes of fruit but we steered away from most of it however the food is very ordinary even for economy class It was crammed to the max with passengers and food was appalling Food was not worth a mention The food is the dinner again was a little bland meaning the meat Food is something you wonâ t miss in Etihad flights both for quality quantity and serviceI understand the good reviews people are writing but an airline service is not about the food speed or what they offer when everything is ok No choice for lunch or whatever it what supposed to be Staff were disinterested and food bland Coming back there was a problem with her meal but again the ground staff air stewards sorted this out Quite apart from the age and tatty condition of the plane the service was non existent and the food was just ghastly I just find the changes are too dramatic and even had to buy your own snacks now The food was appalling and served in tiny plastic dishes Food again was mediocre staff seemed to be busy as they never stopped and asked if we would like anything or top ups again after dinner Noticed something a bit strange with food service flight very rarely delayed craft always clean and food onboard consistently poor When I asked the lady if the sandwich is with Vegetables only or with Chicken because I want to be sure as I don t eat beefThe past few flights we experienced lack of food choice and food choice ran out and was served vegetarian though personally I don t mind as the vegetarian food tend to be less bland than the non vegetarian fares sometimes Only one meal service option during a 14 hour flight Apart from collecting the dinner trays there was no other offer of service no drinks no rubbish collection just nothing Food is lousy instead a chicken penne tomato pasta with salad was served at around 5am with no bread and no other option offered Even when we asked to purchase a second drink no one came back to us with said drink despite us ordering it The meal was OK but I didn t like the sandwich They woke us all at 4am for a snack then turned out the lights again A far cry from the steak sandwich in Biz a staple that is worthy of reserving They don t provide food drink menus in Economy anymore Only main course meal and a piece of cheap bread We were delayed in the heat with only one small drink offered We didnâ t see any crew after that throughout the whole flight they did not come round again to offer drinks until an hour before landing and it was almost an 8 hour flight they said it was chicken pie it was weak mashed potatoes with very small pieces of chicken and veg hidden inside no taste at all We were given two meals during our two flights each 6 hours aswell as snacks and drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic for no extra cost Food and Beverage the sandwiches served with tea were terrible and there was only one vegetarian option available no pastries etc were served with Tea and even if you wanted to pay for the these the only option availableThey ran out of non veg food the crew handling our section was extremely rude and mocked a fellow passenger Normally on an overnight flight you get at least a coffee and sandwich before landing not on this oneand she said she cannot replace it instantly that i needed to wait until everyone is given a meal When we asked for more food all they would give us were a tiny bag of dry crackers nothing else available and I just eat very bland food as my family say Food heaps fresher no stoggy bread I don t know why they serve cold croissants with Indian food tea and coffee is always coldâ Baby food was not available in fruits only vegetables and chicken seats were crampped staff were surly and had to be encouraged to privide drinks half the plane was partitioned off with no access we are small but the fellow next to us was about average sizeNo breakfast served unless specifically requested When i booked the flight i booked childrens meals as my kids dont like airplane food the staff Husbands chair was very wobbly food ok One dish was simply pasta with a very plain tomato sauce There is no in between meals food stacked somewhere for you to grab while itâ s available but you have to ask for it All and all I highly recommended the airline and offered services which an excellent value for your money Food is never good in economy but this sank to new depths No clue why some passengers get some snacks food dished out Following is the list of issues I faced right from time I boarded 1 Extermly unwelcoming n highly rude flight attendants 2 Very tiny food portions and only 1 times food was severd in 9 hours flights The plane was well used tray table needed maintenance the food ordinary and a beer hard to get When I asked for water he pointed to the small plastic container on the meal tray and told me I had thatbut I don t like the aroma or spice of the food I am not a fan or airline food and mostly skip it on short flightsThe kids were hungry and sleepy and by the time the dinner was served it was 11 15PM Not over generous with the drinks whiskey food was nothing special and the films were OK wouldn tFood sub par and small dishes and mostly tasteless Had to wait ages for a drink it seems a small thing meals served at odd times and the entertainment selection was appalling I know food on board is not always the best but what you got in the tray is unbelievable It was a snack packet with sandwiches and a kind of warm pizza and a little nuts bar I had requested a VGML but all passengers got similar packets and I never found a single piece of lamb in it even if the lamb had been found it was rather a disgusting tasting tomato and onion dish anyway Etihad should review travellers complaints and must take urgent measures to raise the quality of in flight meal refreshment one of the traveler asked the hostess for water and there was a rude answer saying that wait as water will be served after 15 mins with the snack meal and reply was a rude one After a long wait I was finally given a very poor quality tray of food Worse airline ever rude crew lousy food substandard entertainment The plane was old the seats were so uncomfortable the inflight entertainment was old difficult to use and of poor quality the services were unacceptable no menus on any of the flights on one flight we were passed a scrap of paper with the food choices written on it to pass on to the seat behind us the food was terrible the food choice we wanted was only available on two out of four of our flights small portions just a meal and a dry bread roll one drinks service no orange juice water services The service was slow as it took a couple of hours to get our dinner We were told that the beef dish was all gone and the only choice was either a spicy chicken dish or a fish dish which I am unable to eat Can t be really serious serving a chocolate bar at 5am The flight attendant said that they do not serve hot meal for shortâ The food was almost entirely inedible What food they did give us in the ticket price which wasn t much There is no option called Chicken meal It seemed like asking for an additional non alcoholic drink was a chore and they couldnâ t be bothered this aspect of the flight was better on the return journey I wish for such a long flight two hot meals are served nd at Toronto airportIn fact I m quite a fan of Etihad food even if the menu seems to be mostly a choice between the chicken and the vegetarian Food in economy class isnt great and they do not provide free layovers even if your layover stay is 12 hours like ours was No alternatives due to lack of food they almost pushed me to choose only one dish and this was from crew dish and during the long flight no breakfast selection Booked for Asian vegetarian food could not get it Standard of food was unbelievably bad The only little hiccup was some uneasy service especially from one young male air hostess who made some unwelcoming childish jokes on me when I was about to aboard the air craft and later by insisting coffee at my table although it was politely refused and later protested This review applies to all 4 legs of my journey so unfortunately the food was not just a once off disaster Mu daughter is vegetarian and her food was a little bland as they made it vegan Everything about their service be it food in flight entertainment comfort is just so average Nice company but the service the meals beverages on board very poor compare to other airlines Firstly they told me Hindu meal is not available even after mentioning it specifically while booking I just put a 4 stars because lately the food quality and options went really down The food was a real catastrophe small portion without any test meat wasn t cook i tried many Air linesThe flight started well champagne and nuts served on boarding and my dinner menu taken that was the end of any service for the next 3 5 hours no offer of any drinks water and no sign of any food I was forced to ask specifically for our drinks and desert at the same time meanwhile the rest of business class was finished eating and working on their after dinner drinks I did not because by chance I had some food in my cabin bag Etihad now sell a Sweet and Savoury selection resulting in a bland and bare minimum complimentary meal service So aside from the general underwhelming quality of the flight and the one service food provision 5 of an hour into a 7 hour flight I m really here to talk overbooking when it came to order food the response was sorry we have run out of that what only a few passengers andyou would think they could spend more than a fiver on the food On board entertainment not a big offer Food and drink service was rather poor you don t get a lot to drink The first 3 1 2hr flight to Brisbane provided no meals which we were not expecting but were able to eat at Brisbane No fruits or salad or cheese Spicy chicken noodles or bland tomato pasta I dont drink alcohol while flying but I wonder if they wouldâ ve able to heat something up for me so that I could have a hot meal or something more filling than a hand ful of nut free granola bars that Iâ d be forced to bring with me My wife requested for tea as the child as was hungry as the last meal was over 6 hours earlier Economy class experience is worst particularly the quality of the Veg food We even tried to change my wifes food choice that failed too it was a long flight in relatively comfy seats the food was OK not fantastic but certainly not bad Drink service was slow and cabin crew seemed crabby and resentful of any requests 11 hours after departure the flight attendant offered me a coffee or pastry which I declined as I said was still waiting to be served lunch Plain penne only with little cheese sauce and some unnoticeable tiny diced tomatoes too tiny for babies with only one tiny sliced canned mushroom in it Unfortunately it happened again no meal 4 second leg same thing happened again and my wife had to order a sandwich with a piece of cake guess what 8 hours later the food still hadnâ t arrived After take off on the eight hour flight we were given a sandwich with no bar round at all and woken three hours out of MAN and given a hot breakfast which is way to early just a main meal with a bun that is rock hard The flight was unremarkable but once again the crew were unfriendly food was uninspiring and entertainment options limited and cut off prior to landingThen when no ongoing flight was available for us the male counter attendants didnt give a toss sending us away from the counter with a meal voucher TWICE Now and I donâ t blame the flight crew for this a flight beyond 6 hours should include at least one proper meal and a snack thatâ s more substantial than crackers couple of cookies I and many other families dnt have food onThe food and service on the flight was very basic and not of bad quality ansThere was nothing actually wrong with food and beverageAs you already have my money why would you on a 14hr 40min flight understanding its evening hardly offer beverages etc During return on the longer way from BRU to AUH we were told that we had to book meals and the crew didn t provide us any food We had to arrange dinners as we had to wait much longer than planned Service is so bad you should abstain from drinks and food I had heard so much about how good this airline was WRONG service was terrible food average and the experience at checkin especially at JFK was not good Very heavy meals The range of entertainment was unimpressive the food was absolutely dreadful verging on inedible even a member of the cabin staff was laughing at the snack offering at the end of the flight into London the staff member who checked us in in Abu Dhabi was verging on incompetent and the overall experience was very disappointing and I found myself waiting a considerable time between the main course and dessert to the point they forgot my order and did not fill my glass with wine when empty Having a dietary issue is difficult but they were on point when it came to delivery of food Also warm snack compared with Etihad s boring cheese salad rolls amenities toothbrush toothpaste socks lip cream Worse meals were minimal and fairly uninteresting i dont understand what water has to do with meal time The in flight meals were bland with very limited choice For a business class ticket this type of service and lack of meal preparation is absolutely unacceptable â especially for a 16 hour transatlantic flight On the way to Morocco from Abu Dhabi the meal for my wife was given to someone and they only had to arrange for a make up meal which was not a good experience I donâ t eat spinach and Iâ m allergic to the tomato in the cheese sandwich Little better than a budget airline due to free food and drinks uoi could not fault their entertainment service and food was somewhat better than most plane food it needs to go through so my expectations are not high however the rolls were rock hard food was extremy watery but the desserts were actually quite tasty The bulkhead tvs were not working stewardesses were snobbish food was average after about an hour we were offered a hot or cold drink and then given a paper bag containing cheese roll a roll with cooked peppers cold both disgustingly bad a tiny packet of cheesets and biscuit It was an ok flight overall food was satisfactory my only complaint was the entertainment system I kept losing the sound to every movie that I tried to watch The food menu looked very good but the reality was the food was poor The meal at the start was lamb which I tried on the flight over it was terrible or the vegetarian option being the penne pasta of the chicken The food was not of the same standard as other airlines with the choice running out along way before the end Food and beverage service cannot be faulted The food offer is laughable and the entertainment package severely lacking As with most air lines there were no menus in cattle classMy sandwich is actually soggy can I have another one asked the woman in front of me The male staff Food Beverage Managers Etihad Airways is rude and force us to choose the menu I like the on time schedule of this Airline It s also comfortable and have number of routes but the quantity of food provided for connection flight is too less and hardly offer drinks I did not like the food quality at all it needs so much improvement The food selection was not that goodVegetarian food was good but in return flight from Jfk vegetarian food selection was like muted and it was very cold Meals are drab justwe found the food to be not as good as previous flights Firstly there were no welcome drinks and snacks on either flightMy only criticism is that the app messed us around on our vegetarian meal option when we booked online but the air hostesses were quick to find a solution During meal service there was no menu given to refer to and the electronic one was empty A cabin crew member came and spoke with my brother and organised some fruit and offered scrambled egg which he could take off the bread and eat my brother turned this down due to possible cross contamination which would make him very ill Main meals tough small portions no taste snacks completely inedible Yucky stinking toilets average food and unfriendly staff Dinner was fine but the vegetarian rolls served during the night were hard with almost no filling somehow no Asian veg meals under my wifeâ s name yet mine still had it No food before landing I walked of the plane hungry where near the alleged 32 inch leg room the food was dire the service was poor and all in allThe first leg from Paris apparently you dont get a toiletry bag even though the flight is 7hrs nor did they explain items on the menu It would have been better if they could have served meals at shorter interval as most guests were hungry guess what they DIDNT serve me my meal â The drinks service was utterly unlimited Iâ ve no idea how the guy beside me was able to walk off the plane The return flight was similar poor basic foodThe flight itself requested a drink mid flight and waited about 30 45 minsEtihad is almost like an LCC you have to pay for seat selection and even food onboard But recently I was surprised that the meal was only served once for 9hr flight but I do not like food what they have The Flight is a long one and they serve Only two meals Food was mediocre No service for soft drinks when food was eventually served and staff then disappeared and whilst I do not drink alcohol a lot the offering of drinks was non existent other than with mealsit was an almost 7 hours trip with only one 1 serve of food I could not fault them snd the food was average but filling The food was like all other airline food bland Less leg room than the average 737 food tasteless except for the raw apple and cabin crew all but disappeared apart from when serving meals or selling duty free The food service started and my first disappointment arose as my booked meal choice of Asian Vegetarian did not appear Wasn t offered a menu at the start of the flight so didn t know what we were getting and if you did want any extra snacks they were not free you had to pay for them I found the Food to be very average and poor the entertainment system was not much better other than that everything was fine Staff very helpful and Friendly but remember its a 7 5 Hour Flight average drinks are not much better notâ Drinks were few and far between and on a long haul it shouldn t be necessary to keep going to the galley for glasses of water I did not eat meal for 8 hours as they ran out of vegetarian meals I already placed a request for Hindu vegetarian meal but they donâ t care The first thing she said was that If you don t preselect your meal we cannot guarantee you would get a meal of your choice No snacks and it all seemed like too much effort for the cabin crew Very poor in flight service they ran out of meal selections during every meal Their inflight meal is real horrid there were no salads no dessert drinks service abysmal and apathetic cabin crew intolerable and lousy at their job do not come when summoned it s their jobIf you plan to fly any long haul flight with the airline I would suggest a hearty meal before hand or you will land at your destination hungry as we did not so good was the Meal Service My fellow passenger asked to be served breakfast 1 hour before landing already a stretch I thought but the flight attendant didn t come until 30 minutes before landing so she had to decline the mealthe moment the flight attendants announced that they have snack buy option I had realised that I am not going to get real food here Same arriving in Sydney except no choice a chicken and pasta meal Etihad has small meals portions which are not really enough to feed you tastes awfully bad and snacks are almost non existent or portioned as if it weighs in GOLD and when I rechecked forgot came the answer and found the Asian veg meal we ordered no different than in economy and a refill of my drink was never done Asked for some butter to go with our cheese and biscuits and was told there wasn t any Check in at Manchester was a shambles food on the outward leg was average no more and on the return leg non existant and they did not have enough meals and didâ No little vanity packs so no eye masks water not offered in bottles drinks served with meal so nothing to drink prior to dinner dinner very basic no salad no dessert The only way that generally an airline is judged by most people is seat comfort and food â Most restricted refund fare rule applies in the event that different fare choices are combinedâ and that my flight is not eligible for cancellation since I â automatically agree when booking a flightâ The food stuff is not good and so is the seating Very uncomfortable seats on Airbus 380 for first leg of our journey Food average white wine not very coldThe rest of the sector from Abu Dhabi to Kochi was unremarkable and the food served on return flight home to London was just average The hostess who was looking after our section of the aircraft was very bland and never smiled nor offered water throughout the 6 hour flight other than at meal service but it wasn t a bad choice airline needs to improve free wifi services I didn t like the food as well but my overall experience was good Airline food is universally mocked for being generally unpalatableThe food served was not all good for consumption The cold snack rolls served are filled with some no descript fillings that has been spread wafer thin anyway and not very nice tasting perhaps a cake nothing fresh when main meal came out Predictably by the time she got to me they had run out of food choiceJust one concern I may be wrong but it is felt that offer of alcoholic beverages to economy class passengers is not very forthcoming which I believe is a concern with most airlines The food was terrible mince and soggy salad caramel popcorn for snack and powdered milk for tea Coffee was a wee bit too dark even with 2â Anyway I settle in and drinks are served and suddenly hear a lady in her mid 30sI wasn t offered any other food or drink The service was a bit better the food just as uninspiring as on the way out and the packaging was a smorgasbord of unrecyclable black plastic trays with plastic film lids To get a drink you walked to the back of the plane where a lazing and disinterested hostess pointed to a row of half filled cups of water Meals were not great Limited liquor and alcoholic beverages in economy class they serve only once More than enough food and some can order at anytime not like Emirates do not offer anything like this anymore My wife has food allergies so we opted for Vegetarian Oriental she got insipid vegan meals Not much of a selection foodwise mostly biryani on the return flight we did have a meal slightly different which wasn t too bad meals were fine nothing really special though Service was lacking had to get my own 2nd drink Is it too much also to ask that when someone asks for a can of soft drink that they are given the can and not half its contents No amenity kit for a night flight no cold drinks being offered other than when food is being served I flew business class from Edinburgh to Abu Dhabi few days back the food quality has really gone down However the meal itself is not in a big serve people like me find it not thatâ Pre ordered meal turned out to taste like dead cockroach None of the meals I had on any of the flights was remarkable Films a bit boring food very good We had to opt for different meals not something you expect after paying for a business class flight so couldnâ t do anything about it yes I could have put overhead light on but why when it was broad daylight outside and I am sure most peoplesâ body clocks were on tea time not night time I like neither lamb or pesto pasta so I politely declined the meal and just asked for a drink no dessert or fruit not even a small water tub I have never come across this combination of a complimentary and a chargeable meal Since the food was so bad on the way out we bought additional food Furthermore service was poor little food was served and not enough water provided but once meals were finished there wasn t much sign of any staff offering further drinks or snacksâ request for water and alcoholic beverage for second time was never answered finally before landing the senior cabin lady came and in not a very friendly mannerFood quality even in Business Class is mediocre Talking about being greedy Some drinks during the flight are now offered for extra cost There is no rolling menu while the flight The snacks are equally pitiful however drinks continue to be generous in frequency When the meal service arrived the people in front did not get the food they had ordered service on board and the food selection is not the best and on my return leg for Abu Dhabhi the air hostess was extremely unhelpful and appeared totally unhappy serving business class passengers Although a scheduled 2 hour layover I had only time for a quick shoer and not even a drink We left Abu Dhabi at 320 am and it was not until 7 h later that a measly meal was served Only issue in spite of mentioning at the time of booking for Vegetarian Hindu Meal we were served with pasta salad on both the flights Had a sandwich and breakfast no other drinks offered during the flight Overall I found the Etihad onboard experience satisfactory but lacking in their food beverage offerings Food was average on this sector what surprised me was the lack of amenity kits Meals where probably as good as any in economy but the snack was not great at all and although plane was not at all full the service seemed slow and also there was no separate drink services you had to ask for drinks soft drinks in our case which was a bit of a shame it s cram food are way too overpriced With no offer of a drink either There is absolutely no excuse to have to endure a thirteen hour flight without a meal All the trays in our row were sloping towards us which meant the tray and drinks kept sliding off 5 Drink service no alcohol was only offered 1 time in the 8 hours from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi only 2 times in the 15 hours from Abu Dhabi to NYC I was lead to believe there would be pamper packs there wasn t there was a blanket pillow I also was lead to believe there would be 2 meals there wasn t Teas and coffee were barely filled to half a small cup I got out of my seat and went to the crew area and asked for one more drink if that s possible because your co worker said we re not serving right now There is no meal Menu and Last meal is vegetarian by default The stewardess was not helpful when I pointed out that my meal was sliding off the tray The only thing I would grumble about is that they were not very forthcoming with the drinks and did not have Baileys which you can get on Emirates Best thing about this flight was the shortest time Melbourne to Athens but more expensive than last year we flew the same time was OK but nothing to rave about some of the food not the best would have preferred just a sandwichNot much in the food choices either I pressed the service light for a drink waited 5 minutes and noticed the light had been switched off Cold drinks are not at all cold My sister has celiac and we requested a gluten free meal This time I was sitting in a crammy chair I had to pay for seat reservation the food was not even worth 1 star I wouldn t recommend the food on boardAfter booking you will notice to get spammed by emails to upgrade seat select choose meals or other services all to high prices There was also a cheap chocolate bar with them At least gave some snacks and no kit for refresh such as toothbrush and tooth pasteService forgets to serve breakfast Didn t enjoy the meal at all because of this defect so for food they provide snacks in which given the sandwich to everyone and there s no other option Food was a little better than average and ok but airline food never is brillant we were sat in the dark for all three flights light only coming on when food call it thatThis is second time I m traveling in ethihad flight economy class is the same as other airlines so there is something to compliment food is average service is very slow air hostess showing their face towards me and not at all kind first time seeing air hostess like this They have no idea what ingredients are contained in their meals andWhen the snack cart came around later I asked for my purchased items and staff were clueless Onboard meal also very standard not special like another 5 stars I was flewFlew Etihad from Paris to Abu Dhabi to Sydney seats in economy is hard and uncomfortable food served is basically inedible lamb and rice for dinner was fat and rice chicken meal was very spicey sandwiches served were far to hot and spicey for the average person snacks consisted of a bag of popcorn not everyone likes popcorn coffee and tea basically non existent breakfast on the Sydney leg consisted of a sweet scroll and custard and a chocolate bar like a kit kat I requested for a warm water no not the kids meal which they never provide in flight even if they know infants are traveling for my kid s celeracTo add insult to injury cabin crew came up to me saying here is your Kosher meal again not ordered by me Yes we were offered food vouchers hardly any outlets served gluten free items and a monetary amount of compensation can only be redeemed on an Etihad flight within the next 12 months would we really want to take advantage after this fiasco I didn t feel the meals were authentically Arabic and the vegetarian pasta dish that I chose for my diner was extremely bland No butter no cheese and biscuits They were nowhere to be found only emerging when foods are served Breakfast with no cheese no marmalade For a 9hr flight having noodles or pasta is just cheap Food poisoning on both journeys that left me incapacitated for days afterwards Food was average as compared to Geneva Abu Dhabi sector No alcohol served in economy class Service on the flight was efficient food not too thrilling butNo food options available as when I asked for the wafflesâ so the last thing we needed was alcohol before breakfast I m sure that the decline in quality of the food and the introduction of paid for snacks is no coincidence they be have low cost for a high privÃ no choicee of seats no choice of meal seat distance in 777 too small no european rights of passengersNow they offer some poor sweet and sour payable food option then when you ask for a choice of item it is not onboard The service is average not much of food choices There were some issues on the return flight some of which were out of the airline staff control not enough non vegetarian meals The menu was vey limited for business class but to order your meal when you wanted it was a great experience there was also available snacks on demand Food did not agree with me and my companions This airline does not allow you to use online check in change your seats or change your meals if you do not book directly with them Me and my wife are vegetarians and we had to skip all our meals in the flight I was only offered 1 coffee the whole 14hrs and 40min No second drink no desert wine offered And the quality of food is not good i was served breakfast after asking twice which was completely inedible is one of the top airline but after this flight I will prefer to travel with anyother airline as its not about that a passenger didn t get a proper food Again we found the quality of meals disappointing not as good as previous flights with Etihad I was given sea food meal which is generally allergic and with choice had to eat which tasted too poorN as for drink I better not comment Cups of tea coffee were about 2â in depth and tasted disgusting and the food not much better Service was pretty good on most of the flights though one or two of the cabin crew were a bit offhand when I asked for a coffee outside of the normal service time We also noticed the hostesses never seemed to offer any extra drinks water or otherwise Its not enough and inspite of Making request for Vegetarian Meals we were told that they dontâ they are very sorry to hear about my experience and are changing the portion size of the meals I could not understand the hostess even after asking 3 times what the meal options were Service has drastically changed over the last year So stringent about weight food servicesI find now plastic knifes and forks small serving trays with little or no food on it allâ no butter no desserts no jams for the bread The type food in the lounge was same as two years ago they have not changed the menu we were a little tired bec coming in from Athens airport which has pretty long walks to gate tiny and cramped they give more space to the shops and restaurants at airport There were four main meal choices on the menu in business class including salad and pasta neither of which I particularly fancy yet the two hot dishes were both â soldJust about got settled when the cabin crew came round with the well still frozen sandwiches Firstly beyond the first order for food and a drink within the first few minutes of the flight nothing else was offered The food was alright at lunch and dinner however the breakfast was hard to swallow and could do with a bit of fine tuning No food vouchers just a shrug if you have a coffee no salad or starter nothing and that is because they serve food nothing else Seats flatbeads not as good nor food Food service was again efficient but meals were forgettable 14hr flight was delayed by 3hrs we sat in the plan for 17hrs that too with a 2year old no food no water service was terrible the attitude that air hostess have is even worst Throughout the entire flight no snacks tea or coffee or even water offered Some meals were cold others inedible and once mine was delivered with no plastic cutlery had to wait for a long time and crew member thought funny as he handed out to other people too Decided to use American Airlines mileage to travel to Abu Dhabi and this was truly worst flight albeit of having travelled over 3 million miles globally As an executive platinum on AA you still get no benefit like on other one world alliance partners no check in options or boarding preference Food options were vegetarian only for 2 of the 3 meals as flight attendant told us itâ s now airline standard for this flight sandwich offered had some green vegy that was inedible Small video screens very limited entertainment selection small mediocre food portions The food onboard is also not good toâ The aircraft had the same entertainment system as the 1st flight and again our main meal was served before the rest of the flight The tray is small but the food quality was not too bad Buffet dining only now the glory days of A LA Carte are over with the cutbacks but I needed a Gluten free meal all arranged as required Passengers served their meal when I asked for mine Nothing supplied Traveller 24hours with nothing to eat Hostesses very apologetic but could do nothing We were not given a menu but were just asked on the spot if we wanted a chioice of one of two very cheap meal options No pre dinner drinks were served and the main meal was served at just after 11 15 am Also they rarely gave us drinks food was average not that good Q and E They just come up slightly short in the hospitality section no I can t give you a drink now we are serving food shortly 45 minutes later the food comes round no menu cards no menus on screen etc Planes are getting old Food options are getting smaller seat leg room is small One of my fellow passenger slept when they were serving the food when she got up in about an hour or so she was hungry but the hostess told her quite clearly that nothing is available and we are finished with food I am not a fan of being given drinks from a communal bottle and this exacerbated the aggravation Still no meal How many airlines give passengers individual bags with the menu an eye mask ear buds and a disposable tooth brush with toothpaste the aircraft was small and a bit run down there were cracks on the top side near the video screen in the economy class seat in front of me the video screen was small and the entertainment choice limited as well as the food service Besides the extremely tied space even for smaller people there was only one drink offer during the night flight she said she doesn t have veg option If you wanted something like a meal you had to chase it up or go without the cabin was kept in darkness the whole trip We asked for an additional sandwich which we were told was not available on this flight I feel that I was not looked after accordingly as not once after the initial meal was servedvery disappointed not the business class service iâ m used to unfriendly staff very average meals No food again I had ordered Gluten free food and it was incredibly dull and tasteless I also thought lunch would arrive around three hours later as that is what was stated when I ordered But the surprise was that after the long flight there was no announcement we were close to landing offering a snack or at least a cup of coffee before arrival so so late and the gluten free meal i d requested for was abysmal Bread roll no butter croissant for breakfast with no butter or jam And when you land from Paris to Abu Dhabi in the night flight no breakfast nothing to eat in economy We were starving with no food at out disposal In flight service was very good with charming flight attendants but the food and drink quality was not as good as it was The 6 places bar located between 1st Business classes is not a bar is not comfortable is a place to go wait for an attendant to come order the drink and get back to your seat easier to call the attendant from the seat No soft drinks No juices and No tea coffee service Don t have much choice for foodNegatives Food quality quantity Attitude service of cabin crews Online check in option is complicated Between 24 48 hours prior to departure paid seats need to be booked â The flight should make the holiday One meal on each flight Ist meal Lamb Rice Roll with no butter Chocolate Brownie no fruit or savoury dish no water or juice trolley followed behind offered hot andâ Food not great entertainment average The mains were ok no choice of how meat was to be presented Meals and drinks were ok felt slightly budget by getting a half full plastic cup of soft drink rather than a full can An evening meal was served probably the worst food I have ever had on a long haul flight However after serving for one time no one bothered to follow up if I need anything more as I only selected to eat one item out of many other options in Ala carte menu Hardly able to come by serving drinks again after meals then no more food Cinnamon Roll offered for 10 hours Etihad was a good flight in the sense check out and check in was quite fast but the food was not good quality at all compared to Emirates and also the movies were not as great Here is why Etihad has smaller legroom ares no food choice serving our seats as the last one with only one meal choice out of three at the beginning very slow check in not the best in flight entertainment all flights were delayed multi stop flight Food not good and lack of drinks and amenity kits If I have to nit pick would have liked it maybe 20 less salty am on a bland diet these days Not bothering to get back to me and not serving the soup at all was very unprofessional and does not represent the brand that Etihad is trying to portray Food was fully compromise with cheap food and breakfast sandwiches was useless as well coffee I will not recommend at all Staff are really rude food average and comfort really basic you are lucky no food choicesI thought the quality of service and seat comfort would be the same sadly I was mistaken Emirates offers more space better inflight entertainment and meal service plus other touches like a hot flannel However when it comes to consistency and the quality of the flight there are fluctuations for example flights to Middle Eastern countries do lack in quality the food sometimes in need of dire help the food not worth talking about the staff were lovely little things disappear and other things have now started to appear 1 hot towel and sweet before take off disappeared 2 complimentary eye mask socks toothpaste brush on over night flights disappeared 3 menu provided just after takeoff to advise of in flight meals disappeared 4 free as already paid for in the cost of the flight ð The flight from Abu Dhabi to Rome was even worse the main meal was two tiny rolls with almost no filing delivered in a paper bag no choice at all Itâ s very challenging these days to rate airplane food business class or otherwise I have travelled both Emirates and Etihad this was my first experience with Etihad Business Class after travelling both Emirates and Etihad Business Class I would rate the service with Emirates to be much better in terms of plane and food Etihad is ok on long haul however the food and the menus when compared to Emirates is not as good finally after 30 mns after start of service the cabin crew informed me that my food was wrongly given to another passenger and now all Hindu meals are exhausted Really Etihad not enough soup in business Very small very limited food beverage selections no entertainment options and NO WIFI Before it was a decent set of food now it is almost a HALF smaller main dish piece of bread on cheap foam plastic tray There was totally nothing awful about my experience but by the same token absolutely nothing impressive very tight seating very unremarkable food staff were pleasant enough Etihad Airways definitely needs to revise their meal option for this leg Being told it s chicken or lamb or pasta Business class is very very bad not food not services and not amenities like pigiamaâ The majority of the food options werenâ t available they said they ran out within just a few hours after takeoff I was told that l had to specify special meal if l did not want the muffin next time l fly with them and we were served one tiny meal albeit tasty it was just not sufficient The meals onboard was ok too not too bad No menu snacks were only serve at a certain time I did get a Vegetarian meal just not what I had booked The seats were unconfortable even on just a 6 hour flight and the food drink service not comparable with others who fly this route Flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi over 7 hrs flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne over 14 hrs staff not attentive despite only being 100 people on the first leg asked for a particular drink nothing special just a ginger ale to be told they only had one can for the entire flight The food service on our flight prior to this one was good on this particular flight the service and food offered was poor Can t get over their cheese platter No breakfast Old looking aircraft If anything they just skipped the appetizer and delivery my main meal Food not brilliant very unimaginative Our intention was to have dinner onboard even though it was a late departureIf they didn t have vegetarian then why they give option to select meal The service was exceptional on Etihad I require gluten free food and the cabin crew could not so enough to ensure my food was free of gluten but still tasty But if you are still hungry which you may well be you are afforded the opportunity to BUY snacks or additional food I found the service almost non existent the food almost inedible and the staff did not seem to be engaged Awful service limited leg space no food choices The business class lounge at Abudhabi Shockingly unkempt and resembled a local market with loud chatter restrooms not maintained well and some buffet options which I did not even bother to check The lounge food is not very delicious and don t have a lot of variety Crew were not providing enough drinks and we were getting very dehydrated Contrary to the practice in some of the carrier which stock snacks at certain locations for passengers to help themselves in long flights Emirates had none The staff were embarrassed later order steak sandwich from snacks and you guessed it Can t faulty the service quality of food served and punctuality of the 4 flights I took on this return trip The main meals they served were fine not exceptional but perfectly acceptable Kids received their kids meals in a cute little box which had a mask you could tear out I have never known these food types to be served at breakfastCabin crews not approachable did not have the choice of meal meal was just handed over without even explaining the content One of our party expected cheese and biscuits Unless I read that Etihad do away with the underhanded advertising of cost and hidden seat expenses and if they change their menu and upgrade their standard of food I will not use this airline again Unlike other top notch airlines there was no customary introduction by the service manager the flight attendants lacked hospitality no sleeper suits on the ultra long haul flights including one overnight one limited menu choices after she gave me the meal and everyone in the economy classIt was also odd the flight attendant had to check if there was enough soup onboardThe bread roll had been heated to a hard rock the fruit cup was stale and soggy and the butter container was already opened The quality of food was not good and never seems to change The white skin travelers are treated quite well offered empty seats first in case of their meal options are not available sometimes they are offered from Business First Class meals Not having flown Etihad for a while we were very disappointed in the whole business class experience Both are flights were night flights but no slippers or pyjamas the gift pack is a joke better not give anything the food choice and quality wasquestionable dinner was minimal and lacked any imagination 27 hours of flying with one meal is pretty redundant I have taken other airlines on similar segments and they serve warm food on such occasions even in economy class I actually skipped one meal because I was too full It is not very hard to create vegetarian meals I should think AVML meal options are very ordinary and tasteless Not much choice of authentic arab foods Staff were very pleasant but on both legs when I ordered my meal there was no serving of the cheese course The important things with etihad never ever try long transit at Abu Dhabi airport not same as another 5 stars airlines they will give u meal voucher or transit hotel lounge voucher but etihadI didn t get the meal optionMost of all there was no much drink quantity on offer I had requested they wake me up one hour before landing to have my breakfastNo option for kidney friendly diet low sodium and low potassium We were also expecting better food quality coming out of Japan only to be disappointed with subpar quality and selection toilets were not cleaned during the trip meal quality is okay but delivery is appalling My surprise was to find completely the opposite the flight attendants are absolutely not kind the food is small and they do not serve water during night as all otherâ The choices were lamb sausage and egg or chicken sausage and egg I opted for lamb sausage and it was hard and cold along with the egg omelette soFor example my meal was served before landing and the intervals were so long that my coffee took more than 15 minutes to arrive after ordered i managed to have my small meal with no help Also having to duck as they swing their treys trying to figure out who s special meal they have is another thing shouldn t that be rule oneâ In the morning we expected a breakfast and had none I changed it back to a normal meal which was a little better I am allergic to garlic and couldn t find a way of putting a garlic allergy in but the guy was helpful on the phone and suggested a bland meal for these things which worked well on all legs They couldn t serve the food option requested at the time if booking Asked for a note to be added to file stating but allergy as they do not offer that notation on special meal request dropdown menu For a meal I made my complaint all ready to the company in business there are lie flat seats meals toiletry bags the new ones are not as useful where is the lip balm I wish I had of just picked from the all day dining menu Their cabin staff on both flights Singapore to AUH and AUH to JFK was downright rude to the point where I didn t dare ask for a drink or any other assistance as they were snappy and sassy I liked the food on demand concept however the entertainment was lacking and the quality of food in business class was pretty average Had dinner but breakfast was not offered which I found strangeOn my flight from Brussels due to the long queuing for the passport control I couldn t enjoy the lounge and have my breakfast and pil against fear of flying so I informed the flight attendant if I could have some water However found it strange that after the first meal the snacks and drinks were up for sale and nothing more The hostesses did not offer drinks enough like they do on other airlines Their on board food is not great and on my return l made sure l had my own food Unfriendly staff dinner terrible choice tasted awful at least you feel comfy to sit for a long haul flight food is fine and not too bland Food is awful they served Indian food with hot spices as breakfast After lots of recent cuts with Etihad No chauffeur no pjs no toiletry pack in economy lounge food no longer a la carte and drinks at bar not table service i wold have expected a breakfast meal arriving in Abu Dhabi 6 30am not choice of chicken or egg and spinach sandwich I pre ordered a gluten free meal but my dinner on the first flight and lunch on my connecting flight were the same My wife asked for some pastries for her coffee she was flatly told that there were no more In flight food options are limited at the best of times when flying economy The breakfast they served was something in a wrap it was horrible I requested the cabin crew for a cake which was part of the menu and there was a harsh reply from them that they dont serve it for special meals The seats were also extremely uncomfortable On the upside the food was fine as was the the service In the end for all of my meals I had to chase down an attendant admittedly they did refill my wine with dinner but nothing after that breakfast took 40 minutes to arriveThe latest trip Bangkok from Manchester was mediocre on so many levels the planes 777 s were old and looking worn out the food was truly inedible the inflight entertainment system needs updating more oftenbut I was not really impressed with the meals except the breakfast eggs and sausage you can t go wrong so 40 uncomfortable minutes in a hot craft on the runway should have had drinks a lot quicker If I hadnâ t had a few snacks of my own I would have spent close to 18 hours without any food that was it until approx 1 hour from Abu Dhabi when we were given a coffee or tea either a small pack of savoury snacks or a couple of biscuits food was not that good and did not relate to time of travelNo food selection everyone got rice and beans both measls duringâ One breakfast was simply a wrap which was a snack not a meal which is below standard for a long haul flight Breakfast disgusting some sort of scrambled eggs This has gone down the hill in customer service airport services travel quality and even food Felt really let down by all this it s not like I can leave the restaurant and go somewhere else Food was actually pretty good too for an airline clearly difficult to match up meals to time zones on different flightsSeats uncomfortable meals were the same old entertainment system In 14 plus horse flight you are served lunch to begin with after another 4 hours you are given cold sandwiches which is cold and another lunch 2 hours before with a weird combination of chicken pasta and Mediterranean taboulleh and hammus salad with no bread or dessert There were no cheeses or crackers or small chocolates like other airlines Special meals were either not heated properly or quite inedible For a nine hours flight we were served only one santwich and coffee refreshments 2 hours after taking off and a breakfast before landing at Abu Dabi airport Also seats on that plane not so comfortableProper steel cutlery but no individual menu as folk lore rumoured All the flights were comfortable on time and food was mostly excellent although we had a hot vegetable rolled pastry thing which was pretty rank the only bad thing out of all the meals snacks It was also marred by the fact that the lights were out for most of the journey and only turned on for meals which is something I ve never experienced beforeWe had a meal initially after a few hours which was ok but then had to wait for 7 hours for the next which was breakfast That was a bit confusing for me especially as l was expecting breakfast on board Food not wonderful infact a rey limited choice and no amenity kitNo Breakfast was served coming into Sydney early morningNo printed menuNo kid meal provided Almost the same on 2 consecutive flights not heated enough no bread with breakfast Upon filling in their questionnaire the response back felt rather formletterand that yes indeed it was on file despite being told otherwise on board and they advised I should bring my own food in future for the 14 hour journeyWater offered very infrequently during a 7 hr flight 1 meal only no snacks such as fruit etc available from galley did get offered candied popcorn However the staff from Abudhabi to New York was not so caring I ordered a special meal but was not given despite requesting Also food quantity and quality not up to the mark A snack of sorts was brought later in the afternoon I d had experience of these wraps before so didn t bother thats finished now The A380 is a very smooth quiet trip however the on board service and food is nowhere near as good as it used to be Meals Average Food served absolutely chilled biting into a muffin almost gave my tooth a shock An hour before we landed tea or coffee was given out again The few of us who had been served breakfast were told to just throw the trays under the seats put the tray table up and wait and it would have been good to have a written menu to look it over beforehand as te meals were not explained well by the staff eg one meal Lunch was served will never ever travel in this airlineNot good selection of beer Bud or Stella Out of choice will not be using Etihad again Food is good and the service is secnd to none No menu and very limited choice for dinner No menus of options are handed out The food and snacks were plentiful and good if you re not too much of a fussy eater The sweet cake offered is very dry and bland Breakfast was a muffin and drink nothing else Red wine is really below average any wine drinkers can easily reject the red wine serving in Economy class I will not talk about serving lunch in the morning instead of the breakfastYet again another journey this time 14 hours with no meals more cups of tea could have been a bit more proactive in their approach the green fibres from their blanket gave a carpet of green fluff on my black trousers which was a bit annoying so make sure not to wear anything black if planning to use their blanket they seems to be very punctual in their timings seating was fine food is good but inflight entertainment system is not very impressive and the staff is below average in their interaction and approach But food quality was not so much good Breakfast was not very tasty But had not a good attitude from airline crew means could have been good asked for a specific beer they were serving and just blindly given one which she got in her hand like that if you want you drink However if offered don t EVER select the breakfast pancake Again there was no choice because they had run out of everything else again my breakfast was the best I d had Breakfast was slop didn t taste or look anything like scrambled eggs Far to cold in the cabin not a very good service and food was average at best On top of that for most of hhe trip there were 2 kids screaming all through the the day night no one could sleep through that the food was it good at all would not recommend this airway for any long trips overcrowded and frustrating All in all we were all very disappointed with Etihad would not use them again unless it was purely down to cost if this was the case we would take our own food enjoy a couple of glasses of complimentary wine Food nowhere near as good as it used to be not a lot of room aircraft very full Drinks all the way nice meals the only thing I never understand is I forgot my Burberry cashmere scarf on my seatAsked for a second wine with dinner still waiting Only drawback is the wine serving in Economy class No coffee or tea for breakfast Service spotty service one dlight attendant was quite cold and impersonal bordering on rudeness It is no more a good BREAKFAST like beforeFinally the food was really not good at all salad n sweet 4 hours later 2 small rolls with minimal filling and cuppa dry hard and not satisfying could only pick st them and some 4 hours a custard danish thing that I could not eat nor my husband The food surely on a long haul flight totalling 20 hours there are more options than chicken fake mash potato veges The one board bar service was none existent having to buzz the cabin crew every time you wanted a drink the food or should I say lack of it wasnâ t good my seat couldnt be moved at all the food is Seating was uncomfortable air system was not working really well and the food for the kind of reviews people gave this airlineNo more chauffeur drive staff not as attentive wine selection not great and although the stand alone bed in first is long and wide enough you cant control it as it is a slide out bench so only config is totally flat It seems that those who fly business class or first class have had positive experiences with Etihad but not so much so in Economy re staff attitudes towards passengers rudeness uncomfortable seats food water them down is the food bloody awful Food is notThe snack in the morning was worst a ice cold hard cheese roll with a cold drink no hot drink If Indigo pays due attention to this strategic issue i e become more professional by serving free snacks coffee tea to its passengers without any extra charge their business would definitely boom Delays broken chairs bad service terrible food there are too many precedences a refund which we have to apply to Expedia for as India would not take responsibility we had to pay Â 3000 to get a flight back no apology or sympathy given or any guidance I truly disgusted and airline going out the service was poor food was disgusting and the staff rude and totally disinterested in the passagesDessert was nasty The snack from Imphal to the midway stop in Guwahati is a sugary fruit drink and a cookie watch out diabetics The food was really pathetic and tasteless But the food was terrible Couldnâ t eat them While flying back the food was terrible They let down us again with horrible food no seasoning and bland Then bad food bad leg room delayed flight 45 minutes to get the luggage it was horrible The food is bad and the service is even worse Awful food not enough we were starving the whole time The food was pretty terrible but the flights were all under 4 hours so just the fact that we got something on the plane was already great Not great overall food and beverage service pretty terrible food was like why bother it was that bad Overall bad service bad experience and will definitely NEVER use again The breakfast was terrible Although the aircraft Dreamliner was wonderful and specious even in Economy class the service food were rubbish the crew members were rude arrogant unfriendly and unprofessional 6 the most disgusting food ever The food was awful bland and just no good Poor food in Business ClassBut they should give some better food options as the sandwich was pathetic Catering quality truly awful food and choices 3 cleanliness of seats 4 worst food ever very bad never travelled in air indiaHere they had peanuts and a cold sandwich which tasted horrible Food was awful and the inflight entertainment not much better Their style of asking for food choice was so rude that I wondered if anyone had ever trained them food looked awful and tasted very mediocre some flight attendants looked disgruntled and looked like they didn t get the memo on customer serviceFood is unexceptional and can actually be avoided Air India offered me a hotel room in centaur hotel for a night till tomorrow the hotel is the worst hotel ever not even a star not even a hotel the room smells bed smells bathroom smells the food is disgusting many cockroaches From delayed flights to ill kept planes to bad food to condescending and surly air crew Food on both legs were awful food served was horrible Horrible food broken entertainment systems filthy supplies The flight is so space cramped with pathetic food very old boring aircraft with no amenities like music no display panel Finally we took off only being treated to poor in flight service very bad food poor in flight entertainment not so clean aircraft Food was awful really some of the worst airline food I ve had in years Tomato in the salad was smelling bad Everything else right from the plane to seats to entertainment system to food to service falls short of pathetic Food is bad though specially after removing non veg options from domestic flights the interior is filthy and the seats are broken in some way or other the food looks and tastes like recycled garbage no in flight entertainment other than some old magazines and news papers the staff areâ Food and drink served were horrible as well Always late slow boarding Food they just throw towards you like giving to beggars In flight experience was average the food was the worst Iâ d rather eat something at the airport and board The flight was smooth but the food really was bad especially for an International Airline that is the country s national carrier The meal service was worse then a meal you would get in economy on KLM or Air France Add to it terrible breakfastThe staff insists on waking you up for meal service which is inedible This has to be one of the worst national carriers I have been on Bad food bad in air entertainment not very helpful staff and if your flying to Delhi and have a connecting flight and not much time take careUnfortunately the food is very bad on Air India I basically told her that I would keep bugging her for more drinks if she didn t just give me what I wanted the first time Like any other state run Airline poor service poor food poor management at Vienna Airport The sandwich offered is cold and bad in taste Thus my and my friends bent to look for it and found remaining of food on the floor and did not find what I dropped The food was disgusting Lack of info on delays poor food interior of aircraftWe came back business class which was terrible bad food surly flight attendantsBad quality food at Lounge and Air Line We were left alone so other than just one very poor meal we did receive any further offers for drinks hot or cold The food was just drenched in oil and horrible tasting as well Food is really bad the cutilary usedDirty cabins entertainment system not working on three seats in a row plus no pillows on the international flight to New Delhi and awful food choices on both international flight and domestic connection New Delhi to Bangalore Compared to other airlines in biz class the food is quite bad We all should feel pride in flying with Air India but disappointed with food served The veg meal food served was bad The food service and garbage clearance was done quickly and matter of factly meals were bad and didn t know what we eat until open the pack Flightâ s screens were not working and food was very bad such a terrible taste The food was bad and all electrical systems were out on an 18 hour flightand there was no appetizers except for a small bag of nuts which tasted odd and not fresh like they where 2nds from the manufacturer The staff forgot that it was because of us that they earned their bread Not put in my frequent flyer number in despite several reminders terrible web site that crashes awful foodWorst food supplied in the flight with poor drinks very disappointed with the food Food was of very poor quality Poor cleanliness and food were bad The food is really really bad Food and Drinks are of poor quality Let alone to mention that they offered a hot meal even in their domestic flights about 1 5 hours My table to put my food on got stuck and would not come out so I had to eat from a tray on my lap Coming back my seat would not recline into a bedFood selection mediocre and quality poor Worst food taste despite of indian airline Unfortunately the food they served in the flight was stale and I had stomach problems Despite being in the Red for many years they have not cut corners on service and food to save money Dreadful food both the ways Cabin service was a typical example of government employees dedication cold food which they themselves would not care to eat very poor response to passengers genuine requests etc Horrible snack noâ This time the meal served was pathetic plus of a very small quantity The air hostesses were exactly the same as going out and the food was disgusting The food will be poor Unfortunately the lounge in Cochin airport was without wifi and with a poor food and beverage service The worst was the morning refreshment box like given away to children on a school excursion We took snacks hearing their food was bad but only ate their food there was heaps Sitting was narrow and the foods arent up to mark fly was decent Found drink and meal service abysmally poor The food quality was poor and evenâ One or two which was opens were giving simple sandwich too expensive you can take this food on the half rate right here in the day There was a cockroach in my meal it was absolutely disgusting For some reason they offered supper about 4 hours out of Sydney which seemed to me when most people would have been wanting to sleep I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane I was a bit disappointed with the food They had the best times for departure and arrival however the food on board was not good and the service was poor films were ok and seats were okpoor food and beverage service arrogant behavour of the unkempt crew very basic inflight entertainment international better facilities but atrocious food COLD sliced potatoes and omelette brought in a dominos pizza in and was asked why I swear this portion cannot even be considered as a snack for a 5 year old kid It was delayed and the snacks offered in flight was worse than any train s refreshments if you don t like Indian food then it can be problemThey left us without food and drink for almost 12 hours with nothing provided on the flights Upon complaining to the flight attendants we were said that post food services it would be rebooted and the in flight systems would work Flight leaves at 11 pm a and not take the in flight meal and one would expect at least a decent dinner my daughter got sick since seems they carry food from delhi for the return flight as well Could not comment on the food as I was not brave enough to try it They were rude totally bad looking panting while towing the food trolleys Flight was delayed to take off and Food quality was also ok Meal was dreadful Problem with my second flight food was that Lunch items were more spicy and the snacks that they gave at the end was less and seems low budget It was hard to gulp down the food The sandwich had a cucumber slice which gave a raw taste It was a little difficult to sleep since the staff was serving food or drink and you canâ t keep your chair on an incline because it disrupts the food tray Food was just nice nothing fancy Although a short flight we still got a sandwich and fruit juice First the check in systems failed for two hours we were stranded in long queues without any water or food Not to my surprise post food services the lights were simply dimmed and everyone went to rest But the choice of food was disappointing I would probably give the same opinion like the rest crew is reluctant food is average to low seatWhere as Indigo spicejet charges for food and leg room space is very less so that they can accommodate more passengers and also there were smells in the bathroom and also the food was not quite good andagain 2 hours late in departure and food quality was poor Food and Bar service is again not flawlessFood was appalling and a far lower quality than the food supplied when flying in the opposite direction The food was impossible to eat Though the staff and the crew were very cordial and humble and pilot was highly skilled as the flight was very comfortable smooth without any turbulence but however there were very poor options for food and beverages very poor quality starters and snacks they had no stock of mineral water and they were refilling used plastic bottles no good choice for wines whiskey etc very disappointing and poor quality audio visuals and selection of movies poor quality toilet kits no good reading material except some Indian magazines No seat allocation no soft drinks or even water The flight is delayed minimum 2 hours and food is only vegetarian and no choice Very poorly maintained food looks stale and Cabin crew is as worst the flight itself isAdditionally Indian Air food is usually only a vegetarian menu and is poorly prepared The food was also not good My only complaint relates to the timing of the second meal service about 4 5 hours after breakfast with at least another 6 hours of flight time remaining seemed a little odd I dont eat airlines foodThey could have had food alter atives for people who were not Indian IFE didn t work food was inedible seat broken they got me to Delhi in one pieceFood served was below par and must be addressed as it discomforts passengers on non stop long flights of 16 hours They still provide food on the economy class even for one hour flight is not at all required Hot meal provided about an hour after take off main dish hot but tasteless frozen salad and 2 little hard as rock balls as a desert During this entire fiasco the Air India staff only provided us with a biscuit packet with 2 biscuits and a lunch voucher that only worked during a horrible time You even get a little snack box on this fifty minute flight andEverything was okay except the food After a massive argument involving the check in supervisors we were given two seats together next to the emergency exit and the usual seating supplement was waived 4 Add a positive attitude to flight service the crew ignored calls for service between meals and seemed not to enjoy serving people The rest of the flight was uneventful food is not great some staff appear to have some attitude that they are better than some of people on flight Air India is the shortest flight from Israel to India but the food is not good what time flight will take off and they send us in hotel very far from airport hotel and food is not good as well Aircraft an A320neo seats are horrible can compete with indigo no pillow blankets no IFE stale food and overall feel like travelling a third rate low cost carrier Their entertainment was not very good and the food was OK and the service was almost non existent between meals The meal on the flight was dreadful a cabbage and mayo sandwich The food on all the flights was not too bad either Perhaps the only airline left which offers complementary food in economy class One cant expect this type of food from Airindia Good food but only one meal service on a 5 5 hour flight They hardly serve any food on the flight However the food is not that great Airline food is tolerable in most airlines anyway except maybe Emirates During the entire flight they didn t bring any water beverages etc The second point that I noticed was when food was served there was a shortage of food on the flight which resulted in some who do not like vegetarian food having to opt out either to eat or stay in hunger Third point is you will get some snacks for free not like indigo where u will find air hostess selling chips for 100 rs The food was amazing for the first time but the second time the snacks was too bad and cold croissants This flight arrived before time pilots were chatty staff was cooperative but again the problem was the in flight meal Food was not so good not so bad Night flight so don t expect much food And the food was not nice too Staff was extremely friendly and attentive I thought the food was okay better than coach food but not as good as other business class food I have had The food was not fully cookedold plane the bathroom had no running water the food in business class was unacceptable andgiven no vouchers for a meal or beverage for this supposed operational reason for cancellation then waited extra hour late flight Would not recommend horrible service food tastes not good at all Food is not that good Why do you even give that miniscule amount of food Business class barely seperate from economy and the meal was truly almost inedible The food was not great but not terrible Ummm my only problem was the chilly food Indian Spices on board the airlineBusiness Lounge in Delhi provides poor food drink and service as well Food was delayed due to halt in Sharjah But this time I am little disappointed to know that they are not providing Hindu non vegetarian food in domestic flights Food wasn t that good but it came without any extra cost first ever domestic flight in India easy check in helpful staff always very courteous to my needs Food on board was disappointing only a veg option but overall I d repeat when required Food was okay not amazing indian food Food is not good at all No childrens meals on oubound flight despite ordered 6 out of 6 entertainerne systems did not work Though the food was not enough but because it was the lunch timeI travelled first class on the return journey from Goa to Mumbai and the food was no better Soggy bread rolls and dried out pasta or fries But i requested on line to diabetic food which was not delivered they said they have only choice on non veg or veg food in this flight when i was getting down i saw debries of eaten food bags covers linen scattered all around by passengers I travel air India after 9 years that time my experience was not good food also was spoiled Food tray table is bent and I had to literally hold the tray to keep the food in place The flight was smooth and we were given a meal and water on board without charge even for a relatively short flight May 19 Had been to their Jodhpur AI office to request for a bland meal due to damaged Salivary glands A I The breakfast was so much that we could not eat it all However I didn t expect them to serve hard overheated kathi rolls for dinner on a 11pm flight On the return journey I must say that the flight was a lot better with much better service but the food was still mediocre and and the inflight entertainment was the same poor at best Flew business class from bom to bkk seats were very comfy but the service was very ordinary food was pathethic no tea coffee serviceWhen we arrived to check in for outbound flight they didn t want to check us in just told us that our flight that was leaving 8pm was postponed to 4 40am without any information more in terminal 3 where there are not many restaurants or chairs to wait for more than 8hrs and with young kids Only main issue was with the food but they refuse seats size and space was bigger then jet flight because it s 777 boing aircraft and old one with different type of seats food wasThis meant the dining table and tv did not work Food even in business was mediocre On my flight back home Delhi Vienna we have got 6hours delay and Air India offered us meal in one restaurant The cheap snack before landing from LHR to Del is poor quality and also on domestic route sandwiches and a 50cl bottle of water does not cut the mustard If the food was this substandard in business I wonder what they tossed out as food for the masses in coach Flight reached on time and the meal served in the plane was enough to fill up the tummy but hardly any flight give complimentary food One small thing only I expected to be served some food and drinks free of charge maybe my mistake but we were served only water Children Meal Worst She even ate her meal on top of the bag and the crew said nothing food is ok only problem is entertainment channels did not worked Even for airline food this was bad Appalling food and very limited attention from the cabin crew Food is ok not outstanding but eatable Children s meals best avoided Regrettably nothing was served not even coffee and till the time we reach Chandigarh airport and then to Chandigarh railway station at 11 30 a m The people i e the stewards were so indifferent to the point of being RUDE the food was stale and cold mind you no options The food was exceptsble nothing to write home about Meals light snacks on domestic sector is almost let down rather none u eat what they give and drinks not much on this sector although an international flight with zero inflight entertainmemnt anFood was appalling at one stage our party and another conducted a postmortem as to what the dish actually was Food was the only disappointment Appears that food standard in Air India flight towards south India is definitely of not as good as in other sectors Standard food no TV screens so no in flight entertainment The meal provided by the airlines was very low quality and quantity was not enough for one person Cold food was served which wasnâ t tasty either Got food poisoning on the way home Food certainly not business class standards cabin crew busy with everything else but serving the travelers so they would have no work to do once the food had been handed out I will not say served and garbage collected Staff was nice and however combination of vegetarian food food was odd they have served lady finger vegetables with rice I had never liked the food served in the Aircrafts but the food in Air India was very good and probably for the first time I enjoyed eating the food inside The flight is also not proper food was not great and overall just don t take this flight The food was bad the cleanliness none toilets good only for half of the trip odor horrible service only while takeoff food service and landing and the passengers most ofâ However the aircraft seemed to be ancient and the food served was not up to the mark Its a long flight and overall its a good experience although the food which is serve i didn t like itNo kid meal even after registering for the same Food was wraps and tasteless Our televisions all worked on the return but again the food was bland Food served was not Business Class food Prices are same as other airlines offering budget traveling without meals I was not sure about the services and other facilities such as food I think expecting hot snacks tea coffee isn t too much for a full service airline charging 8000 per head for the 45min trip My son is allergic to peanuts and they had no other snacks for him when asked We swallowed that one paid double and figured we would at least have a â freeâ cocktail in the lounge only to get to the lounge bar and learn there are no complimentary cocktails in domestic zero When asked for a second drink they so rudely rebuffed that I felt I committed a crime I did have to ask for a food drink voucher this was not offered amount of Â 7 50 as a gesture You are trapped for the next 15 hours with not entertainment no drinks very unapologetic crew they wouldn t even come to ask if you wanted any drinks or spirits My flights from Birmingham and Frankfurt left in the evening and I got a little snack some peanuts Our return saw a lot less on the entertainment selection for Westerner tastes had NO Westerner music and the in flight food was this time iridescently average The cabin staff seemed not to care about what people brought onboard Passengers given airline food on a regular basis and plentiful The flight attendants only came around to pass food never responded to request about lighting or TV screen This one is easy to fix and should have little more options for passengers who may not like Indian food A few hours later I started to feel unwell and then soon developed food poisoning that took me several days to fully recover from Of the four flights despite clearly ordering a Vegan meal option for them all I got a standard vegetarian on one on another it was allocated to a person who was not vegan and they had to search to find it and on two I was given Jain vegan which seemed to include a butter croissant and butter to spread on the rolls The interiors of their most common A320s food and everything else is usual or normal Only Veg food was served and as a rule only Veg food will be served it seems Did not serve Kiddies meal Air hostess are not liberal n servicing the drinks and food served has more bread and bread products and less of fresh fruit and salads instead The problem I had was not serving meals which I ordered desperately from the airline The crew amenities space food etc are brilliant nothing comes even close to this airline when it comes to service class We were travelling as a family from Mumbai to Delhi and had booked an air India flight expecting it to deliver a normal veg meal and a boring travel The food was average neither better nor worse than the competition and the gin and tonicâ But food served was not much better The cheapness was apparent from the food containers which were strong enough to be squished by babies and covered with layers and layers of transparent plastic sheets apparently packaged by hastily showing that plastic over a candle Post disembarkation from the aircraft we were shifted to new aircraft however in the whole process air india didn t even offered any compensation food vouchers to the pax The food was mediocre and tasteless Dirty bathrooms horrible entertainment systems and below average food Food served was only veg not happy with that as I am a non veg eater If want a drink have to go and find one as very limited service to seated passengers Besides two meals you won t be asked for anything Coffee or water I hope the gate agent who made my mom throw away the food that was packed for my dad who is a stage 4 cancer patient and has very specific food restrictions also is blessed with cancer so he will one the day remember how ruthless his actions were The crew may not be young like other airlines but they are courteous and the food in recent times has improved considerably In the past two years I have not experienced even a single flightâ We sent one meal back as cold and tasteless They were impatient with passengers and after a cursory meal service we didn t see them again for about 7 hours Food as always was bland but that is relatively typical for any flight The only time we saw the crew apart from embarkation and disembarkation was when they swiftly frisbee d our meals out to us First and foremost the eating tray was unclean with stains so did one of the seats Actually it was a mayonnaise sandwich with a little slaw on a soft roll that would make a Burger King bun seem like the best French Bread Food served is not good better they give water and juices Overall experience is not good I think in short trips why AI serves food not necessary at all may be that s one of the reason for AI loss â overall good flightThey have to take care of food sometimes food quality is not enough good It is our national carrier and would love to encourage but it has most uncomfortable seats average food TV is very far In fact I had no shortage of liquid dinner with not one but two glasses of quality straight whiskey that lasted a very long time The food was quite spicy as sadly expected but otherwise edible every thing was good but while returning from Madrid to New Delhi I found some difference in the food they served which is not as expected and also the air hostesses were a bit negligent Food quality has gone down inflight entertainment systems do not work efficiently The children had no optional menu and drinks were restricted to cola Next on a 15 hour flight the crew never offered Coffee Tea except the occasions of lunch dinner Wish they would improve on the food Needless to say I did not had meals on board the food was not of a good standard and very ordinary so i do suspect it was Economy class food Not impressed with the quality of the food either Meals also they did not give to my kids Guwahati to Delhi was a meal that was not too bad better than Jet Air The baggage allowance is much higher the food is decent not great though and the leg room in Y class is much more than theâ Was offered hot snacks where were not great but palatable Food aesthetics was not on Air India s list it looked as bland as the taste Why not improve the quality of the food cleanliness 90 of the TVs doesnt work overall it was my first flight with Air India and really appreciate the maintenance of craft its facilities and schedule but not the attitude of staff quality of food and its standard Would rate the whole experience 3 10 due to delays quality of food customer service and amenities offered Your complimentary burgers will not supportedâ Meals are full of carbohydrates too salty and spicy not tasty rather unhealthy for such a long flight But by the time we finished our food the turbulence started and it continued till the time of landing at Indore Airport It serves some gourmet meal snack during the flight is something that other airlines discontinues and some do not do at all Food served was average Business class seats is a flat bedThe food itself could have been nicer and there were no working headphones it seemedThe seats were spacious flat bed the hostesses were friendly and the service was good although i dint like the food very muchâ But airline folks didn t budge and no food no accommodationNo food or drinks or alternatives neither information As the journey time was short cold drinks and peanuts were given The inflight entertainment is a bit antiquated quality of the inflight magazine is about average Meal choices are essentially vegetarian or non vegetarianâ The dinner was a mediocre curry with a yogurt in a container like you buy in the supermarket in the States On our return flight the AI 282 on 30 Dec from Colombo to Delhi had meal choice not available despite the flight being only 70 full and the inflight crew did not have the decent courtesy to offer apologies for the same reflecting a complete disregard to customer service The air hostess started serving food and when she came to my seat told me Non veg is over now you will get only veg What a way to put it across No food quantity guess how it feels easting plain rice with dry paneer sabji Later I had mentioned to Flight Attendants not to wake me for meals but only for tea or coffee and they did exactly that Now to the bad points Inflight meals Economy is horrible Cleanliness 4 Lounge 3 food in lounge was a let down this was perhaps the Delhi airport small things like give the wifi password when the guest comes to the lounge would reduce the guest effort to go to counter again Air India flight have Large leg space free meal world class service upto 25 kg of luggages in domestic flight more than others airline Only vegetarian food available that too very spicy You get much better food in economy class in Qatar airways or even Lufthansa Then was not made aware the soft drinks were inâ Outbound they wouldn t accept our Air Canada boarding passes and we we made to wait 1 hour for someone to come back from lunch No dinner served on a dinner flightAnd obviously no appetizer They are not willing to transfer to other airlines not willing to provide food or hotel stay voucher No food quality they could not serve roti even inspite of an Indian airline In a flight bangkok to rome the first flight bkk to delhi was a truly nightmare old airplane very dirty with no food or entertainment One wonders why they cant think of small issues like the quality of food being provided They declared that they had no snacks to offer with drinks No non vegetarian food served on board no meal options no booking managementAir India now serves only vegetarian snacks to its customers Child meal was super spicy so not kid friendly at all Food better than others as others do not give anything except water A rather poor looking sandwich made with European style sliced bread and aâ Finally it was a dinner flight and perhaps I was more exhausted and sleepy than hungry and hence did not find the rice with paneer in it and dal meal though servedmy dinner was very lateAlso they have only juices and nothing for those who do not want to have these sugary syrups like diet coke or diet Pepsi the bun was stale like a rock the dessert was stale too I spent about 20 minutes in the lounge and could not find something worthwhile eating as I hadâ regards the food serves in airline it also was not up to the mark and was against of the taste Breakfast was kind of a weird mashed potato affair with raisins and caraway seeds and a cream cheese croissant Our ticket was labelled Discount Business and I certainly noticed that it was a notch down from usual Business Class eg limited drinks offering when boarding the plane Solution take another seat between other passengers for meals which were terrible I am not talkin about one pizza Day time flight but in between meals no service at all The choice of food was not good only friedâ Earlier we had travelled on Qatar the hostess came looking for us said you have requested for a bland meal Turned out to be aâ formâ of pizza which was quite unrecognizable they didnt serve pre booked meals when i inquired they informed that they didnt get any information from ground staff in flight have not good meal This is not enough food for a ten hour long flight Evidence of cost cutting everywhere fewer choices on the menu smaller portions and the breakfast box was atrocious The flight crew are all smiles when you board but aside from the obligatory safety announcement and when serving meals they are not visible at all they disappear behind a curtain and are not to be seen Food not so great but it s very rare for airline food to be anything other than barley edible The food has no choice and only veg and quality was also not very good The staff were overwhelmed they did not have a basic selection of soft drinks the cutlery plastic was missing from my sonâ s meal and by the time we got the attention of the staff his meal was cold The eats do not function well Did not have dinner No menu food was awful and very spicy The service was pleasant and quick and food was OK not brilliant so no complaints No inflight entertainment skipped the unappealing meal I had chosen this unclean untimely airline which serves stale food only to use the transit time to meet my friends at Delhi which did not happen due to them Air India s flight was considerably cheaper when compared to others that too the only one to offer snacks alongwith Also they did not create paperwork hassles unlike Jet Airways wrt my mother s ticket who was discharged after hospitalisation and especiallyâ Drinks were offered hours into flight and when any assistance was needed it was not given We were served peanuts and a glass of coke as appetiser non smiling faces n rude and inefficient they managed to miss serving food to some passengers i was one of those and they actually never noticed it until i told them so service was very shoddy at best Food quality is also not good Why does Air India ask for meal preferences in the ticket when they were not interested in giving those meal options â great meals onboard even in economy class The Business class lounge at Heathrow supplied ample food choices before boarding though with a meal booked it wasn t necessary the quality of service is nowhere close to other business class on the return journey I asked for the food menu and after 2 mins I received a photostat black and white print though it has improvedThey only served peanuts as snack They took no responsibility for the missed flight and provided no compensation for the loss of our hotel room in Bodhgaya the extra hotel night in Delhi or meals Food was a lot better too Iâ d have to say Only request is to add option of non veg food as well as I am a non vegetarian and would hv liked to enjoy non veg food Only part that could have been better was the inflight entertainment menu Not enough meals ordered so only veg option available The cabin crue where not willing to provide people with tea or coffee throughout the flight and when my entertainment system didnâ t workThough the snack served was not good with all the famed derision of airline food nothing more should be expected i thought taking Airindia ill fly with Comfortable but its worst experience my fight was 23 00 from Delhi on 17 April 18 and after take off normally food Drinks come but it will come after 2 hr when we almost sleep I had my doubts and air India confirmed those doubts the food was appalling including business class journey for my other itenaery They could not serve the food to all of the passengers as food of choice was finished Flight was at 7 00 am one would expect tea coffee to be served at this time Cons Quality of headset pathetic have to change 3 times Big scope of improvement on food options and quality along with inflight hosts The quality of Peanuts served along with drinks was highly substandard besides contaminated with Aflatoxin a potential carcinogen Economy food is not something you look forward toUnappetising food with no choice in the business lounges Food was served in haste and there was no gap in between the welcome drink and the food served The dessert don t know what it is called was ugh Onboard food provided by this particular flight is awesome for this below 2hours flight terrible felt like in local train special meal ordered not offered During all day we were with no food and no water A much welcome change from all other airlines which do not serve or serve some insipid eats Then they turn on full lights still not lightening the windows as if they are waking us up when it is time for breakfast at 5pm Paris time before arrival The flight staff were amazing nothing was too much trouble and the food was lovely not good taste crew membes have not good service in flight some we requier water tea coffeeThey could have atleast provided coffee tea and biscuits if not breakfast Unfortunately we got two cups of tea and one cup of coffee There was no issue with check in and boarding the staff behaved well and there was a serving of tea coffee with cakes biscuits and sweets all at free of cost which we missed badly during our return flight by Indigo Airlines Air India has great food the same identical uncomfortable seats and leg space as all other European or American Carriers but lower prices Their breakfast quantity is not sufficient The breakfast included wada sambhar which resulted in food poisoning to me and my friend I do not know how Air India has found a new love in the form of cold sandwichFlight was in time breakfast provided in flight was good except that they don t provide non veg We didnt open the breakfastOn the flight the food was nice the flight wasn t late but the service by the cabin crew is far from ok at that time food was the only positive thing travelling in Air India now it is bad Food also good but a lack of menu a little strange and wine just red or white Food certainly not good served quickly on plastic trays Interior in poor and dirty condition Bad infotainment system small selection of movies only Hindi music food was okayThe hostess on this flight was very rude 3rd Nov return flight same food but this time the gentleman serving us was polite and concerned that I didn t eat Food Mediocre Food service ambience is lowest in the class Food horror Air India was pretty average in terms of everything food seats check in As ever the most annoying part of travel in SpiceJet cropped up during webcheckin I had to pay for webcheckin since the airline forces you to pay for choosing a seat No accountability no proper answer from statue like staff kept on receiving a message telling that flight got delayed due to operational reasons Finally irate passengers started flocking the gate staff and there was a big commotion While I am aghast at this experience and utter disregard to a genuine grievance I hope the idiots at SpiceJet customer relations and the airhostess enjoy a satisfactory meal at my moneys expense while I now head out to buy my child a toy bag which she missed because I was refused a service which I had paid for Low cost does not necessarily mean bad or not so good service We had few extra luggage because of international flight and they did not allow us 1 kg extra per person other airlines allows 1 2 kg extra and asked to pay 400 Rs per kg whereas I checked online for excess baggage which was only 150 Rs per kg for international travellers Worst and disgusting service will never fly spice jet ever they told me to wait for 6 hours or go to home and come any other day with a new ticket Be careful prior to purchase ticket at the end of the day you will pay the more amount with less service compare to full fare flight airline do not get trapped in fare difference of INR 1000 or near by compare to full fare airline they will say low cost airline and selling cheap fare at the end may not work for you Delays happen economical airlines do give less options I can manage with all that but not with insensitive and poor customer service Worst class of service Also the ground staff are not geared up to handle such situations leaving a bad experience to the passenger Even the air hostess was very rude when we tried to ascertain the things and told her what the sales staff told us during the upgradation THIS IS AN ACT OF DEFICIENCY IN SERVICE and UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICE as per sections 2g 2r of Consumer protection act 1986 3 Even after reaching the gate no 5 after security check we were called and harassed to return to the boarding pass counter without any reason IEven the airline staff at gate had no clue when the flight will leave We decided to fly Hyderabad Vizag 60min flying time due to old people back pain issues and ticketing staff do not care Please see that the staff is well trained paid knows how to deal with such situations The air hostess passes with a tray full of water glasses and she blindly passes us without even serving water While returning back from Bangkok to Kolkata in September 2016 we opted for Spicejet as it was the cheapest and the journey started well with a very smooth check in but after the security check the flight started getting delayed and our wait became longer and asThe staff at check in gate was efficient courteous however the experience was ruined by ignorant and rude staff at Boarding gate who insisted for disallowing overnight bag with 4 kg as accompanied luggage on the fight was full A few of us were feeling unwell but the staff flatly refused Airline staff is rude and disrespectful After boarding the aircraft pilot announces change in a tyre and therefore 40mins delay Inspite of all this the rude behaviour of staffs like Sangeeth can impair the image of the flight Also the staff did not organize the entry in to the flight well as all the people waiting were allowed boarding at once We sat on the seat allocated and was looking for flight entertainment there was non extra legroom Strangely even the CISF jawans bless them admonished the airline staff for causing us to miss our flight and told them that it was just not right Staff behaviour was so rude and not at all supportive Rude behaviour from air hostess and flight stewards I cannot believe it when I come across such illogical pathetic service No support from arrogant staff what pathetic service extreme rude and arrogant staff didn t listen at all not only me1 rude staff Ground staff were very rude and arrogant Ridiculous ground staffs don t have manner how to behave with customer Worst service and horrible staffs u have Another point of shocking service was that we weren t offered a chance to buy a drink from the trolls service Such a pathetic serviceThe staff refused to allow waiting passengers to even go to a nearby hotel at our own expenses Very bad services 60 passengers baggages got after 3days Dirty planes bad service and delays were very annoyingBad attitude of crew members very rude not at all cooperative Worst Service Staff was very rude Staff were rude and laughing at us and the attitude of air hostess was pathetic Bad customer service Staff was rude Staff is extremely unprofessional and always frustrated Airline staff was arrogant and totally non co operative Pathetic service pathetic experience with spicejet because of rude crew members hoping to improve your performance on board One air hostess coming off the airplane with her bag was arrogant and rudeboth delay airports t1 and t2 encountered rude and inefficient staff Legroom is terrible so congested airline customer service is also awfulService is with a stiff upper lip and at times tilting to the rude side The customer care executives are incredibly rude This is pathetic airline in customer service The Delhi airport staff had a horrible attitude and the toilets were disgusting but the airline staff refused to accommodate it as hand baggage charged an amount of Rs 400 as penalty though she could have easily managed it Means are they trying to be smart or they don t even know the basics of their services The flight attendant was the most rude lady we had ever seen Spicejet needs to improve its servicesWhile landing at Chandigarh twice the pilots aborted the landing in spite of being close to runway which was scary Am extremely disappointed and annoyed with their services pls do not travel via spicejet ever worst customer service The staff was rude and refused to even speak to us or answer our questions DGCA is not ready to take any conginance of the same as they are corrupted by the management Really bad serviceBy the way I did complaint on Customer serviceOne can understand the weight limitations for check in and hand luggage but rude behaviour is certainly not acceptable in any service industry The counter staff was very rude in her behaviout Boycott Spicejet for the low rate of customer service and arrogant attitude the ground staffs behaviour is really ruthless Worst customer service never got to fly my name was misspell they refuse to let me enter the airport HORRIBLE HORRIBLE staff and airlines pls avoid at any cost them no concept of customer concerns for them Very pathetic customer service by Spicejet The services are frustrating and the food is paid Extremely BAD ATTITUDE BAD SERVICE for SPICE CLUB matters Even the ground staff was rude Itï ½s one of the worst flight in the world The staff is rude and non cooperative neverrrrr very pathetic service and flight Also they have non Refundable policy rude staff who says it s your fault to check if we have tieups or not A terrible delay of 6 hours only to recive a lame explanation from a Spicejet staff with no apology and states and they gave me THE WORST service ever in any case we were on abu dhabi tour and delayed our return by 1 hour we reached airport at 8pm and checkin was done by 9pm then the horror story revealed in 5 installments they delayed they flight by 16 HOURS never giving any accurate info till the very end useless staff at airport who were hiding behind the airport and emirates staff to shield themselves Such an Pathetic service So far Flight got delayed1 hoursVery bad service and airport staff rude and non cooperative both in Delhi as well as in srinagar Pathetic management Very bad service when we reached on time services were denied to us I have never experienced such bad service or treatment before The pilot s take off and landing was terrible the funniest joke was when in flight announcement they say 5 hour journeyMore room centre seat is empty and super hot food and service Such a pathetic customer experience This is more pathetic as i will have to change airport terminal also and when same was asked ground staff at jammu we were simply told that it will 10min changing through shuttle Spice Jet service was simply awful This was one of the worst flight experiences of my life Passengers cannot shout because now the staff can throw you out on minimal charges worst service worst flight i had ever travelledSpiceJet us probably the worst flight to take to Goa In one word they are trying to make Air Bus a literally State Transport Bus Staff at checkin window were very rude will never book spice jet flight i was surprised to see the wash basin in the wash room was full of dirty water and was blocked by some tissue when i asked the Air Hostessbut their ground staff was awful Poor customer service and the airline overcharges Because here even if the tickets are cheap everything else is paid with terrible service Staff at delhi airport is extremely rude and unprofessional especially when you are arriving but they dont even ring such a shame and poor customer support Arrogant staff Staff on this airline are most unhelpful and rude When asked cabin crew had the audacity to say this was normal in any flight We had a very bad experience to the point where one of the customers slapped a staff at the airport In fact the airport staff was so rude that they took away my US passport and refused to give until I pay the money I ve never heard of such bad customer service before and the staff dealing with this were cold and uncaring Pathetic service it s the most pathetic airline with no respect at all for their customer s valuable time they won t understand that people books the flightHope spicejet takes customer service seriously Very pathetic service ground level staff are really worthless I recommend not to fly through spicejet at any costthey had no clue and told me to call customer care and gave me complaint number and said the complaint was not written Also the cabin staff was behaving childish that I could not explain in words no information was passed still waiting at the airport no SpiceJet Staff hereStaff at airport in dubai was really rude The staff is the most rude staff I ve ever met Really pissed by this particular airline Very very poor service However that doesn t mean that the unpaid services are pathetic Staff are very unprofessional and rude This is a horrible horrible airlines and if this is how airline operations work at SpiceJet I will boycott this airlines for good was on a business trip my crn number XCZRRT very rude behaviour of the senior crew THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE Awful service The counter staff were rude uninterested and unhelpful i really very disappointing for this behaviours of airlines This company Lied about the price of the flight Ignored my emails I sent 5 emails to the customer service people and was ignored in all of them and used extremely intense brainwashing and advertising techniques to try to manipulate people into spending money Poor customer serviceExtremely poor service and very dissatisfied Spicejet Staff of airlines is very rude Ground staff rude I was greatly offended and insulted by a staff member and so called leader of a spice jet team Sangeeta was her name as I was checking in on my flight between Jammu and Srinagar The senior cabin crew shouted at him and falsely accused him of threatening I don t recommend it for anyone poor service won tï ½dreadful food uncomfortable seats poor service late take off on all legs dirty aircraftPathetic service at call centre when requesting a very minor error correction in name They continued until half hour to land where I had to stand up and force the crew to stop them One has to ask what sort of airline guest representative could write in such a vulgar and childish manner Unethical company with poor customer service Horrible basic facilities There staff attitude is very poorSpicejets is a scam never book any additional services of spice they never deliver and the ground staff are rude Never has been such a bad domestic flight experience in India for me The Bagdogra airport is a mess the security staff is ill trained the airline staff over busy and there are very few food options The checkin staff were intractable as to the overweight abount and insisted that we pay excess baggage of 3 000 rupees AND a handling charge of another 2 000 rupees Even Mr GK Singh threatened that lady to throw out of the airport with the help of security personnels The staff here are very rude and inhumane My wife along with one year old infant we re travellingThe plane was stinking with urine smell and the staff faced the other way when we complained To this question of my the crew showed extreme disappoint said that she will get it in a very rude tone but food is much gutter pathetic even Air Histress agreed I would like to report an extremely rude customer representative Deepika Chudasama at Ahmedabad airport Ground staff sucks inflight staff sucks Had horrible landing experience The overall experience once you are inside the flight is good but ground staff is horrible Poor ground service Flight was ok but we had some terrible experience due to bad scheduling Extremely poor food and service for extra money paid Pathetic service Had to pay for food very expensive Spicejet has no customer service I ended up driving to Bangalore instead to catch a later flight home and spent more money that I should have international crew lack Indian sensibilities so that was a big setback for a 737 there was good leg room available being a low cost anything else is chargeableThe air hostesses were not welcoming at all and I got a pathetic flight experience I was standing in a queue for 10mins and late for reporting time because of that ground staffs refused to give me boarding pass and make endless excuses because of that i missed flight time and money whatNo one wants to waste time with their arguments and try to leave which these staff are using for their rudeness Also their customer centre was very annoying in calling up multiple times to sign you up for the SpiceMax service WORST AIRLINE TO TRAVEL WHENIN INDIA First of all they will put buffet of services and will torture you by multiple calls messages and mails Staff had zero empathy and was getting offensive when questioned why was wheel chair passenger not boarded first I was told by their crew donï ½t teach us how to do the boarding Ground staff are very arrogant and less responsible After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2 000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused My complain is not against the airline or the service At almost same cost better facilities in Thai Airways Air conditioning not so comfortable They have poor tech and disappointing customer service where they will make you wait on the call for 30 mins and then disconnect the call This was the worse flight agency we had ever encountered with the lowest level of professionalism We passengers are paying their salaries and they must believe in service rather then care a damn about it Until the take off the air hostesses were saying that the plane would leave in 15 min but those 15 min never came for 3 5 hours The flights are surely economic but the design of the plane is horrible they seem to have thrown ergonomics away while making the aircraft Spice jet is a low fare airline but fools customers by charging same fare as full service airline Ruined part of our holiday experience and a waste of time when we got back home trying to sort things outStaff was found doing make up in front washroom while ladies waited to take a leak and the crew were least botheredPoor in air experience Very poor customer handling untrained and unprofessional staffs including manager very poor approach Spicejet has become one of the worst airlines in Indian aviation history ever 5 Their customer care is pathetic Hopeless and Pathetic state of service Please refrain from taking Spice Jet for any occasions as they are the most unreasonable and unscheduled flightHorrible ground staff and air hostesses no punctuality Let me start by saying that service providers must remember that one unprofessional staff can ruin the reputation of the entire brand experience and the company cannot excuse themselves from the bad recruitment I felt cheated as we had paid extra charges for getting special services Irresponsible and not at all supporting airlinesVery worst airlines always this airlines makes delay or early flight these airlines make the passengers to wait for maximum 3 hrs 40 minsCustomer support is even worse The staff at the check in counters were horrible they refused to listen to us while we were checking in Spicejet is the worst flight I hate this company and this was one of the worst travel experiences I have ever had Systems had just restarted after an hour the staff were stressed but still on top of the game our flight was at morning 6 00am indigo was giving check in to passengers having flight at morning 8 00am but this spice jet they came at 4am so lazy staff dont bother about about passengers and after complaining they told us its there policy A poor airline with very badly maintained aircraft where electrical wires were visible and could be a source of electrical shock When you say Sorry we regret the inconvenience caused at least try to make up to the customer rather than making more money out of the customer s inconvenience I have been very disappointed with spicejet s service Took Spicejet from Chennai to Chandigarh had a terrible experience in terms of cleanliness crew friendliness luggage handling etc 1 But truly speaking the sits were dirty and the air hostess were not that beautiful as I imagined and I had been denied my paid service But boarding gate experience was really horrible and humiliating One of my friends boarded the wrong flight because of this simultaneous boarding So far the worst flight i have ever travelled in The hotel staff were equally rude and we were being made to feel as if they were doing a favor on us Poorest most pathetic customer care ever seen in any field in my life Worst airline it may not exist for more than a year But my expectations were shattered when the staff was reluctant to consider any request to adjust the hand baggage allowance with the un utilized check in baggage allowance All along the manner of handling passengers was poor and abrasive One man was fighting with the staff so the flight was further delayed This has over time become the worst airline in India Spice jet is the worst airline Poor people and Poor airlines Bad Customer service and please do not book spicejet at all we felt really cheated by the attitude of the airline as the flight got delayed by close to 7 hours On 22 Dec the departure of sg 249 was scheduled at 2 55 which was late by 3 hours and also the service of the plane was very poor I have been a frequent traveller but never had seen a poor service like we had on this flight The worst airline first delayed for 2 hours then 4 hoursYou will loose lot of money in calling that pathetic customer care Spice Jet has very poorly trained flight attendants Due to storm this delay was informed way later after crowd demanded explanation SMS and customer care call from spice jet came rupess for a check in baggage I paid it via my debit card the airline staff charged me extra which was a mistake made by their side Customer care generation of complaint number is so painful through unprofessional customer care ï ½executivesï ½ This is the worst airline I have ever travelled with This has been the worst domestic flight experience I have ever had in my traveling life SpiceJet offers a very poor service as always Spicejet staff worst in Chennai i have opted wheel chair for my father they didn t provide even after multiple requests It does not pay to be cheap and you will be completely disappointed with the quality of the flight once you board Nearly missed our flight out of Jaisalmer due to incompetent staff Right from the departure arena at Swarnabhumi Airport Bangkok they do not have sufficient counters to manage the public for Luggage Check in and have to stand atleast for 2 hours in queque waiting for a turn as their staff is extremely slow and lethargic as compared to other airlines Please refrain from such scams and look for a different airline Spicejet Ground Manager in Srinagar flatly refused for any help for my missed flight since the connecting flight was with other airlines According to my opinion indigo and goair is worst airlines in Service and comfortability as well After the boarding was over and all the passengers were already on the plane Spicejet crew allowed a group o people standing on the plane stares to literally stop the plane from departing I had a very bad experience flying with spice jet I thought we had some bad airlines in America but SpiceJet is truly awful I did not take the flight back of spice jet because I was so disappointed The flight attendants were least bothered about this Smelly flight the inside of the flight smelled rotten Also the check in staff at Mumbai airport was really rude when confronted with the details of this rule this has single handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company anywhere in the world Air Hostes were ok but pilot drove very badly toowe have wasted our lots of time on Spicejet customer care in Goa and also flight conditions are also bad continuous noise terrible journey Worst Flight The budget flights is fast yet the services are disappointing Pathetic service for web check ins but sometimes there is delay from fixed schedule of flight that is sometimes annoyingIt was really terrible that they were not maintaining needed air pressure inside the flight especially SpiceJet was most worst airline in my experience Calls to the Customer Care were of no use as they said Airport s Flight Staff had the discretion Shame on your SpiceJET WORST AIRLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE and OUR LAST FLIGHT ON SPICEJETI had never seen such poor customer service from spice jet staff and further its for sure that their flights are never on time We all know Spicejet is low budget airline but does it mean exteme low quality and lowest quality of services After an hour on the ground the plane has taken off again and we arrived at Mumbai around midnight instead of 9 pm and the second part of the flight has been very stressful In fact the cabin crew stated we have to pay for our coffee which is an insult to the airlines inability to provide refreshments to passengers of the delayed flight My flight was from Bangkok to Ahmedabad they canceled the flight by lack of passengers and shifted my flight to one day before and again we slept on airport because of flight delay 5 hours please donï ½t choose this worst flight from Ahmedabad to BangkokInitially they provided assistant at Varanasi airport who left us somewhere and left telling someone will come at the time of boarding They made us wait for 12 hours in the airport and there is no available senior airline staff to explain the situation Flight kept getting delayed and no reason was given I am very hurt and disappointed with SpiceJet ground staff for not helping us when we were lost at Kolkata airport and I can tell you spice Jet is the worst airline in the world Thwy want to mint money by screwing their own customers while service is 3rd class When it was my turn to check in I have told my destination and the staff over there told me to go stand in another line Yes ofcourse I agree with readers review as maintained my favourite airline but seems to be very bad customer service along flight delay mean to cancel all connected flights shame to passengers let down during their longer journey without prior notice I feel for the poor flight attendants We had a wonderful time in India on our honeymoon and it took one bad experience with spice Jet which is still continuing to this day to leave on a bad note of our time spent in India Spicejet airline service is worst and staff member are not co operative The air hostesses were very rude and did not even treat the passengers with any respect I always thought that low cost airlines does not mean great customer service and never expected too much but not anymore I would suggest if you are travelling from Hyderabad to take a direct flight to Colombo since the Immigration in Chennai is horrible with long queues and wait time is nearly 60 min wah what an airline no food was sold being a low cost airline at 25 grand return ticket and above aa group of kesari and sf the male passengers were completely drunk casuing a mayhem and danger even to the crew of the airline But on this occasion unfortunately my flight search led me to inadvisedly booking with Spicejet which was a huge mistake We were then told to drive 3 hours to Chennai and book a new flight to Bengalaru and that they would NOT pay for the ride as the bad weather was not caused by the airline It s a budget airline so having no in flight entertainment and little elbow room is expected First hand this is the worst flight you could take anywhere the window and isle seats are paid 200 for each in online check in Worst Flight experience Really the worst airline to travel with The staff allow most passengers to carry huge bags and boxes as carry on baggage probably weighing much more than the limit of 7kg Except for the problem whilst booking the staff said that there would be a refund but none was done But trust me they has the worst staffing and customer serviceit was really bad flight SpiceJet Bombardier Q400 is a small flight with lot of noise Not very pleasent experience food worst flight atmosphere is also k that sound has literally killed me When we went through the checked bag scanner one of the staff grabbed my bag stuck a tag on the lock and then accompanied me to check in and waited This is worst International Airlinesbut this one incident of bad customer service has never been seen or heard of in the service industry service one more while travelling from kochi to raipur the flight was rescheduled but they dont even mail it or any help and taken charges for print out for the same flight worst staff worst in class air india is far better then this airlines Even my daughter s flight left before time and reached before time and baggage was cleared in few minutes worst airline please do not use spice jet airline service they do not provide even water to drink they are not professionsals they do no how to treat a customerThere were only 2 staff at the ticketing counters and the system as well as the staff were extremely slow very poor service never choose this airline After numerous calls from all people the ground staff at hyd was made aware of the delay which was just a 10 15mins delay and they assured they would help us with the situation agreed but exceptionally if a child who is not feeling well and a blanket if at all is needed which was not even used by spice max passengers the crew bluntly denied One of the worst flying experiences in recent times After that horrible experience with spicejet call center and spicejet management Spicejet seems to have the poorest passenger service in recent times Extremely poor and disappointing service by SG on this flight SpiceJET is worst airline I would conclude that service provided to me was pathetic in terms of seating non reclining seat even upon requesting spending my 2 hoursI agree It was my fault and reached customer care to re schedule to morning one Despite explaining to the check in staff that it was a family emergency due to death in the family and being able to clearly see that the flight had been booked just 2 hours prior at a non concessional fare the check in staff denied boarding Overall my feeling is the management has issues Worst airline butEven the boarding staff is not on time I am writing this mail with great grief and disappointment on behaviour of your crew member Vaibhav and Julie Strangely the aircraft personnel who will not even tolerate an ill person to lie back just shrugged it away but i never expect this much worst flight i ever travelled in my life I decided to avoid late night flight from cheapest airlines The flight time is around one and a half hours Check in was too slow because of airport computer system failure very long time in queue Their customer service is so bad and the flight is really difficult Service was a tad slow for my liking Slightly unconventional methods eg skidding on wet taxiway when pilot realised he needed to turn It was a terrible experience flying with spicejet from kolkata to bangkok the attendants were least bothered to cater to needs of passengers the food served was some probably some stale food just warmed up before being served This ordinary airline comes my way every time I travel to Coimbatore for at least to or fro journey with matchless consistency of terrible service from cabin space to cleanliness and zero offering pertaining to food This was the worst air travel I have done in my 20 year flying it wasn t even cheap and still the service was terrible then we asked for their senior staff as they said flight is delayed from 5 30 am to 12 25 pm So one wouldn t expect much from this excuse of an airline This is the morning flight which was delayed by more than 45 minutes Worst flying experience in my last 20 years of travel I ve flown my fair share of airlines over the years and this is the worst the staff asked me to pay 60 Dhs INR 1200 per KG totally 180 Dhs And since they delay the flight and immediately board the flight with next lot of passengers the seats are not cleaned properly and the pockets are left with empty glasses and bottles and leftover food packets of previous passengers Itï ½s the worst Airline service u can opt to travel This used to be my preferred carrier but over the last couple of years their services have taken a hit Entering the aircraft you could smell something weird like a stale smell and the cleaning staff didnt even bother to take out the used tissues out of the pocket right in the front This was a 10 hour journey in a poor quality vehicle with no refreshments provided A typical economy flight you get what you pay for it did depart late hence arrived late but only by a few mins so no real problem But NO SpiceEFFINGjet decided to delay the flight whileThe ground staff allowed multiple lines for the same counter creating lot of confusion and wait for the passengers All they told us was please email the customer care dept and complain they refused to give me a better seat and shifted me to another seat of the same kind no compensation for their terrible service and comfort Very bad airline feels like a bus but when the request turned into complaints the flight attendants opened the doors Nice service on time take off and no issues with the baggage courteous staff will travel again in spice jet The air inside the aircraft smelled like a rotten the whole while it was in flight from Hyderabad to Chennai They give budget service if you don t up grade I had one of the worst flying experience on my flight on 4th Nov 2018 on SG 939 PHF6HR to Delhi If you honestly value customers and customer service I urge you to at least speak to your employee about her behavior all the best to Spiec Jet in their endeavor to work towards becoming t he worst airlines in indian And the customer service is very bad I suspect they even have any customer care centre This is on of the worst flight one can take to travel to Dubai Only problem with my last flight was poor quality of announcement That s the reason why the engines were almost off during the half of the flight even basic cabin safety wasn t carried out and it looked like the crew didn t want to ask people to put away tray tables and recline seats back to the seated position The worst was that the two seats given to us were non reclining seats and the check in staff told me that they are reclining seats The spicejet service at Pakyong airport was not great and was very unpleasant The staff is slow to response to our inquiries Shocking to see the ground staff to display absolute impoliteness I feel I have never been insulted so badly by any aviation personnel previously To add to this trouble was the bullying attitude of the Spicejet staff not taking any measure to ease the 6 hour stay in the crammed waiting area I have never dealt with more difficult and unhelpful staff Flight can get cancelled any time and when you ask staff about reason they have no answer Slice jet improved over time with lost of facilities at low cost Flight is ok but services are getting worst please get yourself clarified Ask for water but air hostess forgot There staff works so slow that it will take u 40 mins to stand in web check in lineMy round trip from Mumbai to Guwahati in the first week of June was one of my worst flying experience till date worst maintenanceSomeone at the airline needs to take notice and do something about it Disconnected staff at airport and in flight Poor security screening The plane levelling during landing approach was horrible and many in our cabin really thought the pilot would crash the plane Limited seating space negligent staff and delayed flights is all You end up with if you opt for SpiceJet Staff seemed surly and uninterested unless passengers wanted to buy food Last travel thru this worst airline whom dosent even know how to talk to their Guests Thankfully they did manage to get us onto a flight the next morning which was again delayed by 2 hours because our pilot was delayed coming into Udaipur The check in in Mumbai is a serious problem and the staff is clueless on how to mange the traffic of checking in pax it was a lease aircraft with russian staff who were unable to understand hindi and were totally non co operative staff airport so reluctant not listening at all My in laws both senior citizens who suffer from walking disabilities and asthma were subjected to some callous and heartless treatment by the SpiceJet staff Typical flight with nothing much to say They re a budget airline and you can tell by the poor service they provide The staff doesn t even have cotton balls to be put in ears for children Staff was trying to cope up with the delayCustomer service centre in New Delhi is the worst to get hold off when calling as an international traveller It looks like the senior cabin crew is using anti terrorism rules to cause terror to the passengers It was left removed during the whole flight and the attendants were busy selling the snacks Staff in aircraft mentioned wrong baggage belt But in Spicejet crews are very rude with passenger and never smile and response properly The counter staff very clodly said you are overweight and this wont be allowed her exact words I mean if I pay excess baggage then suddenly it would be allowed so why do talk about allowing or not allowing If your staff gave me the opportunity on that day to help I am sure I would have been able to resolve this fiasco for free this incident left a bad reminder to staff and passenger and the carrier next door Vistara was quite amused looking at the chaos in hand very cheap the pilot did not drive it properly and the landing was terrible and food was goodour flight was delayed and we were stranded in Hyderabad as our connecting flight took Flight was delayed a bit as the airport is managed by the Air Force In flight staff are also okay and quite moody This is not expected from a staff of SpiceJet it was just 5 mins late to take boarding pass but spice jet staffs didn t help me their behavior was totally rough Crew kept promising that it will be on in few minutes which took almost 2 hours in boiling temperature Arrived at the airport for said flight and was told it had now been cancelled It was the travelers who stood by themselves in a que after a 15 min delay from the scheduled time is when the spicejet associate mentioned about the delay with a reason of flight just being landed and boarding will start in next 5 mins and will try to take off on the scheduled time Inattentiveness or poor training very low standard service after paid cost like full service aircraft are very old and need over haul maintenance of aircraft is very poor only plus point is ontimeThe above statement will always automated generates against your each and every time you will send your issue to to spicejet customer care mailwhich is horrible reply by any service industry staff then staff started misbehaving with me and my elderly parents but I didn t get any SMS regarding this so I ask for refund they ask me to dial customer care and customer caresaid I donï ½t use your airlines but am paying 8500 rs for an hours flight as jet doesnï ½t have an early morning flightWhen I finally reached the check in counter after security clearances and running some 600 meters I told one of the staff that my family was stuck at the second security checkpoint and for him to go and see if they have managed to go through the security so that we do not miss our next flight to Patna Only one difficulty is that the flights of Spice Jet always late Flew this Airline after a long break because of a very disappointing act of the cabin crew about 2 years back There was no announcement or display of airline for checkin even 3 hours before flight time On board crew closed doors removed ladder by leaving one ground staff person in flight only again he is grounded after opening door and re adding ladder Initially the flight scheduled to leave by 1400 hrs was delayed to 1445hrs and thereafter got delayed to 1545 then 1845 and finally at 1900 hrsWorst airline can t web check in waste of money my family tried web checking in from Dubai to Pune even that web check in6 the flight looks like an advertising commercial of metro or bus all the cabin is full of a commercial selling a brand My advice to your staff when this issue happens again is to The Air hostess on duty did not care and bothered to change my seat inspite of repeated requests with the change in Management it bounced back from the brink of disaster This was one of the most horrible experiences I have had recently many times spicejet flights are delayed so you can t really trust them if you have a connection flight today it was 6 hour delay then 3moor hours and the nicest part is that no one from this company bothered to take a responsibility and give us some place to rest or provided any drinks or food They dnt update any information regarding gate change flight delays on screen even the ground staff is terrible The start of flight was delayed by 20 mins but made up and ended up late by only 10 mins Very poor performance on part of the airline will remember never to fly with them again The staff was helpless as he was unaware of the excess handcarriage charges those airline guys are making at the boarding gate I was asked to cough up an addition Rs 16000 by SpiceJet authorities for their next flight to Mumbai which was at 6PM Leg room is a concern which i suffered while travelling an early morning flight I have lived through the worst phase of the airline in 2014 when cancellations were more common than on time flights worst experience travelling with spicejet in my life not a single consideration given I raised an issue with the airline customer service and they are still working on the same after a month I requested the Cabin crew if I can take 3 D as I was getting disturbed and the fellow passenger was also feeling bad When I rerturned I spoke to the gentleman in the next counter and while handing us our boarding cards he said you see our staff is under a lot of pressure but you should have requested for a supervisor Was most disappointed by the cabin crew It is very easy to say but difficult to go from here to there when you have next flight at 9pm Disorganised boarding and poor support from cabin staff results in uncomfortable experiences which add to the stress of flying I had left early than my flight time in order to give myself ample time at the airport If these cheap airlines can t manage then they should stop the service This carried on for an hour and the temperature inside was unbearable at last the flight left and reached the destination after delay of 3 1 2 hours Overall in one word Shocking Spicejet should be very disappointed with the service offer in such a flooded marketplace with budget airlines within India Even after repeatedly reporting it to two flight attendants one of which was the head of the crew did not pay attention My friend informed me later that one of the staff was slapped by a passenger so that s how bad the situation got I was traveling from Mumbai to Tirupati and when I bought a cashew nut from the cabin crew I was surprised to find a dead fly in the tin We told the Spice Jet staff that they could hold onto the checked in luggage or even hand it overA big argument arose and a staff arrived asking us to change seats my friend refused stating we were first in the check in counterhave not i requested to spice jet management pls care your plane The staff need to be trained to use common sense they act like dumb machines and follow a rule book At around 3 20 when anxiously with no info we asked few people one of your ground staff told that gate has changed to one on 1st floor One of a worst air travel experience i had wid spice when I traveled from delhi to bombay This is the Worst flying experience i had with Spicejet Earlier Spice Jet flights were delayed or cancelled but now they are on time and no more cancellations The flight landed very late and I missed my next flight for no apparent fault of mine Hard to find Customer Service attendant at airport The worst crew that I have seen in any of my travels While I personally did not encounter any real hurdles I heard a couple of passengers complain the check in counter staff were not professional The most important thing is the behaviour of the crew airport staff they don t know how to treat the customers they are very rude Why would I let go when I paid for my drink which was not served and taken back without any apology by the inflight staff We have been misguided from the staff and due to this we missed our flight I think this problem is only with Gorakhpur Airport as its being a new airport with fewer flights staff are in the typical mind set of like typical Government office staffs Spice jet if you think because there are not enough competitors you can act and behave the way you want Second Time Scary Check In Staff reached at 6 02 pm for a 6 45 pm flightThen don t worry customers have thrown many many renowned companies out of business because of their unfriendly customer policies If this is the way flight crew is supposed to behave then i will be reluctant to fly with Spicejet again So just converting Jet Airways plane into Speicejet wont bring service attitude in your staffsone of fellow passenger raised the complaint to one of the air hostess In general all online flights booking companies in India are a disaster Majority of the airlines I have flown into Its difficult for me to understand what exactly the cabin crew or pilot is saying in every first attempt such is the public address systems but inferring the rhymes looks on fellow passengers I am able to make out a tit bit of it from one destination to other and return same day with same flight is happening too often and every time i fly with spice jet i am floored with their on board service view they are simply superb i am afraidflight service was excellent through cabin crew members but what makes flight experience worst is quality of seats and leg spacing Just a piece of advice to the management if you know that the flight is delayed please don t let the passengers board the plane until the rescheduled time is decided Flight was on time but boarding was delayed due to slow processing by staff members Even the airline desk at airport looked like pavement hawkers trying desperately and looking pathetic despite their impeccable dress and flashy English to sell their products very patheticso i stand that time attendant come and tell me this flight is not take offPeople are buying tickets by their money but they are not getting any service then why people will spend their money for this kind of airlines For a 1 hour 45 Minutes flight they took almost entire flight time to serve the beverages food to other passengers As Jet airways is struggling due to financial crunch and Indigo is short of pilots started using Spicejet after a long time They did not want to accept it called management and left my friend and myself stranded there waiting for their good will Even after showing my ticket crew denied me the same The air hostesses on the flight acted like vendors selling food as they were only interested in selling food items even water was not served to the passengers Especially the delay of the flight leaving in the night beyond two hours becomes a great irritation and nuisance Because of technical issues they delay the on time flight many times It was raining at the time of boardingBoth times flights were delayed The staff just asked us to sit elsewhere and we were lucky to find two unallocated seats Though the breakfast was served timely the staff forgot about serving me the beverage and gave it to me ten minutes before landing The worst part is when you are herded into a hot airplane and the pilot is missing for a long time The service quality at the boarding gate was very poor Than helpless I approach Indigo staff he helped me to get my bag back helped me to reservation counter and spicejet staff no where to be seen at reservation counter two staff members chitchatting and asking me to wait for 5 mins as they have to finish handover When I took up the matter with their customer service which got escalated to the nodal officer which was later escalated to the Appellate Authority all of them refused to refund the fare difference Just as the flight was at take off speed the pilot aborted the take off and the plane did not leave until 10 40 AM i would like to give 5 stars to the service by Mr Adhunik and Miss I ended traveling in a rush for 4 hours to fill conveniently for Spicejet a plane to Delhi via Kolkata for the double the price instead of the direct flight to Delhi at 3 45 I read in the paper the next day that the plane did have a technical issue which happens but the I felt so abandoned with little to no real options proposed to help me get to my next connecting flight I found anxiety on the faces of staff The jet itself is not bad but the people and the services are very mediocre Counter staff was not helpful at all and the options provided were either a refund of the portion of the ticket or come back the next day to take the flight My cousin was to travel next day to Jaipur and their flight left 3 hours early and they were not even informed they lost entire day in Jaipur Their staff doesn t know how to behave Don t understand this logic of your crew members However the SpiceJet ground crew did not have the courtesy to announce what caused the delay Spice jet is using the grounded 737 s from JET airways the problem with spice jet is that they do not boast a proficient grounds handling team and their ground staff is not that courteous The problem with the flight started during the push back at Patna airport the flight was supposed to leave Patna around 3 00 p m but it auxiliary power failed and it took about 2 1 2 hour to fix the glitch during the time all the passengers were forced to remain inside the plane in the sultry summer Some passengers requested the flight attendants to open the doors which was not considered at firstI had a very very bad experience at the time of boarding pass counter worst airline mr ajay singh pl listen Staff is not even bothered I get only one answer gate is closed and book new flight my experience has been very bad with spice jet airline or may be this was the only aircraft The problem of the flight comes when it comes to comfort declined and stated contact airport staff quite irritating with their frequent calls to upgrade none of the airlines i flew with called me so frequently before a flight Took the 2am flight from DXB to BOM as it was way cheaper than a full service plane As compared to indigo these guys are on time and don t spike the flying time so that even after a delay the flight shows on time I got to the airport early and the desk was not staffed I asked someone in the company uniform and he gat me some incorrect adviceThe maintenance of the flight is worst than state transport bus International Spicemax Offering clearly mentioned on the Itinerary Complementary Meal Non alcoholic or Alcoholic beverage but getting such a respond from the staff sounded very unprofessional And the air crew was frustrated themselves At this point Mr Aman has his staff were showing their true face I have very bad experience regarding delay from schedule time in spice jet In to Flight Delays to Air Time Evening Flight of this Airline is always delayed by 40 50 minutes A lot of people had to make a lot of noise before the shift manager decided it was time to him to make an appearance We were quite satisfied with the service of Spicejet since we had less than an hour to catch our flight from Kochi to Male the Airline personnel escorted all the passengers from Domestic Airport to the Intl AP really appreciate their gesture as last year we unfortunately selected Air China for our US tour were stranded at Beijing AP while going coming back for over 24 hours they were absolutely rude has no culture of helping passengers other than their country after literally fighting with them they arranged accomodation in a hotel but I would like to suggest all of you not to travel by Air China had good experience of QANTAS JET Very recently INDIGO also Surely they are budget airlines making sure Jet gets a tough time I feel like never ever travelling with such airlines Basically they left us there to sleep on stone floors the staff was very unfriendly and not helpful at all so people if you don t want to lose lot of time energy and nervesNo special feel with those at all if the rest of the flight is less than mediocre The staff earlier said that if I reduce my luggage then I don t have to pay No help given to sole travellers most travel in groups also disappointed they did not offer the same service as Air India on weight for hold luggageTheir customer support and communication media is WORSTTTT While we were coming back the luggage stats for the same were 27KG and 13 KG respectively This Girl Spicejet Ground Staff at Kochi Airport Mariya put us into the over weight luggage penalty zone As per local airport staff this particular flight delays every single day Rather than trying to find solutions to problems the airport staff just repeats themselves over and over like robots When the pilot arrives he finds something wrong with the nose wheel Paid extra for spice max till jammu but did not get spicemax seats from delhi jammu sector after pointing out to the air hostess was told that it will be sorted out once u land in jammu at jammu airportI was very upset because the only SpiceJet employee we saw and who could have helped us was far too busy beautifying herself and having a deep conversation with a male I had a connecting flight of another airline from Chennai airport hence went in to talk to Spice Jet When other Airline in next counter can hear and respond Spice jet staff turned deaf First a delay was notified for 1hr and 35mins for operational reasons which changed the time from 11 05pm to 12 40am The flight time between Kochi and Delhi is almost three hours Not only that even at the check in counter the staff member kept trying to foist it off on me recounting the benefits and urging me to upgrade I felt at that moment as though I was in a KFC Burger King counter refusing the extra cheese toppings they are hell bent on selling me 2 We had atrocious turbulence throughout the journey which felt like the pilot had temporarily lost control Also the ground service seems to be haywire at Dubai airport they ask to put hand baggage back in check in when passengers are entering the flight saying they don t have space anymore Took the morning flight to Jammu yesterday to visit the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine and the flight was bang on time during both take off and landing Always Delayed staff are not supported No information is providing for delay by the airline staff Had just challenge with claiming miles because customer care couldnt followTerrible is an understatement sky high ticket prices opportunistic check in staff charged me for excess baggage at actual extra baggage worst seating arrangement in aircraft with no leg space for long legged passenger like me discourteous cabin crew worst flight ever taken by me Moreover when the same was brought to the notice of the cabin crew they asked us to file a complaint as if this was a daily affair for them Smelly inconsiderate and disturbing Not even worth mentioning that crew didn t have blanket or Cotton balls We phoned and were told that if we wanted to change to an earlier flight we would have to pay a fee this new flight would have us waiting at Delhi airport for approximately 8 hours Little did he know that the bone tired hostesses were jumping and running in the aisle all the time to complete their chores Poor experience At Delhi airport the staff at the counter asked for all the passports took a long while to examine them then gave us the green signal to proceed Flt 561 on 17 03 18 Seems it is not very unusual by the way staff at the Gate was responding to the queries of waiting passengers but the spice jet staffs was not allowing the baggage that too below 8 7 and a decimal we were late for the flight but staff members did not allow us to board flightWhen I entered for Priority Check in the staff in that counter didn t allow me without ask me anything SpiceJet is known for one good thing and tats their staff quality besides the fact that the flights usually get delayed Even the in flight crew were clue less what was happening and it was not our mistake that flight is rescheduled after calling to customer careIn flight Service Being no frill flight there was hardly any in flight service offered One bad thing about spiceJet is that flights used to get cancelled frequently but this was invariably a disaster for cabin crew and staff When we approached the Spicejet staff at the airport they refused to help us for priority check in On 12 the august the day of travel I received a message at 6 am informing the delay of my flight by 1hour 40 mts If women can t handle such nonsense then pls also have some male crew members alongside At boarding staff was weighing luggage of every passenger took this flight as it was matching the time and dint want to travel by road to Bombay airport where tickets for full service even Emirates airline tickets where cheaper the seat covers were tired off push back was not working seems like they are using there very old flight for the service in flight foodSecurity was calling for us because we were the last customers on the flight but still staff could not waive the fee International flight and this behavior by the airline shameThe flight attendants just chose to turn a deaf ear to it all The service offer from the crew on our flight was terrible and lacked any personality whatsoever they may as well been no crew on the flight as not even a basic hello orStaff are friendly although in flight service is slow so don t be in a hurry so i was sitting upright on requesting the staff present i got the most weird reply everWith no reason they delay the scheduled flights Just to add the flight SG635 was delayed by over an hour and the inflight quality of tables is shown below Ground staff was very politely telling me only thing possible is refund my money All this at the airport with very limited time for me to decide was also exacerbated by the English Hinde language barrier and the urgency of creeping time constraints plus I find it difficult to believe unless I am the first customer you have booked on a flight with SpiceJet that situation has not occurred before But after getting into flight i feel very bad by sawing it s food and services As I left the place upon landing I told the male senior flight attendant that such behaviour would not be tolerated on any other airline and that they should control their passengers we flew from varanasi to jaipur with no hassle and on time flight worst experience of my family trip had to madurai It feels like extreme vibrations during fly for few times cause of outside weather The in flight crew s morale seemed low Two hours we was into the plane and we are waiting for the pilot flight was on time just boarded the flight however airline insisted on priority check in and other add on services which are uselessWhen I mentioned it when I finally called after United Airlines canceled my flight due to Pakistan shutting down its air space 11 days before my departure the airline agent didnï ½t say anything However not a fan of the food delivered for the veg multigrain sandwich was barely eatable can be improved What really bowled me over is that I got a call from the airline airport staff proactively and they informed me about the wallet Since the next flight was in the evening I dropped the plan of rescheduling the flight Only gripe was that the ground staff were a bit rigid specially the ones at the Baggage screening section who made me open my bag meant forThose are valuable and we cant risking our flight to not miss as we have next day client meeting we had to leave The airline staff of SpiceJet at Surat Airport is not at all courteous or customer centrist I ve just booked flights with this airline and already not liking the service There were several passengers in the same situation The Spice Jet staff had no idea of how to handle this issue I forgot my mobile phone at the airport and SpiceJet got it delivered to my on the next available flight Staff at the counter sold to me spice max at the time of checkin The listed flight time was 1 hour ten minutes but flight time was only little more then 30 mts but inspite of that the staff and the crew members handled the situation well and after take off covered 20 mins Staff on this particular were so serious as they rushed through the service Nobody from the customer care answers the call It is a very unpleasant inconvenience for the passengers who abide by the baggage rules and wish to have a peaceful flight leaving at midnight Spice Jet staff refused without any reason I think they should learn from other low cost airlines in terms of customer services staff behavior and professionalism the staff is always busy in their gossips Flights run late Just a local Bus type facility food is very expensive and tasteless Catching an early morning flight is not a pleasant thing no assistance during the flight change at Kolkata airport no proper seat on my kolkata to bangkok flight An earlier flight mumbai to madurai was delayed by over 2 hours and the ground staff were unavailable at the scheduled departure gate for clarification We had to circle in the air for about 45 minutes so the flight reached lateThis isn t a review of the flight but of the airport I them realised that he had been chasing me out in favor of a crew member that needed the WC We were dumped with whatever the flight attendants felt like giving us On top of all this the management at Madurai airport was deplorable I approached a DANATA staff hanging around far from this belt altered them and then could received my baggage and all other baggage ofNever encountered this problem before on any Domestic or International flights for a ï ½ Check Inï ½ bag twice I had a experience of booking it and both times it got cancelled and when contacted company they give impossible options of alternate flight The crew is the biggest downside However even after reaching almost 2 5 hours before flight time according to the boarding pass dispatcher only middle seat was available across all the rows You have a very immature inexperience staff that need to be trained Small kids and their mothers were going and requesting the staff that we are feeling suffocating and please do somethingI think the ground staff allowed everyone to take as much luggage in the cabin as they pleased Overall no nonsense service with better than our expected service and food and on time arrival was something we saw and that is all we need don t we I didn t even get an acknowledgement of my flight from them one time Staff are not friendly very rude flight was late reason unknown we felt suffocation due to non effective Air conditioning systems which is common finomina during return all max amount gone wasteThe flight staff are pretty decent no windows nor aisle seats available There needs to be some kind of training for your customer representatives on how to deal with customers and show kindness and still abide by the rules Are these Spice Jet staff at Gorakhpur station getting some commission based on how much they have looted customers I wouldn t have traveled by air if I knew that it would cost me so high The check in was awful due to the fact that the airline staff demanded to see my credit card to compare it with the credit card used to purchase the ticket I was kept aside away from the queue and subjected to great embarrassment before rest of the passengers Spicejet is a good budget airlines but overall service is deteriorating Even when we were waiting there were no updates by ground staff no one was at boarding gate till last minute I was unfortunate enough to be on board todays flight and the lack of professionalism and courteousness shown by the Spicejet staff who are supposed to be the creamy layer of the Hospitality industry was astounding Nothing much with service involved but cabin crewIt is worthless flight service The crew did not offer a water instead they were focused on selling other stuff We paid almost 2200 per person for a return flight and it seemed alot to pay as we had no additional services included in terms of meals or priority services However the service was ok nothing great but not bad Our initial flight from Delhi on the 26 Dec 2017 was uneventful but i would like to commend the two young cabin crew that handled an extremely difficult local passenger Any enquiry from customers forwarding being ignored by superiors mean it is not ruled to accept reliable words to improve complicated situations in the flight schedule as well as ground staff too Spicejet supportive staff should take up some responsibility and talk to there customer and explain the issues they r facing in providing the check in baggages Being a late night flight we didn t feel cold as temperature inside aircraft and airport were regulated Not recommended for long flights and I had to spend an additional Rs 15000 extra due to last minute change of flight We were then asked to either stay back or cancel the flight ticket however we opted to take the next flight as we were helpless as there was no other flight to Pune and the Spice Jet staffs were equally helpless with no clue what needs to be done and were not at allThe flight left before time by 15 mins and covered the journey in 30 mins as against 50 mins announced by the Captain It is a budget airline company and it was the cheepest when I bought the ticket between all India and Sri Lanka The security personnel was not ready to accept our makemytrip document Crew members are not responding when we ask for water They charged me more before the gate to give me the premium economy but those chairs were in front of the emergency exit door and the back of the seats did not bend choice of food for in flight order is not much unless you pre book your meal The check in staff was almost accusatory in their tone and treated customer with scant respect Staff is very unorganized in flight boarding procedures with no preference given to handicapped and senior citizens We got the seats in front of the emergency exit which meant an extremely cramped seat with nonexistent legroom Inspite of a short flight all cold beverages were not available inspite of being on the menu which was paperboat The flight attendants were making faces to serve drinking water too which was not bottled too I would like to thank spicejet for wasting my one day itinerary of my trip and making me realize that this is worst airline in India It is as such so stressful to travel to Mumbai during rains adding the pressure of advancement of departure time that too in the early morning makes it worse Flight time was at 9 30 they closed checkin desk at 8 30 and on paper checkin time was 8 45 they didnt allow me to get in forcefully i was made to book next flight tickets out of no option There were no voice overs from the staff or pilot to explain what was going on no explanation on landing either Pre order a meal for a short flight else staff may not get to your order in time As our connecting flight with Air Asia left for Goa at 5 40pm we would have missed this flight and have had to get another one Unbelievably incompetent staff and inflexible with their policies Leg space between two consecutive rows in an aeroplane was very less making it difficult to seat comfortably even though flight time was only for 1 hour The staff were busy getting the flight off the ground and were not helpful in this regard The Air Crew was too slow in serving Due to lack of direct flight from Vijayawada people are facing problem to reach Pune from this area While the flight take off was delayed due to the delayed in coming flight from Delhi due to fog No apologize even no announcement been given If asking to staffs regarding the issue no such Apologize been instead of apologize they are talking very rude I had read very negative reviews of this airline and wanted a direct flight from Jaipur to Dubai at a budget rate so my 9 yr oldNone of the ground staff or the online staff had any clue of Aircraft configuration This was not an international flight so the refusal seemed arbitrary I requested the check in staff to allow me the same as cabin baggage since its arrival at Kolkata was at 22 30 hours When we questioned the staff all we faced was ignorance The aircraft is just there in front of us apparently there was no clearance to board it not even the crew who went there on time like everyone else The least that I expected was a slightly better service and or a refund or a credit for the next flight I called up customer care of spice jet saying that i wont be able to make it so help me for rescheduling on comp basis In Chennai airport my daughter and I were told that we were not eligible for food refreshment vouchers as the flight time was changed but not cancelled The staff also just doing their job as there is no other option I do not understand what has pick up time to do with actual flight requirement doesn t mean you hire staff who degrade experience late the staff has to understand that I have had the most disturbing and distressing experience with SpiceJet s ground staff at Rajiv Gandhi Hyderabad Airport while trying to board the flight SG 1215 from Hyderabad to Pune We were delayed due to an accident on the road and we were almost on the verge of missing the flight we were in constant touch with SpiceJet customer care about our status and as soon as we reached the airport the spice jet employees assured us of no worries they were able to check in our bags and ensured we were able to get our boarding pass and get to the flight I m really unhappy with the service will never prefer Spice jet again Service on flight was similar to the one one would expect of a budget airline The service of this flight is not so good The reason for the title is that the airlines doesn t have a uniform service standards ius up to the staff When many passengers asked same question from ground staff they had no answer Asked when the next flight was leaving and the manager on site Vishnu P he refused to provide me with his full surname said he had no idea silly chit chats were more important when there is a huge line of customers waiting I didn t had much expectation from it as it was a direct flight to Kochi when we were leaving the flight I requested for the stroller I was told by a crew lady with a very frowning face that it will come on the Belt The flight didn t have any In flight entertainment servicesAir hostess were high headed and did not even bother exchanging pleasantries Very uncomfortable experience when you are travelling with a kid and expect extra care from airline staff rather than additional trouble and focus on selling services Spicejet would do well to train check in staff to be courteous and prompt and not have an attitude problemIn flight service is fully dependent on the personnel not on the airline standard as while going the service was below average the staff seems disinterested however while on our return flight it was reasonably better When I got back to my seat as soon as I sat down a pilot or co pilot cane out of the cockpit in haste and went straight to the WC where I had been We do understand that cost is less for no or less services The staff knows no one can do a damn thing about them and they take everything for granted Feedback as follows SG 517 7th Dec 2918 Goa to Pune 14 00 On boarding the flight staff was too busy chatting among themselves and giggling group of 3 girls For a national airline the ground staff obviously has no training in charm and etiquette It was a morning flight and the complimentary meals were not that good We were with in the cabin and check in baggage limits but because of the executive lack of knowledge we had to pay extra for the luggage and send all through check in baggage Being a short flight there was very little time for service but the service is bit dull by comparing with other flights The ventilation air conditioning was not working it was suffocating almost don t know the reasons but no one was able to give a proper reply About gate change unprofessional staffand I was asked to pay 180 dirham from a unprofessional staff as I had 3 KG extra didn t work do not use horrible service after paying money Flt turned around after circling at Amritsar nothing served during the flt staff remained courteous Wheels were out however due to runway submerged with water we just went like a V Sharp uprise from the ground level nothing like this we have witnessed in last 10 years of flight travels There are no services at theï ½All in all the staff displayed a complete indifference and almost perverse pleasure in our plight of missing the flight All airlines are charging good enough for onboard food but not providing good service taste and quantity during journey The never on time SpiceJet should rename themselves to match their service horrible waiting hours usual of them wasted a day at destination reached early but all in vain I didn t buy any onboard food service When I called the customer care center they just apologized and didn t refund anything I could not spend another couple of days with my family in Bangkok who were already exasperated miserable due to the delay first for about three hours from around 3 50 AM to 7 AM Thailand time and finally the cancellation announcement around 7 AM of the late night flight The new system for inflight entertainment didnt work and the staff who told will come back didnt return at all The Thai staff at the SpiceJet BKK check in counter was no exception and was visibly condescending towards us who rather stupidly forgot the baggage policy of 25kgs and NOT 30kgs my friend had to stuff her Platheora of shoes from Pratunam market into my bagpack while this fiasco was going on the lady at the check in counterWhatever the reason for the delay the time and efforts of all passengers gas gone for a toss No apologies or anything from the staff They seriously don t value the time and money of the customer Flight took off late at 5 40 pm due to late arrival of incoming aircraft now a standard excuse of delays and arrived in Bengaluru at 8 pm The ground staff was not at all helpful when asked about the status of the flight ï ½Not a great flight Being a low cost flight I cannot comment on the in flight services but the crew seemed cordial The ground staff actually lacks customer guidance while boarding which eats up a lot of time and its irritating when you have Senior Citizens travelling along with you I requested the flight attendant to ask him to lower the volume it was done halfheartedly and the passenger continued with the nuisance till we landed Crampy aircraft staff unresponsive The crew took 45 mins to serve first 2 rows by the time it was to serve the 3rd row the plane had already started the decent the seat belt sign was on The flight doesn t offer any find of in flight entertainment except for the complimentary magazine it provides any consideration or announcement to board the wheel chair passenger first as a result of this my mother who has severe challenges to walk was made to board in the last and had to walk through the aisle with fully occupied rows where it is impossible to walk in this air craft without any assistance Hope SpiceJet makes note of such staff and Train them properly but they never deliver the service As this is a cheap fare Air service we could get only water as complimentary that too on our request numerous times emailed customer service they refuse to assist never fly on this airline That s because the service is not as great as Indigo Jet The online staff claimed that the seats were already allotted and we had no choice to request the staff to change to row 2 of the aircraft as recommended by the Airline staff online But there was zero piece of information announcement at boarding gate by their staff It was raining heavily and the staff did not organised for Bus initially the flight was delayed by 40 minutes then another display indicated a further 40 minutes delay after some time the ground staff indiacated that the flight would depart at 1800 hrs after an hour we were informed that the departure time would be 2100 hrs In flight service was also not that great They also had a couple of hours delay in Kochi but the staff wasn t even conveying the exact time that we had to wait I hope you will learn from this and make recommendations for your Goa staff to be retrained with higher levels of customer service and to deal with customer conflicts and resolutions otherwise your company will go bust in the near future Currently the only other carrier operating direct flights on DXB PNQ DXB is Air India Express the staff was not at all cooperativeand i noticed other people requesting the flight attendants if they could switch their places However customer service should never be lacking I find it very odd the cabin crew should be dressed from above their knees and it s somewhat unprofessional in my opinion The counter staff is not cooperative 25 min is left for flight departure which isAirline staff isn t polite either Now forgive me for making assumptions but i am of the opinion that had this happened in any other airline the cabin staff would have helped the passenger out I was about to miss my next flight from Delhi to Raipur No update from Airline members even not found in waiting area till 2120 hrs wherein flight scheduled to depart 2135 hrs Now at that late hour instead of helping passengers find local accommodation and transport on their own we were left abandoned and stressing for our shelter for the night The rest of the staff also understood my problem and upgraded me with no additional costOne small issue the feedback link sent by them after every flight has a question to rate their in flight entertainment which is currently not available and hope it must be coming up soon Pilot announced before time departure once the gate was closed the flight was stranded in take off que for more than 40 minutes with out any announcement passengers were informed only when we reached no 2 in que Also no staff will have the clue of this The ground staff was not at all helpful when asked about the status of the flight Delay in flights is one thing but the approach of airlines towards compensation for its passengers loss of time and its ground staff s impossible position in facing angry customers is beyond redemption A short late night flight but what a flurry of activity there were too much rush inside flight no management flight first delay due to boarding not systematic secondly became late by 1 hour when reached bengalaru thetThen she instructed a ground staff to escort me fast through security when there was a big queue and then to the boarding gate in time The staff are rushing through the service and therefore do not have time to attend to individual requests My idea not being harassing the staff or being rude in any matter I quietly showed the sample to the flight attendants took a few picturesFlight experiences had no flaws and no issue at all Just after landing the parent got up to take something for the kid from and the crew asked him to be seated Even their international flights do not even match any of the international flight standards and had so much trouble throughout the journey with this airlines so many times This being one of the cheap cost effective airlines it was an average flight All I wanted the international travellers to be wary of is that baggage allowance on domestic air lines was 15 kg per person i would not recommend spicejet to anyone unless you have no option pathetic service and departure was not on time but no one is ready to talk on phone as they started boarding of other flightDirty cabins pore flight crew broken environment Though international flight but seem like a domestic plane Their customer services are currently looking at my complaint however based on their initial response I have little expectation of any satisfaction and then almost 6 hours when called customer serviceThis is a morning service from Chennai bit more convenient than those graveyard wake up time flights Airline staff were using their whims and fancies for charging for hand baggage even that just before boarding the aircraft On reaching the airport well in advance the ground staff at the airport offered us two front seats on their own saying that the seats at the back are not together and that the front seats are more comfortable etc The seats seemed to be a bit tighter than on our previous flight and the cabin crew a bit more up tight I also was shivering due to the air conditioning and had to take a quick decision and booked an alternate flight on Thai Airways for Rs 76000 for 3 persons since it was a last minute booking which was the cheapest direct flight showing at that time The take off and landing of the airline is very rough After done with the security check formalities waited inside the lounge till 12 PM and no show of the flight Check in at Spice jet counter was smooth and hassle free with pleasant staff however after the aircraft took off after half an hour delay without any declaration regarding that The service was not great either If you have more than 15 kilos you may end up paying much more than flying with a regular airline The in flight experience was as usual very tight seats with very little legroomThe crew should have ear plugs or at least cotton plugs at least for children But I was told to pay for the seat if I want to change as if they will pick up a passenger in the middle of the air There was not even one SpiceJet staff to help us By this time to book a completely new flight had gone up to 15 000 rupees When asked about that they wont respond and tell customers to call online support and online support says to talk to ground crew Talking of boarding experience staff has no info on when the boarding would start and boarding never commence on time mentioned on the boarding pass Not a big fan of this airline services is satisfied counters only making delay to me Though I personally did not require the serviceDecent Indian internal flight not up to European standards Our time in Delhi should have been 3 hours which was considered more than enough to catch our next flight In reality there is almost NIL difference between the fare pricing between LOW COST FULL COST airlines Only the flight time availability makes all the decisions and it was my big mistake ever i made at the time of boarding all ordinary support and timing i observed also in flightBut the in flight experience was not that good On teh way back there was a medical emergency which was also quite well handled by teh cabin crew without much panic although looked like they were facing this sort od situation in rela life for the 1st time Challenging booking service website higher possibility of making an error 1 drunken pilot not allowed to fly 2 Well I think they need to buy new planes cause it was horrible to travel in those old Boeingï ½s else their ground staff is way better courteous at least If you want to connect to an international flight DO NOT trust SpiceJet My sympathies with anyone expecting any good out of spicejet customer care after reaching too much late from ahmedabad to chennai 2 days back now time to go to bengalaru all v passengers boarded in flight in time till 15 minutes no announcement when v asked they announce no pilot he is coming from hyderabad inpilots were inexperienced Overall it was a boring flight experience on the International route Was traveling on a late night flight scheduled to depart from Bangalore at 10 10 and it was delayed in normal process by around 30 mins and the same delay came about at the destination Since the flight was delayed for 1 hour no complimentary drink snacks or food offered by the cabin crew as a gesture of goodwill or to compensate the delay There is no air conditioning until you are airborne The flight was delayed and ground staffs are not in a position to inform the departure time and other relevant information Once it was my fav airlines but over the years the cost factor increased the service gone down site is not that user friendly The baggage allowance is only 15kg not enough when transferring from an international flight where the allowance is more than double that Spicejet caters for budget travellers it has average internal decor the timing of the flight was delayed for departure but the internal service staff do a reasonable job When we finally board the plane the pilot announces that he doesn t feel comfortable flying the aircraft because there s a problem with landing gear it was not my first flight so travel only if you are planning on saving of transportation costs but do not buy the BS priority serviceThe airlines seems to be only interested in selling various goods and facilities like seat location leg space priority boarding a farce anyway food merchandise etc etc at exorbitant rates rather than providing basic services to the customers I had a very most unpleasant experience on my first Spice Jet flight Must tell you your crew members have lot of attitude and this wont help in long term This attempt is made in a very dishonest way by claiming that the flight is full even if you are at the airport 2 3 hours before departure and a seat close to the front of the aircraft is not available No customer service whatsoever to advise in the confusion of Kolkata Airport with the Gate NumberSpicejet is one airline that has taken airline cheating to new heights in india Unhelpful crew did not make any attempt to serve me my prepaid dinner in 1 hr did not help me in getting space for my cabin baggage promised to changeit and did not promised to bring it to me after landing but did not air hostess The SPICEJET experience was below average as its a budget flight operator The boarding process seemed a bit hassled but except for Jet Airways I ve had the same experience with most airlines on early morning flights so I won t pull them up for it The crew members needs to be a little more polite Called the customer service atleast three times for a correct answer long waiting As we went at the check in counter staff was not at all presentable she was in her own world Food served quality is also good but punctuality air craft not upto markA short comfortable flight from Dehradun to DELHI Cabin crew was huge considering there is very little on board assistance needed The service of the staff was really average as there were just 3 attendants for the entire aircraft which i believe was not enough for a passenger aircraft carrying approx 180 passengers One time the pilot inform us that the flight was delayed due to technical difficulties which they did not have control on it but the actual facts was that the tire of the flight was being changed which took us so long to take offFlight attendants are more attentive of late indigo jet airways etc were operating with only a slight delay in services finally the ground staff indicated that crew had to come from delhi to cater to the aircraft as crew could not reach the airport and spare crew was not available The Ground Staff were not Cooperative in giving information I called up the Customer Care and requested to change the flight to 5 40 PM which is available just so that the risk of missing the connecting flight is less we were boarding flight we waited for cleaning staff to get down airhostess was instead of welcoming the passengers at the rear gate was busy talking over accounts of number of supplies of cuppa noodles and biryanis 3 I bought on board snack Cabin crew seems to be running entire time for dont know reasons I could not fault the service of Spice Jet And it hardly look a international flight The in flight service was ok not matching to international standards when I contacted the customer care team they offered a partial full refund of just Rs 702 in total When we arrived at the airport the check in staff told us the flight would be rerouted through SIlchar IXS for operational reasons The staff clearly lack etiquettes amd direction This has resulted in pre poning of my flights both onward and return with Spicejet inorder to avoid payment of double amount to alternate airlines Just because Spicejet is one of the few or lets say one of the only 2 3 airlines that have a direct flight from Pune to Dubai they have assumed and taken for granted that regardless of the condition of the aircraft kind of seats filthy atmosphere and carpets etc we will as passengers endure bear and not complain about the same Not much to recall about the in flight experience It felt like a local bus than an international flight Old aircraft below average service not so nice air con system all in all the same feeling of having that delay same level of feeling inside the cabin I was travelling from Madurai to Chennai to catch an international flight the attitude of the staff managers were pathetic Obviously they have not been taught how to take care of their customers It s a busy flight After paying for my meal I am returning without having my drink is this the service you offer to your privilege guest extremely pathetic They will not book you on the next available flight and say you have to buy tickets again at the ticketing counter It would be nice if staff could be more pro active in announcing such delays While there are no stand out features to any of their flights across the routes in southern and northern India that I have flown their staff is courteous flights smooth and no frills at all They used old aircraft with no effort to rectify seats and improve service On requesting to be accommodated in their next flight in that route as a compensation their straightforward response was a NO WE CAN T DO Unfortunately one of my bookings didn t go through the complete process of booking and the transaction was canceled as confirmed by the Spice jet customer care Never have I ever got the opportunity of visiting a screwed web checkin service like SpiceJet By the grace of Almighty the staffs at the boarding counter guided me to the boarding gates and helped me catch my flight This was cheapest flight on the date with good cabin crew and stop was at chennai for 3 hours but its totally smooth and comfortable process It was a direct flight initially it was delayed by half an hourThe service quality in flight was also along the same lines they are so lethargic that there were multiple flight attendants talking to a customer Not a bad airline But I am not satisfied with the services Usually I do not fly in spice jet airways as it is usually unpunctual lacks customer services Ms Krishna Budhadev needs to learn about customer service she is not fit to be at the desk arrogant with a huge attitude Ground staff should have been responsive enough to keep the customer informed about the gate number I had breakfast in the Chennai airport so didn t opt for onboard services I frequently travel into different airlines across the globe and spicejet is the worst among them After reaching at airport the sms came 4 pm that your flight is delayed due to operational reasons and will now depart at 8 05 pm and after waiting for so long again it was screened that the flight will be depart at 8 50 pm Unprofessional staff Apparently spice jet has started serving alcohol on their international flights and boy did these guys enjoy their drinks Boarding time mentioned 4 45pm whereas ï ½boarding last call announcedï ½ at 4 45pm resulting in last min run when there was a long queue inside the connector from airport to aircraft of more than 50 people Last Sunday took a late night flight from Mumbai to Chennai in SpiceJet Their cabin crew seemed to be so untrained and couldnï ½t find a single smiling face throughout the flight and mostly rude crews commanding passengers Even after showing the lead flight attendant the receipt they refused us one of the meals There was no intimation of flight details neither on the Spicejet counter display board nor any staff has helped And please ask your ground personnel making PA announcements not to scream but to speak softly and slowly so that we can understand what is being said I said that I don t want any such extra add on service and only wanted an aisle seat if available Well he did not let me shift from an normal centre seat to the next aisle seat in spite of the aircraft carrying not even 50 load The boarding pass had no gate number printed security staff could not help with gate number there was no announcements that we could hear She said will give some warm water however she never came back and the kid didn t have a pleasant flight Coming to the in flight experience the staff is always rude arrogant and carry that horrendous look on their face The cabin was poorly lit in a very large aircraft the service was matter of fact and it was a fairly soul less experience This is the only option to fly early morning no direct flight before this And your staff do not help much but give dirty looks The staff at the check in counter also make a serious attempt to sell the preferred seat at extra cost I have experience of 2 3 times while airline staff is polite on this and giving that incoming airline arrival late leads to dalay in departure of Pune Flight When I reported this to customer service no apologies It s just not a pleasure to travel in air in India these days Then after luggage from Air India flight was cleared they traced and put up our luggage on the carousel and that after nearly an hour Once the price of the air ticket goes up not many will choose this airline Support staff not very supportive The cabin crew had no control what so everbut their inflight experience sucks their staff attitude is as high as the altitude of their airplaneThis time was unbearable this could be reduced and the flight operators should think about it SpiceJet is a low cost airline It is the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried its ok for economy class and rate also down compare to other airlinesMe and my wife reached Kochin intl airport around 2400hrs on 25th March 2019 due to some technical reason check in was very slow and immigration clearance took almost 1 hour due to rush we couldn t make our usual visit to priority lounge airline insisted us to board our flight SG17 directly our seats were assigned on 17 E and F flight departed one hour late from Kochin it was comfortable cruise without much turbulence flight crew served our dinner against cash payment took almost 4 hours to land in Dubai Landing in dubai was very smooth no jerk better than EK AI or Air Arabia some body from Mumbai or Manglore air port employee they have cut my bag and taken the packet in day time I ve flown by Spice multiple times the hospitality extended by the crew wasn t upto the markThey don t even give you a good connecting flight The flight was good but the crew were too busy with so many things Subsequently a phone call to their customer service center in India resulted in a casual verbal apology with the suggestion that the complaint should be made to their customer service department The next airline rates are rocket high with no option for me but to cancel my plans and following that all my connecting flights Only problem faced when I tried to web check in they have only paid web check in seats which management should look into This flight is don t have any in flight service nor Entertainment and I was not transferred to any other seat by the crew citing the reason that the aircraft was full Unfortunately this message didn t make it to the cabin crew on the second leg Other airline company Indigo there were plenty of employees to advise they tried to contact a Spice Jet employee so did a policeman to no avail The ground staff are very unreliable and they do not even have the courtesy to arrange for conveyance to take you to the nearby town where you can make alternative arrangements for transport these small airports are far away from the towns Our flight was delayed by an hour not because of technical fault or bad weather but due to lack of management skillsHowever the crew assured us that we won t miss our connection to Male Just because the price is economical doesn t mean the service should be below average However Ground staff at check in were rude and not customer friendly but the crew members weren t hearing I will never fly such airlines Unfortunately the only airline operating a direct flight in this route The pilot makes an announcement that the air conditioning will be on when the flight will take off delayed departure unable web check in chaos at check in counter staff not courteous delayed departure as well arrival no proper communication on thisAir craft was too noisy it seems that it need maintenance The Airline has unilaterally cancelled all the tickets and rescheduled the flights and forced me to revise my journey inline with the availability of their flights in line with my engagements at Hyderabad Finally when reached Delhi T1 to my surprise the staff starting dislodging food trolley rather passengers and that felt bad since now I could feel who was important for Airlines Good budget flight on time economy seats are not great very ordinary The flight performance departure and arrival was good no complaint there However all the airline staff in craft was really Amateur or unprofessional and the craft interior was also not in good shape Although not as brillant and extraordinary like JET neither simple and economy minded like IUndigo Air Spice Jet has its true different elegant class and a incredible cabin crew staff I will never recommend anyone to use the services of spicejet Good budget flight Flight was bit delayed but managed to cut the time Crew Service is also not upto the mark It seems that Spicejet doesn t care about aircraft maintenance Onboard service When I asked customer care what option I do have they simply dropped my call I called again with angry toneEven the long hair crew members didn t make the bun Pilot and supporting crew seemed new extremely hard and uncomfortable landing The staff didn t seem happy and it was a mix of SpiceJet and Corenden crew A good experience though it was 30 minutes delay on take of but the pilot managed to cover the time and landed on time Just than they served another fallow passenger with hot beverage hence i asked the crew why was I not served hot beverage though they served the other passenger While the lack of service you experienced is unusual and not the standard of our airline in flight experience was not good because I was made to change my seat against my wish We were travelling with our Travel Agent who went to see the SpiceJet Airport Manager who verbally abused him for having the audacity to challenge him For for each time the air hostess said ï ½due to technical reasons no food or beverages will be served After about a delay of 1 30 hours it took off without even an apology from the Captain or the Crew Neither did they provide any kind of help to get me to my destination with the ground staff both at Kolkatta and Bagdogra just smilingly saying that they could not help Flight was delayed due to Airport Congestion however the pilots did their best to minimise the delay Ground staffs at check in counter and air hostess lack of service mind and I pointed out the inconvenience to the air hostess she actually shrugged and said that he has an option to go for the premium seats on a payment of course I do believe I was the only American on this flight but felt no discomfort or lack of service your flight was not on time kept flyers guessing your ground staff just keeping gossiping amongst themselves with no update or info No staff to help and advise from which belt to collect luggage No facility of entertainment They rescheduled the flight before 3 days of departure and made a afternoon flight to early morning flight If you need leg room in this low cost airline flight of approximately 2hrs and 45 minutes duration select the Spicemax service at an additional cost I hope SpiceJet will learn from this and retrain their staff to de escalate such situationSo if you want a pleasant experience plan in advance and make sure you don t get into a situation where expectations are not met Ground staff at the boarding gate in Delhi lacked basic CS skills and a robot could have done a better job The journey was much shorter than the reported duration of flying time I wouldn t recommend flying SpiceJet we only took them because of limited options for a direct flight between Jaipur and Dubai We did have our priority seat booked eventually obtained begrudgingly by the crew the flight eventually took off well over an hour late I chose their late morning service because the other airlines flying were all arriving in the late afternoon The most irritating feature of this airlines are the premium add on features where facility you need is charged additional including getting a corner seat which looked cheap Regis Mumbai when I encountered this airlines service no food tea coffee drinks Seats highly uncomfortable as per standards of international flight but i just couldn t used it as it was not able added to any of my onboard value added services wastage of money No one takes responsibility Also the In flight Food Beverage services should be priced similar to a local sector and they should not charge a premium just because one is travelling international Spicemax advantage was only limited to early check in while real benefit of lwg space as travelling with kids was not given even after 10 days of flight the refund is nowhere This airline appears to be totally unreliable simply avoid taking it in particular if you take separately in addition to an international flight When it got further delayed exhausted I asked the in flight attendants to upgrade meBook with Indigo and pay the full fare this was based on a full refund of the spicejet flight SpiceJet may get you from A to B but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues prepare for a time consuming fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience Also they are not at all flexible on any part of airline services i felt i have made a mistake by choosing Spice Jet when there are other options available for this travel sector I spoke to the manager on how his staff doesn t info the customer well so don t expect much hospitality or comfort Food beverage service was bound up swiftly after that none of passengers got hint of that Earlier their aircraft s looked refurbished and repaired water leaking bad service delays etc I would not say that it s not a good airlineNeither any announcement nor any display regarding boarding in aircraft was made even just before 30 minutes of scheduled departure and this has created an air of confusion among the waiting passengers Over the years especially after change of it s top management Spice Jet has improved it s customer service however much more remains to be done They are not here to provide their service to the customers but to earn money by giving the target to ruin the people and earn money I had very bad experience with this airline very tiny plane no good facility was available this ticket was booked by our organisations s travel agent and have told them never to book me with SG again The flight took off late but much to the glee of the pilot he announced We have once again landed before time Please at least do not fly to Kozhikode and leave the space so that some other good companies can take over Once we booked our flight with Indigo Spice jet staff then told us they would only refund the return leg and not the whole journey do not understand time value of passengers Also expedited staff apathy on my recent Tirumala flight so I believe it is the lack of customer orientation and empathy that is at play and there is no in flight service available if you have not paid extra services No reaction again from the Spicejet crew staff has no intention to help you There not a single SpiceJet staff to guide or help us But the crew is not interested in that The management by the ground staff is not at all good I informed them about this mistake the airline staff told me that my money will be refunded within 24 hours I ve been calling the customer service for the past 2 days with no sort of any response from your end finally I was able to connect with the customer service after 2 long daysWhat matters is that the crew did nothing but waited for 1 5 hours after the boarding was finished pilot is not available he is coming from delhi I wish all the beat in carrier to entire team of ground staff and inflight crew and wish special appreciation by airline to crew like raktima I was not able to pull up the seats during take off when i informed the crew about this they laughed and said no problem you will not fall down Sangeeta continued to be courteous and kept me waiting at your desk for an hour and a half and was unwilling to provide customer service on any level SpiceJet does not operate any frequent flyer programme and does not provide any in flight entertainment options It being a small flight is really time consuming to help people in wheelchair off the flights The fault lies here not in the stars that is the pilots and the crew but in the equipment SpiceJet has moved away from the typical low cost carrier service model of economy class only seating The cabin crew or captain did not bother keeping us informed of what s happening even during worst turbulence and AC failure Crew were not interestedChandni the staff kept telling our baggage was overweight and had to pay for the soaked baggage as well inspite of us being drenched in the rain There was no proper coordination between the staffs and no proper transport was provided to us non AC cabs and an age old Bus to shuttle between hotel and airport Flight delayed no staff to provide information i wrote to their customer relations team and no one cared to respond In general the attitude of the air stewards and stewardesses was not really helpful Check in was conducted with Indifference to the host of lined up passengers several check in Staffand they dont have staff to help me This flight is not preferable on the international route my flight was connecting via Kolkatta and no crew was there to guide the passanger about the transfer connecting flight details Airlines try to provide better service cost you pay there is nothing much you expect its budget airlines In my view one aspect which needs improvement is the way the airline staff welcome you to or from the flight the attitude should be more humanistic rather than proffessional Then the air hostesses were in their own world and were never caring Poor things kept slipping and skidding meeting the demands of their job Very poor ground staff Wonder why DGCA allows such airlines to fly which are a health hazard for the passengers health Finally I found a staff and he offered me a refund 7 10 working days or ticket two days later which he cannot promise The staff doesn t go out of their way to help passengers as far as I have seen but as with the water one probably has to ask for that too Goa No service even when I was traveling with Baby The only response we got was an automatic response that our complaint was received despite many requests for update Also do not use flying for many of the routes with short travel time and good communication ve s No AC until take off cabin crew performance No any issue relating to flight and crew members Good serviceSurprisingly cabin crews didn t pay attention to it I hope SpiceJet cares for the health of their passengers I and my wife were aghast to see this negligence from SpiceJet No staff was present at the boarding gate for any kind of help Booked one month before and got really good prices for the flight it was an early morning flight thankfully the ground staff started boarding early take off was a little shaky as the weather was not good got window seat luckily Due to poor visibility although the flight take off was half an hour delay with their nice hospitality of the crew members of the aircraft we never found any irritation I doubt their claim of being the best on time flight may the others are all worse than them in that case Prashant and Aditya are two counter clerks at Jabalpur who have no idea what good customer service is We had a good flight its less than an hour travel so didnt expect much They dont have a good specific lounge or area or even a courteous staff but you will never get response from them what a nice customer careI never had a delay and staff is generally nice considering that this is a low cost airline Unpleasant crew members not even a smile on face And last but not the least their flight staff serves with a smile which is mostly missing these days The flight crew were making fun of her in front of all that lady was not able to understand as the crew was talking in Hindi There were around 20 kids crying and few dozen senior citizons trying to survive and suffocating for the fresh air Too bad about the rest of the passengers who were trying to get home on time The main reason is the lack of flavour in food and lapses in services although the cabin was comfortable and spacious Customer service is Rude Absolutely disgusting service so the staff had a busy time of it and Iâ This airline is always really bad at customer service Worst customer service at the tickiting counter This probably was the worst service we ever experienced Did not expect Etihad to be so ruthless and please pay attention to the kind of people you hire some of your inconsiderate and rude employees are ruining the reputation of your company and will soon run this to the ground I only booked it with etihad since it was the cheapest worse food ever rude crew sometimes the just ignore you We did not pay for being accused as your illegal passengers based on your ground staff s assumption no proof They give incorrect â adviceâ Customer service are useless and hang up on you when you ask to speak to a manager The worst customer service EVER Absolutely appalling service from etihad Itâ s a 13 hour flight without immediate access to water so I have to bother the flight attendants constantly half the time they never actually come back with water for what Worst airline by a huge margin I would never ever fly with etihad again just really really bad service Worst flight ever â One of the worst if not the worst airline I have travelled on the sad part is that they are trying to place themselves in the same class of Emirates please save us the laughs Travelling on business class from Jeddah to AucklandBUT when I reached the airport to check in my luggage and their staff gives me the worst news It was shocking to see that the service staff is extremely rude and arrogant with passengers no different massive queues rude attendants rubbish food When all of us were already inside the terminal again and stood next to him this same terrible arrogant male staff of Etihad skinny with brown suit a bit blonde hair did order us rashly to step a bit far from him and he continued servicing other passengers Customer service was rude and arrogant Terrible customer service food is shocking the let you sit at a gate for an hour the 15mins before boarding tell everyone to leave because they hadn t done the security checks A FLIGHT WITH A NEW PLANE AND AN INCOMPETENT CREW The service was patheticWhen we asked for our money to be refunded the airline agents refused terrible flights packed in like animals at a slaughter house whilst empty seats elsewhere on planeCustomer service are pathetic and the staff onboard were rude and did nothing to help or to explain the situation Their service is atrocious we pulled out our luggage and we fixed the weight they allowed us for and left with hug disappointing service we have faced very rude and arrogant worst customer service received and totally disappointed from Etihad even if is not the first time Even members of the Ethiad staff at the airport were admitting that the overbooking policy was ridiculous yet when I complained via the form I was simply told that no compensation other than the voucher would be offered and that they look forward to welcoming me on another Ethiad flight soon Airline staff is rude and will not think twice beforeâ staff was so rigid and arrogant they refused to change my seat and asked 90 after 1 hour new offer was 60 if i want that seat such a inhuman staff many nearby travelers saw this drama and offered help to me Very rude customer serviceRude staff completely unorganised not limited to a particular airport either useless in both Manchester and Abu DhabiThe staff on the ground was unresponsive and rudePathetic service Pathetic food Staff were rude and no manners The staff attitude is arrogant rude This time though we had the opposite terrible and cheap food and the service is almost nonexistent although toilets smelled of pee and the service was very poor One of the worst flights ever coming home Itâ s clear that this means absolutely nothing to them and their customer service is pathetic I could not condemn them enough The ground staff was extremely rude the staff were very rude and unhelpful I asked would it be possible to be moved to a closer seat to my friends and was told by the hostessBad service rude staff I was really put off by this terrible service One of the worst airport in terns of management Traveling all my life but never seen such an an unprofessional rude slow boarding crew at the Toronto airport Been flying for more than 32 years and with almost all of the major airlines but this was one of the worst airlines in the world and must be avoided at all cost Very bad serviceTheir customer service is pathetic worse than the many budget airlines I have flown with This a bad airline and whoever is running it should be ashamed I had heard so much about how good this airline was WRONG service was terrible food average and the experience at checkin especially at JFK was not good Staff also are very rude treat you like you are traveling for free Pathetic food quality rude staff at airports and in plane The main lack lustre is your crew staff with arrogant behaviour and racism attitude Flight was only a third full and wanted to move seats to give me more leg room Cabin crew manager was rude and refused to let me me move to exist seat even though none of the exist seats were beingâ This flight also seemed a bit old crew seemed tired screens were very old and lagging AVML was served Indo Chinese The staff were very rude to several customers that moved to different seats as the plane wasn t full We are a family of regular flyers and are disgusted and upset by the treatmentStarted off badly as staff at Manchester was rude and unhelpful although I had assistance booked the lady insisted I put my hand luggage into a box thing which she could clearly see it fittedThen the arrogant male staff I forgot to ask his name finally handled us by asking all our passports Took a 14 hour flight toilets were filthy and staff were unhappy and unwilling to help I had a very horrible and nasty experience with the staffs in the check in and luggage area in Heathrow airport Very bad Service donâ t know where to start from Ground staff were extremely rude and unhelpful At no time was any communication given and the arrogant rude manner of this particular man up set many of the passengers who were fuming at his attitude it is really embarrassing and regrettable that someone in their management has allowed this to happen Staff are really rude food average and comfort really basic They are outside of any regulative authority at Abu Dhabi and can get away with a terrible service Staff pretty rude and unhelpful I complained to a staff but she claimed that I was wrong One of the worst flights ever flight from Hydrabad was turbulent over 3 hours I have explained to airline staff 5 five times that this is not a Golf set but a GIFT I and my wife traveled from New Delhi to Abu Dhabi on 24 1 19 on morning flight at 9 am had very bad experience the air hostesses were very rude and the food was the bad in tasteGround staff for our flight was pretty useless The staff on JFK were always very rude and un organized The service was very bad and all staff is rude Following is the list of issues I faced right from time I boarded 1 Extermly unwelcoming n highly rude flight attendants 2 Very tiny food portions and only 1 times food was severd in 9 hours flights No empathy worst customer service Toilet facilities lacking in cleanliness soap and hand freshener Not great customer service and really crap security on flights apparently dirty as no one care to put the trash in the plastic bag and the food Well their services is one of the worst Rude air hostresses with no manner We will be taking this matter further as it canâ t possibly be legal to refuse a paying customer that purely relies on your duty of careHowewer there was an extremely bad smell from the toilet during the entire flight and a very cold Air conditioning Airline check in staff were extremely rude I was informed I have to check in my luggage or leave it Etihad was one of the worst airlines that I have flown However it was disconnected with an Error loading page for the first 3 hours of the flight and it became connected in the remaining flight hours Bad service delivered by annoyed staff with inedible food Staff less rude Absolutely no problems when actually flying with Etihad however their customer service is appalling The worst staff behaviour Worse airline and terrible air hostesses The service from Etihad personnel at HYD airport was terrible they made us to stand and wait for more than 3 hours even though they knew that the flight is overbooked The airline should make sure that the staff is trained to deal with customers not in a rude manner I wrote to the customer service and only thing they have to say is they are sorry From checkin to food and also the rude crew all were an issue The flight attendant is slow and rude food is cold and no taste over priced tickets I will make sure not to use this airline in the future14hr flight was delayed by 3hrs we sat in the plan for 17hrs that too with a 2year old no food no water service was terrible the attitude that air hostess have is even worst Unprofessional crew complaining about passengers in front of me whilst queuing for the toilet The in flight service is awful The flight was fine with newer planes but the customer service is pathetic which takes the whole experience down Bad customer service unorganized luggage claims inefficient crew Terrible customer service Worse airline ever rude crew lousy food substandard entertainment If you want to buy an extremely expensive Business Class ticket and receive the worst service possible make sure to fly Etihad Terrible customer service would never fly again Also the behaviour of the ground staff was pathetic The ticket counter staff was not helpful and rude we are stuck in Abu Dhabi at a worst hotel called Mafraq terrible food for vegetarians in this hotel Really bad service lounge is closed and the given opening hours will not match They just cheat and very unethical staff and airlines The service was terrible one drinks service with the hot meal on each flight Their customers service advisers are very rude and mischievous bad experience I wouldn t advice anyone to travel by Etihadâ Form terrible booking and seat allication to horrible rude stuff and no regards to maintain time ours were 1 3 hr late made me miss connection Etihad has to be one of the worst airlines in the world The ground staff is extremely rude and unprofessional at the Pearson airport Really shame on this service No bar stale food and very rude staff Also the customer care was very rude and unhelpful to me I complained about the inappropriate behavior from the check in staff the previous night and was told to email them I had an awful flight as the result of an unruly loud and foul mouthed passenger who was sat immediately in front of me and created a significant and unpleasant disturbance over an extended period The behaviour of the counter staff was very bad attitude The supervisor was obviously supporting their staff and refused an apology The complaint service was very poor too One of their cabin crew member only served male passengers but Etihad have ignored this when I complained and said I should have asked to be served by another member of crew why should I be discriminated against because Iâ m female and Etihad think this is acceptable Their service was appalling and this is worst business class flight I have taken and will never ever fly with them even there is no any other airline was awful and mayhem and the airport staff didnt seem to know whatâ They ignore questions refuse to elaborate and barely apologies for a member of their staff abusing their position and asking for personal information Please do help us in getting the refund since it was the rude behaviour of the airport staff at the checking as we were ready to pay for the excess luggage that made us to miss the flight The food was ok but not wonderful and service terrible Service at the airport and in the air was awful The cabin was over heated and the staff was coached by a rude male chief Check in at Pearson Airport was poor with rude staff and no signage of where the line starts and which lines to choose If we hadn t and the person in front had reclined then it would have been a terrible flight Your customer service is useless One extremely rude member of staff dealt with us who was nothing but arrogant about the whole situation Crew is very rude and helpless I did not ask to set such stupid facility to get grilled by pathetic unnecessary interrogation like i am some criminal Each time we asked to be put together the staff were cold bordering on rudeJust had a trip to Egypt and this airline caused a total of 3 missed connections not to mention the HORRIBLE customer service The air hostess was surly and rude and the food was very poor Food was however diabolical the worse airline food I have ever had worse than Air Tarom Rumanian airlines in its communist heyday Very bad costumer service staff are very rude and unhelpful no smile no assistance at all Awful flight and staff The flight stewards were rude all four flights to everyone unapproachable I was in total shocked of how rude the flight attendants were Small flight delays were compensated in flight As if that wasn t bad enough Etihad s guest relation service even refused to credit us back the upcharge that I had paid This has to be one of the worst flights ever Air quality was poor on the flight Staff had no control or willingness over children screaming and misbehaving on the flight from hell The worst part was that not once did any of the airline staff acknowledge that i was sat in vomit nobody asked if I was ok with itThe tone of one of the staff seemed quite rude while going Service on board as off board is crap and dear god please make me never ever have to arrive to Belgrad airport Rude flight stewards to broken tables to seats that wouldnt recline I m not looking for compensation but feel they should be made accountable for a really bad service Worst airline I have ever flown Their terrible service unfriendly staff and advantage taking policies made flying Etihad the worst travel experience I have ever had Etihad s cabin crew is rude and off putting Again the staff seemed irritable and rude but for the relatively short 5hr flight this was bearable staff were down right miserable and rude service was poor and the food fair at best yet another example of shabby customer service from the once leading airline Etihad who cancelled our flight gave us another one which meant an extra nights stay in a hotel and Â 200 in lost wages pathetic service and pathetic drivel from your customer services departmentAnd we get this kind of worst service You have really let us down with terrible customer service The attendants were very rude probably never seen so rude air hostesses on any flights whatsoever Really poor service and attitudeI have previously replied to an email from Mohamed Kamil stating that we feel that the 10 000 air miles you offered is being refused as it is quite an insult for what WE all suffered through this experience of such bad service and lack of support I am 75 year old disabled man very bad services and experience in etihad rude staff at boarding gateThis is considered to be a very bad service from my p o v but unfortunately the crew refused to accept it I was disappointed with the behaviour of staffSadly at the end that arrogant male staff with brown suit and blonde hair still kept trying to make more argumentations with us by defending himself nor apologizing for his accusation to 7 of us Terrible service terrible food dirty aeroplane and the least legroom of the Middle Eastern airlines I remember well our first experience and it was not one to brag about terrible spicy food and a poor standard of service on such a long flight Although the flight was good and food and in flight service is good the ground staff every where is very bad all a front for bad service One of the cabin crew members tried to push my seat from the behind slightly only to retort with you need to push you seat from the front or else my back will break Staff respond to complaints by saying they fly anyone who can afford to pay Extremely poor service I m not sure if this was a one off bad flight but Etihad business class is well below par to other business class flights I have experienced on Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Exceptionally poor flight and even worse complaint handling by this airline I cannot even describe the disgusting level of service that Etihad Airways offers the way some of the staff spoke to passengers was just awful The staff insists that she will not be able to have one Crew member was very racist she is helping the people of her back ground and language Rude employee and manager they dont help youPure ignorance and lying flight attendants Bad attitude of staff Transfer Help Desk is totally useless here not offering any convenience and not helping you out with your flight arrangement if your family require anything special The airline staff are the rudest that I have ever seen flying from US to India When I awoke the baby had stopped crying but the old man sitting diagonally opposite me was coughing his guts up into paper and putting it into bags and passing it to the staff to take away Still the worst airline food I have ever had before The staff at Perth Airport were rude slow and treated any passenger not in Business as barely worth the effort to help When I pointed out I had in fact booked the entire flight on etihads website he basically called me a liar that I booked with virginThe Business Class experience with ETIHAD was extremely poor and stressful Never ever ever had such worst and arrogant staff interaction with Etihad ever Worst airline ever Staff refuse to provide food according to dietary needs for the 38 hours 45 minutes travel using theâ Ethiad service cannot be any worse than this Old cramped poor service and horrible food We felt treated like stupid people because we were asked by the crew member to look in our seat pockets to the point in the middle of my explanation my partner close to vomiting got frustrated and raised her voice to the crew member Worst Customer Service Centerbut I really had a terrible flight I can officially say they are one of the worst airlines No assurance fro staff Had to pay more because of a lying staff at Bangalore Extremely poor customer service they would not care to reply to you in case of any problem Terrible service very bad food and the plane is extremely out of date Very pathetic service between lahore to Abu dhabi it is a very bad service and management I and the five other people will never travel with them ever again we were genuinely disgusted with their customer service and how I was treated Food and service poor And the airport staff or etihad staff at the counter blames me for being late that is why i was not able to make it Yep Etihad no longer takes complaints in its own airport Then another gentleman who happened to be from the airline staff probably thought he should also have a shot since i did not reply back to the illiterate and disrespectful women â One flight crew member we had was very rude Very poor service and food on our flights VERY HORRIBLE SERVICE some of the staff were chewing GUM horrid Being treated by their staff in such a poor way is unacceptable unless we are desperate we will never use Etihad again as their customer service is equally as poor I complained to cabbin staff say we paid for the extra space for us not others to que up for the toilets and seeking help for my foot to be offered NO first aid pain killers and was told is not our fault passangers need to wait there for the toilets Worst service ever We flew with Etihad from Australia to Rome and it was the worst flight ever Awful service lastminute com won t take responsibility and Etihad are pushing for us to get a refund Asked for a glass of water about 4 hours into flight and the cabin crew had to stop messing with their mobiles to get it me Flight attendants have poor customer service and bad attitude sick and the worker of airline dont want received tips Worst staff you can ever find worst food with no choice eat it or stayAsking for drinks takes ages for someone to respond to the call and again for them to bring it the staff are just run of their feet the whole flight The male air host for the flight was awfully rude to the passengers Awful service right from the get go Not once did we have cause to complain about the staff or the facilities The food and service were horrible Customer service is horrible the treat you like dirt Awful service limited leg space no food choices worst ever customer service Probably management wants to maximise profits so theyâ re resorting to silly tactics It has the worst customer service ever This was literally the worst flight I have ever had the misfortune to take Etihad airlines started out as a premium full service carrier however it seems as if years of bad financial results have forced them to cut back onboard service to the bone We would never ever go near this airline again and in our view they rank as the worst airline we have ever flown with Very poor customer service but cabin spaceIn 2018 planes are grotty look dirty and the staff just donâ t care Horrible service We went to customer service which was a total waste of time Absolutely appalling service from check in I called them almost 2 times to buy some articles from the Duty free Items but no crew member bothered to get them I am appalled by Etihad s poor customer service The female cabin crew was extremely rude I flew with them regardless and the customer service inside the plane was horrendousOn my flight to Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad the air conditioning was pathetic This airways has a poor customer service with all the hidden charges to penalize you for flying there airlines Harassment of travellers in Abu Dhabi behaviour of the Immgration officials were very high handed service quality food quality were very bad in the plane Food horrific staff unresponsive to passengers needs I did mention this to Etihad to no avail Worst flight ever time to reshuffle staff work on customer service rather thanWe find this really poor service made even worse by the fact that when we have tried to ask for assistance or a sympathetic ear we have been ignored Was travelling with the family to Phuket this was most probably the worst flight i have ever been on Even though I web checked in the etihad airline staff refused to give boarding pass as they overbooked their flight apparebrly for Barcelona and made us to stay at the airport itself for more than 8 hours by stating false statement that they will arrange for us lounge service as the next flight will be in the morning Instead they justified their lack of communication and service They ran out of non veg food the crew handling our section was extremely rude and mocked a fellow passenger and i must say this is the worse airline i have ever flown with including low cost Our whole holiday was ruined due to unprofessionalism of Ethiad ground and cabin staff Also tried calling customer care numbers but of no use Must say worst service in middle east airlines really disappointed The food options are very poor and flight crew are rude Bad service and bad call center Absolutely disgusted with Etihads support and services for an incorrect flight and then lack of communication or compromise V poor customer service It is a complete bad Service in Food Drink behavior of crew and each and everything Never did I think that I would be sweating in a plane flying 30000 feet up in the air for 4 5 hours till they turned off the heat I guess Cabin crew at the doors was rude and impolite An evening meal was served probably the worst food I have ever had on a long haul flight As if Etihad had 10 staff standing near the belt we found NO ONE in cairo Till date 30 03 2019 I am still waiting for the claim even after sending numerous reminders to the concerned baggage Claim Officer and feedback on Etihad website which has left me very frustrated The flight attendant was a bit rude and not very friendly but they refused to open the staff cubicle to help alleviate the delays I have to say I encountered by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life on EtihadPrefer only men as crew members as from experience they are kinder and not so intimidating and rude Bathroom was not cleaned and also in the plane you see garbage under seats No one bothered to pick up garbage as other airline employee pick garbage if they see like emirates Their customer service is terrible and damaged baggage is not replaced I at this point got very angry short and a bit rude to the staff and informed them I will take legal action once returned homeLong waiting line at security check and staff is a bit rude but I was told by a somewhat rude call centre agent that that s just their policy The flights were ok but sincerely the wait in the flag airport of the company was very bad The ground staff just use this piece of paper to pacify unhappy passengers and like me there are many others I know of who have been fooled like this I have flew with many airlines and by far this is the worst airline i have ever flown with I was very disappointed with the catering services They ran out of ice half way through the flight and you can only get warm drinks Smell and maintenance of bathrooms were horrific Please ignore this worst airline The children screamed throughout the entire flight and were constantly kicking the back of my seat When asked to stop we get abuse from so called parents when staff intervene theyâ re ignored I will make sure everybody who I know know about your bad services and careless Flight was comfortable enough but found the service and quality of food shocking Very poor service crew are very rude except from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne crew was very helpful but apart from thisâ The flight was delayed by 20mins as the crew had to persuade the other passengers to move to make way for this family of 7 to be accommodated they have decent aircraft but staff and service is horrible the service in 380 not expected to be this horrible its shame to AIRBUS company service is horrible the food is blant without taste and appears to be have prepared more than 24 hours ago in toilet no moisturizers noâ Secondly a crew on the plane was yelling at other traveller which looked like a very bad customer service to me Irresponsible staff who took care of my parents baggage transfer at Abu Dhabi airport and that equals a hell of a lot of flights and flight hours There was just one person in the information desk trying to deal with the fallout bad planning or what This is one of the worst airlines in the middle eastThe food quality was poor and not a great personal service However the air stewardess was so rude and the interaction so awkward that I felt compelled on this occasion because she really ruined my flight The cabin crews are very rude Food selections were really bad and the staff were not good either i am very upset with your company for the service offer and for the ethic behavior you can not treat your guest in this wayThe staff member at the check in counter was rude This was the worst airline food by far Don t think they needed to moneygrab Â 60 and give poor customer service a really poor attitude in customer service standards Etihad is worst airline Horrible service and a untrustworthy back office team made this a horrendous ordeal and an airline i would not ever travel with again very disappointed to know when i called and asked the reserve the seats for my parents as they are travelling to US with disability request and no front rows seats can be reserved as its paid service now Falsely claiming to be a Guest oriented airline when they instead treat wrongly their Guests Through this disaster of flying through Belgrade will never fly Etihad again There are no warning signs floor markings about the extra space we paid for to others nor did staff warn me about the chance of this happening or care about the issue We reached a Rome and our flight was gone and the staff from Alitalia was soo rude and they would just give a flight ffor the next day The poor customer was asked to repack the bags and it is disappointing to note the disorganisation and poor customer service Etihad is once of the worst staff carrying at the airport The customer service replied to my complaint yet till the date of this review the blocked amount was not released despite a reminder Again will any of our family use this company I wish I had checked the reviews prior to booking a flight as their customer service is ridiculous IF you can manage to get a Team Leader to talk to you after numerous attempts via their website feedback you again just get someone parroting the template terms conds no one can think outside the box and basically they just couldn t give a dam The in flight entertainment was terrible both the screen very pixelated and small the headphone very fuzzy noise and the content itself We have never encountered such poor service It was an extremely bad example of customer service Old style interior very poor service legroom is horrible if you can choose the A380 instead of the 777 It was too bad experience and air hostes forced me and taken my cabin bag from meSomeone in the Etihad top management and customer complaint department have to rectify this egregious error The counter staff refused to upgrade me So dear Etihad your customer service is a discgrace and a joke The service had been getting worseThe aircraft was dirty the staff on board for the first leg of the trip weren t the nicest and food was horrible so there is no excuse for dumping your waste on the floor leaving it for the crew to clean up after you have you no shame and do you make this mess in your own homes So i m not saying about they became a bad airlines only saying what changes and how sorry i felt about it It is worst service experience ever THAT GUY WAS ALSO TOO RUDE TO LISTEN TO ME and booked a flight scheduled AFTER 3 DAYSagain on my return same issue upon trying to understand the issue air hostesses behaviour wasn t positive understanding She just did not have basic curtesy of addressing people leave alone customers In short we are very disappointed and will never fly Etihad again as we will only associate it with that staff member who lies to your face The worst part of this experience was the lack of respect when I complained I had no response after writing three timeshonestly I am very disappointed on the level of service and customer care that we get from you what deemed themselves to be one of the best airlines world ð To start with about 3 hours into the flight you realise how uncomfortable the seats are and how poor the service is One staff accidentally hit my head with his shoulder while he was serving the food and he did not even acknowledge that Definitely the worst airline I have ever been on Next up they overbooked the final leg of our flight by over 20 people and point blank refused to let us on We can honestly say and we travel long haul a lot that this is the worse airline that we have ever used The B777 was also not a newish plane and the service was poor Worst operator ever racist impatient and unhelpful operator worst airline ever been on flights were delayed lost luggage no compensation just wasting my time with emails if you hate someone book them on etihadSo if you don t want to deal with airline staff lying to your face DO NOT FLY ETIHAD especially if you have young babies as they simply believe that you could play with them for 14 hours on an overnight long haul flight I had a horrible experience with the staff at Eithad Airways in Abu Dhabi airport The worst thing for me was the rudeness of the women crew but the standard of service on my opinion was poor We flew return with Etihad to Italy in September 2018 and although the service was acceptable there really wasn t anything outstanding Service is extremely poor and flight enjoyment and relaxation does not exist On the return from Abu Dhabi to Manchester the early morning flight was less than half full with plenty of empty rows which a few fellow passengers made the best of and enjoyed laying flat out and sleeping for 7 hours I would not travel with Etihad airways because of its very poor customer service Appalling services I m sorry to tell you that this is the worst airlines and customer service i have ever used such a shameCostumer service representative rude and not giving accurate information and with i dont care attitude with etihad never ever again Unfriendly crew member whose English is not clear Internet paid only no free allowance after half of the flight to jfk it basically stopped working Old dirty fleet It was extremely frustrating and quite surprising that an airline of this caliber cannot operate a hotline Water offered was limited seemed to be more push for passengers to get up and serve themselves water in the galley where several staff stood doing exactly nothing Very disappointed with Etihad especially the leg from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi poor service poor food Among the other stranded passengers are mothers with infants who don t have milk diapers or change of clothes for their kids and what is infuriating is the attitude of the staff which has progressively become worse with each passing hour Will Ethiad be responsible for not providing the service that they were supposed to Really bad experience flying with this airlineEtihad airlines provides HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Worst service i have ever experienced I almost fainted because of the stress having been in front of the service desk for more than 2 hours The food was not at all good and the toilets smelt at the start of the flight Then a 14 hours flights with a poor choice of films and a very bad quality of seat I asked the staff if they were aware as this was beyond a normal coughThe meals were so bad during the flight which is 9 hours and half flight and they used to provide 2 mealsâ The staff were embarrassed later order steak sandwich from snacks and you guessed it I took several flights with this company and each time the hostesses looked like in a bad mood and hateful Had to leave my cabin bag in the Maldives to avoid being charged again on my flight home Donâ t expect much as youâ ll be disappointed with the service and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the ground staff To add insult to injury I was then struck with the service trolley not once but twice Do think Etihad is a good airline offering a high standard of travel but as a lot of airlines allow passengers to recline their seats which I find annoying and shows a lack of respect for fellow passengers However from Abu Dhabi to Manchester terrible service no breakfast left and what they had left wasYour ground staff was worst rude zero knowledge about airline passenger baggage br Worst customer service experience In hindsight It is clear we were being messed around from the start by the staff in thailandthe recalled the flight but only me but other women was taken off the flight saying we boarded the wrong flight and the flightLeft house at 5am to be in a car for 2 hours only to get to airport and rude staff saying sorry flight over bookedThe staff were unhelpful and unresponsive to people in economy Flying as often as we have this is the worst flight weâ ve ever experienced New planes sound good but an airline built on poor service and weak integrity will never be able to raise above being just plain mediocre and I felt embarrassed the whole flight home The attitude of the flight attendants were worst of I have ever seen Then two flight attendants pull out a couple of massive bags of blankets on the left side of the plane only and start to give them out and people are literally fighting and climbing over each other to get one The Etihad Airbus A380 is simply an excuse to ram as many people on board as possible to maximise profit as such the service is poor flight attendants are rude and it it no more comfortable and Han a sardine can all in all a very disappointing experience that will not be repeated Their Customer Service team will deny this and respond by hiding behind their seating â policyâ Poor service at check in The chief ground staff lady was incredibly unhelpful and did not doâ Canâ t complain about the inflight service Very disappointing service average food and very very bad airline crew Worst Airline every First they lost my luggage i got it back after 1 month later i made a claim for delayed baggage and they never respond to my email The service from them was poor Passengers are waiting but management seems lost Flew on Etihad after a few years and the service has gone bad drastically Bad operational organizing After getting our luggages we were shoved out of the airport coz of an emergency Now and I donâ t blame the flight crew for this a flight beyond 6 hours should include at least one proper meal and a snack thatâ s more substantial than crackers couple of cookies Hope the airlines losses its business for its poor customer service if you get one of the dreamliner planes but the older stuff they use for the Manchester AUH flights are really dated and frankly poor planes with minimal leg room and dated entertainment packages Staff were stressed and not very friendly food was horrible and served in hurry it was more like throwing food to passengers not proper servingDuring bag drop we waited for almost 45 minutes in family area and the staff when i ask for supervisor help just lied that they didn t keep us waiting EtihadAirways the worst airlines ever experienced But since it was not offered I didnâ t feel like asking and upsetting the well worked management decrees Highly disappointed to the point the ground staff had me in tears travelling with an infant n being pregnant at the same time The service was absolutely dreadful The airport staff at Zurich had the audacity to snatch the hand baggage which was as per the airlines weight and dimension specs from my 15 year old daughter and forcing her to check it in The flight was delayed beyond 36 hours and the minuscule staff present at the airport totally failed to give any information to the harrowed passengers The food surely on a long haul flight totalling 20 hours there are more options than chicken fake mash potato veges The service was bad going and coning Lazy Flight attendants ignored my repeated requests of plain water to refill water into my bottle lied gave some patronizing answers Compared to other airlines it is cheaper but service was poor and the food selections mediocre Secondly They now keep exit seats free for the whole flight unless these are paid for it s all about money thier customer service is the worst Poor food and very bad check in as it seemed that the staff were only looking to loot the customers Service is so bad you should abstain from drinks and food This is terrible customer experience Have had good flights in the past but our recent experience with poor service and food will make us look for other airlines in the future Travelled with elderly mother in Aug 2018 and i pressed the button for service 3 times and 3 times was ignored yetThis is outrageous or a cleaver business model to charge for fixing a failed part of service Nicely configured business class but service was poor Was disappointed with the on board service or lack of it and the food quality was dreadful Abu Dhabi Airport is really poor compared to nearby Dubai long queues to get through security poor signage as to where flights leave from etc I flew on Saturday 4th August easy check in with Etihad but Manchester Airport Security check was a joke with the staff rowing with each other and were removed by their manager Some of the First Class passengers were quite rightly seething with rage at all the inconvenience and poor service they had experienced When you call for service you just get ignored and the food is not at the standard of other airlines economic classBad experience started in Manchester when staff decided the queue was blocking Emirates check in so proceeded to herd passengers behind us and moved them in front The service we have had is absolutely appalling It is a very long flight and seems to be worse in Economy Class The staff were also completely rude on the outward flight service with a smile was not something they were clearly aware of Pressed â helpâ button 5 times and became increasingly more furious when staff simply turned it off each time and walked off before finally saying to me â turnI am beginning to fight to try and get a refund for our missed flight home the check in staff who were very rude has lost our bag during the check in process and her supervisor assured us that they will find it and will send it with our flightThe in flight service was extremely poor Crew was rude and not friendly and they were very dry answering question that if any choice of food available This is worst flying experience i ever had with Ethiad We decided enough was enough and sent an email to the CEO of Etihad Mr Tony Douglas to make him aware of the bad service we were receiving by those representing the company to date we have had no reply wifi poor service poor To say I was disappointed with the service is an understatement Canâ t blame the flight attendants too much though as most travellers in economy tend to forget to bring their manners the stop over at Abu Dhabi was no problem before catching the flight to Male again serviceThe rude customer service told that the bus service going to Dubai is only complimentary Their customer service is worse than a government department So far itâ s been a really poor check in service i had the rest i had to go get my self as staff just ignored the call bell The crew member gave a condescending retort and wanted the last word when she delivered the waste bags still told us not to treat people like that not sure what to say and I think from my opinion that Etihad Airways become much worst and sheap in term of the quality of service from all other airlines The staff on Etihad flights are miserable rude and arrogant Poor leg room unresponsive touch screen entertainment and most importantly rude staff Worst flight we had No alternatives due to lack of food they almost pushed me to choose only one dish and this was from crew dish and during the long flight no breakfast selection The first leg of the journey from London to Abu Dhabi was on a larger aircraft but still the customer service and food on offer was very poor Only one meal during 14 hours and in order to get something to drink it took around 20 minutes minimum due to the lack of staff The service once the usual part had been done was poor twice called for service and was ignored Each flight was staffed with miserable surely crew who couldn t be bothered raising a smile at all when i tried to complain at the airline they tried to blame the passenger instead of investigate their staff behaviorThis was the worst airlines to travel with Worst Airline in the World I was pretty shocked about the inflight service which was pared down to the extent that you have the feeling you are flying a budget carrier It was a super nice flight except a ground crew was super rude to me The staff on the plane had no idea what I was talking about Pathetic old aircrafts flying in and out of india and not even a patch on emirates truly disappointed by the food and service on board and was forced to carry my own food onboard on my way back as the size of meals was microscopic and inedible looks like they have no money left as they start selling food immediately after the first service to make an extra buck Worst airlines I have ever traveled in the worst and rude staff I went with this airline on 16th of June to Irelandbecause it is a long flight to be sitting next to a complete stranger We had terrible customer service experience from Etihat Airways flying from Toronto to Abudhabi and our final destination was Kathmandu Nepal Things have improved but for nearly three years in a row Etihad s administration kept on messing up my air points and forgetting my Asian vegetarian meal requests No breakfast and service extremely slow When we got to the plane door he told the crew members and ground staff the first of a number of lies Never had a bad flight with Etihad Customer service is a joke Quite disappointed with the quality of food and service on Etihad This flight company practice is truely disgustingThe staff are unfriendly and miserable probably because of the constant complaints from passengers during the overnight flight we hardly saw them The airline staff sprinkled some powder on the vomit smeared it around and then spayed some perfume from the duty free onto it Worst airline flight was meant to leave at 2 05pmFound the level of on board service to be poor The entertainment system failed after 20 mins and we were forced to use our iPads or nothing if you didnâ t have one We had a lot of turbulences but this isnâ t the fault of the Airline Very poor and inattentive service I asked was handed a nearly empty bag of nibbles customer serviceAppalling customer care nobody replies Iâ m accustomed to 5 star service hence Etihad fails to impress Where I draw the line is to be provided with crappy flight service and poor customer service Late departure time but the plane ran on time slept most of the flight time except for meal times which were served promptly Extremely long queues at check in because of slow moving Etihad staff long queues at security due to Manchester Airport Furthermore service was poor little food was served and not enough water provided and it probably delayed the boarding of the plane I took the initial flight as possibly one bad flight however all 4 with Etihad were very poor I used to believe that national carriers are worst in service but Etihad has successfully managed to beat all other airlines in terms bof worst service I ve had better and worse flights so pretty neutral hereThis is just poor management This must be the worse customer attitude i have ever come acrossOnce on the plane the staff were very unfriendly and really quite miserable The ground staff was speaking to me if it was my fault for giving them the business Flew on the A380 which was excellent even though apparently going out of service They should outsource the customer service for luggage in Italy as the service in Milan is terrible NOBODY KNOWS NOTHING is just ridiculous when you pay a ticket of 6 000 Euros with Qatar when my luggage was delayBut the worst came on the flight homePoor quality airline Not only was the airport experience an absolute joke but the staff ground crew and flight service were a disgrace When I complained that tis was a bit vexing at worse and why didn t the crew on the flight advise best place to goAfter telling us those stupid reasons he continued servicing other passengers and ignoring us and they remained empty the whole flight 11 days later I got a response that Mr M L is not able to assign the seats asked me to contact service centre As a last comment I must say some people are an absolute disgrace with the mess they leave behind them food thrown on the floor and all sorts of rubbish just left on the floor and seats crew come round frequently with a bin to collect rubbishI had 3 young children sat in the seats in front of me one of whom screamed for at least an hour of the flight I m not sure if its only my bad luck or the service level has actually declined this is my second flight this month with Etihad Airways and the fourth this year but overtimeThe first warning I d give any Etihad passenger flying Business from Heathrow is to say how VERY disappointing and poor their Business Class Lounge is too bad is the only company flying directly to Rome Worst of all when the crew were instructed to take their seats the male crew member opposite us starting reciting the Koran they wouldnt move us even after many requests and it was the worst flight I ever had big shout out to the girl in the middle seat who really was ok with my boy the whole 15 hour flight There was an obvious difference between the Qantas operated aircraft and Etihad one firstly when it is meal time the Qantas staff insist that all the seats are upright the dreamliner boasts more leg roomThe staff in Turkey was especially unhelpful when they refused to check in our large group of 12 people onto our flight from Turkey to Abu Dhabi for arriving right at the cutoff time of 1 hour before take off We had given our account details of 2 different banks alongwith the SWIFT code to your staff but your staff said that it was rejected In general planes need a revamp old seats entertainment half the time hand controls are slow or unresponsive seats flat and hard My only slight moan was the service and food The absence of any communication made things worse Food was terrible service was bad I suspect Etihad s customer service department is going to have a shed load of complaints demands for compensation The most horrendous experience was the interaction with the staff in the Abu Dhabi airport I dont understand why is this day of age with so much airline competition and Etihad constantly devaluing their brand how you can treat customers so badly My son called them from Vienna and the customer service adviser for no rationale reason terminated the call I chose Etihad as they were the only airline that would guarantee me a lie flat bed on each flight The nearly 200 per person for the 3 hour leg got us frozen appetizers rubber chicken and very very slow service as with first leg For a full care airline the service was poor None of them looked like they wanted to be there nobody smiled the service seemed completely haphazard and the food was bland and barely lukewarm Flight ey244 lahore to abu dhabi very poor service delayed by 2 hours and no led behind seats Seat pitch was I d guess 31 staff appeared disinterested and certainly couldn t be bothered to check the state of the toilets which were pretty grim by the time we reached Amsterdam Customer service was poor Checkin staff at AUH and DEL very slow and unwelcomingEtihad is an extremely frustrating experience as customer care will tell you that they do not know and have sent query but never come back with answer Etihad charged me 3150 AED for a 45min flight after being mislead by customer service after my flight was late getting in Why does Etihad think they are entitled to take money from customers but fail to deliver the service paid for The food was very disappointing service offered was minimal If this was just a single individual we would not comment but the entire crew had a bad attitude We will not be traveling on this bad airline anymore The level of service in business class on this flight was disappointing a new plane tight seats unfriendly crew I asked for a special meal in advance but due to an internal error they did not know about and the crew just simply ignored me not even tried to solve the problem or serve something to my family If you want to avoid hassles and be sure you deal with a professional company spend your money with any other airline is my advice as if you read reviews on them as i wosh14 1 2 hours flying in a confined space with bad service where were the flight attendants only twice water supplied and yucky toilets not even looked at by staff I have to admit that the service was worst than any third world countries airlines Held up for 4hours plus on connection flight inspite of sitting on plane for this timeEven the flight take off was delayed almost 1hr from 9 30pm The 10 15 am flight from Abu Dhabi to jfk in flight service has been terrible On the way back Oman to Abu Dhabi then Abu Dhabi to Manchester the worst flight ever on the last leg and the girl form from staff is talking very rudely with me and literally miss behaving with customer Well documented deep cost cutting on the off board experience such as cutting chauffeur services and secondâ I am sure you are well aware that this is not the best way to handle customer complaints that were totally created by your staff members in the first place More as value of money I consider expensive for the services we got and fof seatschildren in groups for fun competitions and gamesâ etc In flight purchases of drinks and snacks were ignored for 2 hours the ground crew was horrible first of all they had around 5 check in counters and only 3 were working Probably the worst long haul flight l have ever been on the seats were cramped and the service in economy sadly lacking More scary was you could clearly see the rivets on the wing and engine were split but crew do not pay attention and the worst of all apart from no oxygen was we were in turbulence for over 180 minutes of the flight and passengers where holding on for dear life I am absolutely shocked of the appalling customer service my partner received on a long flight from Melbourne Australia to Amsterdam Food was appalling service was virtually non existentwhere near the alleged 32 inch leg room the food was dire the service was poor and all in alli really disappointed about your service A variety of food is available although services can get a bit slow the ground service were ok except for the boarding at the gates they were very slow and didnt giveâ Ahmedavad airport staff gave me more headache at the boarding time still she persisted and got me a seat anyhow by bumping a staff member to the next flight Second because of the major delays due to the computer errors at IAD we arrived at AUH with barely any time before our flight to MNL left and no direction from staff about where we should be heading which was particularly troublesome because we were not given boarding passes for our AUH to MNL flight therefore we did not know the gate number Then she continued to serve the woman in front wine who drank non stop the whole flight It just seemed to be to much trouble for the crew and the midnight snack of a roll that was very dry with filling you couldn t find was practically throw at you Iâ m really upset to have lost my item but even more upset to know that itâ s probably sitting with Etihad whom donâ t seem to care about customer care Be careful Etihad has some pretty awful code share airlines I asked him to keep some bottles of milk in the fridge for me at the start of the flight I think the plane was just to big with too many people to be looked after by too few staff andNothing went horribly wrong during my flights but the service standard was just too low The service is quite bad instead of calling flight attendants many times I was not served any water Well it is really not rocket science to improve passenger experience and it doesn t even cost much it only takes a bit better forecast of when the peak check in days and times are it only takes to put a few more ground staff to channel and to talk to those wait in line and it only takes genuine smiles and friendliness from the staff and a few apologies to make passengers waiting in long lines feel better I did not expect etihad airways with low quality service We check in at 1045 for an 1115 flight they rush us through customs to fjnd out flight time is now 12 which is not going to happen as lots of people still left to check in Booked the tickets The webpage crashed and we had to call their service center because the reservation was done but the payment was in limbo in the meanwhileThis miserable excuse for an airline would go bankrupt in 1 month if they didnâ t have a near monopoly on service out of Abu Dhabi They gave me the morning flight instead which means 12 hours less in Manchester Poor experience travelling with a family so reported it to customer services and they are even worse The flight home from Rome was worse as we could not pre checkWhich brings me to the worst part of the flight Hard to get your prefered seat the seats always block by the ground staff the first class lounge at Abu Dhabi is quiet good The ratio of staff per economy section is a little low Meals where probably as good as any in economy but the snack was not great at all and although plane was not at all full the service seemed slow and also there was no separate drink services you had to ask for drinks soft drinks in our case which was a bit of a shame Between travelling economy and business class Etihad has really lowered their standards and their snobby staff make flyingâ All other aspects of the service and fight were as youâ d expect in business class Now they charge you for preassigned seat for any checked in luggage and their inflight service is extremely poor We are shocked and extremely disappointed with the airline s approach 80 when I asked to change the place of the sick patient whose seat was somewhere elseWe managed to make it to our gate despite no guidance and we were treated by the staff at the gate as if it was our fault we were running late Food awful back to the bad old days of airline food It is a horrible customer service with such International Airlines The sad thing is that the staff said it should take 10 15 minTheir call centre is imcompetent spoke to at least 8 staff members kept on hold for hoursThey must be losing so much money to force such basic inflight standards and service Taking that into account I still feel the general service was less than it should have been But this time I was shocked to see the lack of professionalism and decline of service quality Service was as expected whilst the food was typical airline food Worst ever i had experience in my entire 10 years of flight travelThis was my first time flying with Etihad and it has been such a horrible experience Service was heps better had water and a wet towellet provided before flight However what really disappointed me was the service on all 4 flights The male staff Food Beverage Managers Etihad Airways is rude and force us to choose the menu This is unfortunate as we had used this service several times before The in flight service is very poor He was on this call from the time he sat down until the plane was already on air For some reason the air conditioning on the plane was very poor and it must ve been about 30C in the cabin We specifically asked if the food contained nuts in which we were told by the air hostess they not sure For such a big organisation their customer service is absolutely atrocious Plane entertainment system only activated an hour and a half after flying Tried calling them no customer care for damaged baggage claims The whole thing took some 25 minutes with an upset wife upset daughter and unhelpful ground staff who had options up his sleeve but deliberately lied and delivered zero customer service It s sure the price of Etihad Airways which is much expensive than Air Astana but Etihad Airways has nothing better Disappointed with the whole customer service experience onboard staff were rude food was terrible and we were offered a cup of water 5 times during our 14 hour flight I even slept almost the entire flight which almost never happens in a short flight The service was very poor on this sector As long haul flights go this is the worst I have ever been on On the first leg the flight attendant seemed to forget about it and for the second leg from AUH to CAI I was told that there was none Woman on check in bag drop at Heathrow needs to up her customer service she was a real misery applying makeup at the counter just before you start work is totally unprofessional Sadly I cannot recommend this flight as Etihad decided stop the service to Jaipur from 2018 onwards By the end of the flight staff had assisted so much the racially and religious terrorising hatred plane were all joining in Wifi was the only facility missing in the plane which was for roughly 8and half hours The staff in the checking counter couldnâ t figure out what to do they wanted us to pay 100 By the time we agreed instead of loosing so much time their manager yelled at us over the phone that she needs at least an hour to change the name and we wonâ t make it to the flight so I had to call for assistance each time and surprisingly the staff would immediately pinpoint the issue and move my seat Service on 14 hr is horror â In flight entertainment was most disappointing so little to choose from so disgusting knowing it wasn t a full flight they have given us any choices the crews where not even apologetic service take it or leave attitude couldn t care less the central did not let them to reissue did they even listened to what happened at the airport I called customer service several times just to be told I have to pay the change plus the NO SHOW fee again SHAMELESS 500 euros I been flying 6 times a year for the past 5 years all with different airlines and this by far been the worst Was most disappointed with the service both times After about 80 mins a staff member comes down the line and says their check in system is down and asked us to be patient Etihad has a project currently goin on to increase the seats in each flight which is the reason for the new seats very less leg space exactly like a budget airline and poor seating experience Seats are normal Business Class standard with lie flat option Customer service is appalling unimpressive underwhelming disappointing Total shock after flying with so many U S based carriers where service has been deleted from their vocabulary poor girls been running like a headless chicken when i asked the crew why i have to wait for so long myâ The trouble started at T2 in Mumbai itself as the staff of the Airline came very late to issue boarding passes Very poor in flight service they ran out of meal selections during every meal Again for the most part the flight crew were really friendly and accommodating however some of the hostesses on this flight showed a level of unprofessionalism when dealing with a difficult customer to which one hostess exclaimed to most of the passengers how annoying this passenger was Then the food was the worst we have experienced on a long haul flight Poor entertainment facilities I really needed water to take my pills for a lot of problems they fix for various medical conditions including epilepsy and the horrible seizures but only the male crew member showed courtesy and said i needed to sit for a few minutes only Called customer service last August for my elderly parents who were trying to keep their air miles Service is atrocious and simply unacceptable I traveled a 24 hour long flight from India to Sweden and after I managed to avoid to get food posioned my whole time in India I can now ironicly state that when I came home after this long trip I have suffered from food posioning Needless to say I was moved to a later cheaper and utterly horrid flight time the day after my booked and paid for seat We got in to AbuDabi slightly late and by the time we d disembarked and bused to the terminal again we were already 30 minutes late for boarding our next flight Worst experience of our life In this case I believe the website was quite misleading for saying 48 hours before my FLIGHT instead of saying before ANY service which in this case was the coach ride The flight started 30 minutes delayed from Abu Dhabi and as a result arrived behind the scheduled at Toronto Airport I am usually miserable after a very long flight Needless to say this is the worst aircraft customer service I have ever seen Cant fault the airline for anything except for the in flight entertainment being a bit boring Food was excellent and some good movies to watch to pass the time although none of the flights seemed to be too long or boring which is a compliment to the airline Expressing my bitter experience with the Etihad baggage mishandling and WORST customer support experience My fellow passenger asked to be served breakfast 1 hour before landing already a stretch I thought but the flight attendant didn t come until 30 minutes before landing so she had to decline the mealLike all airlines Etihad airways had to save money since a couple of years due to wrong management of course the service on board was not improving I waited 2 weeks before writing a review just to see if I was still feeling disappointed with the lack of service and poor quality food Soon after that another flight attendant placed a bottle of water on my table and walked away Etihad are by far the worst airline I have used in terms of Customer Service The temperature in the cabin was so hot that all the passengers were sweating and uncomfortable but the staff were unable to do anything I am really disappointed with the services of this Airlines and thought of being vocal about thisIt is also a big reality that such type of experiences only happened when you depart from third world countries like Pakistan because the same airline when travel to Europe and USA have a very different way of conduct services which is patheticWaste of time reserving seats and ordering children s meals The service was slow and staff seemed disinterested and tired My partner has now gone onto book a flight with an entirely different airline because of some body elses mistake and i did not got even the half of the service that i get in emirates economy what to talk of business Thus one is obliged to sit in oneâ s seat for nearly the entire 13 hr flight The bosses of the racist passengers should place their staff under investigation for violations of human rights and living in the mind set of the 70â s There should also be a review and maintenance of first class cabins as some pieces are damaged and broken Asians Australians are treated at a poorer level of service and attentionâ My first experience with Etihad and definitely my last one having flown with countless airlines I have never ever experienced such a bad client service and support Even better didnâ t get the 100 USD and upset 2 loyal Platinum members on their 20th wedding anniversary whose loyalty to this airline with rapidly declining service standards is now severely strained but I guess just tired from the long flight A staff member appeared a few hours later and told some of the passengers that there was a plane leaving in 45 minutes that we could get onand we were treated badly as if we were the bad ones while we were without a doubt the victims of a terrible malfunction of some technical planning or system Take off was bit delayed due to anti icing and air traffic Ethidad customer services are ignoring my communications re delays missed transfers being stuck at our Geneva destination due to a 4 hour delay in Abu Dhabi causing a 2 hour stay in Geneva Airport Drinking water service a little less both the ways the staff is so dumb that they couldn t give the seats in sequence to families Hard to understand they re used to be an excellent airline to fly to Southeast Asia but with our recent trip I m kind of shock with the service offering onboard I fly frequently on this route with the same airways but it s services are not the same every time very less leg space if the neighboring seat is emptyThe cabin crew work overtime to try and make you forget that the plane needs to be retired or hauled in for a MAJOR overhaul My husband and I are both business class frequent flyers and we encountered the worst ever experience on this particular flightHowever this first flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was quite disappointing In the boarding area at gate 32 suddenly an etihad staff starts shouting rudely Maybe their cheaper prices compared to their competitors justifies for this level of service The inflight service was poor and the staffs are not even informing us that we can queue somewhere else cozOne drawback with Etihad they don t offer a menue not even online i e you don t even know what you choose if the crew comes with their typical chicken or lamb Really poor experience lost luggage terrible food dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper on all flights and a reluctance from the crew to fill up my water bottle after being advised that I could not take a full water bottle on in Abu Dhabi and there being no water facilities in the departure lounge I requested the flight steward if I can move into any one of the seats because I was feeling quite sick Given the very tired state of the aircraft the lousy picture quality of the entertainment screens sound and the fact that you can t control the temperature at your seat this airline is totally outclassed by the other UAE carriers I have flown with recently i felt like there is no more humanity or customer service left Worst is like their miserable partner airline American they wonâ t transfer a bag to Delta meaning you have to claim your bag recheck it with Delta and go through security again i am struggling to get a complaint escalated have been sending emails for the last month or so and to date there has been no satisfaction and I am stuck with the same person who seems to have no sense of customer service or consideration Its business class we paid alot to get the seats and the service was very bad The flight attendants continually forgot to bring food and drink orders never made an effort to follow up and left meal trays on our tray tables for hours before picking them up Forget the on board experience and service simply receiving the etihadguest miles is a battle Tired aircraftThe business class product is actually really good as in the seat and hardware unfortunately it s the service that really needs an overhaul BUT all let down by grumpy cabin crew Etihad were very comparable in the price of their flights at this time but disappointed with the service and lack of Water or juice provided I ended up in hospital with a blood clot what caused my mothers passing as well after the flight back the staff asked for a copy of my medical notes and my mothers death certificate so they would partially refund us for the experience and distarous trip Service on the ground is ridiculously bad and on the flight very ordinary By the way AUH MXP the staff looked inexperienced and was quite unfriendly The headphones collected about 20 minutes before landing and entertainment system stopped 5 mins after was too early as even after landing as passengers were on the plane 10 mins They are the worst airlines ever wish I took pictures to upload first when I weighed my bagggagePoor inflight service tooa window seat and window glass was super dirty entertainment system is not available for almost half of the flight duration Probably some of the poorest quality Airline food I have had in a long time Passengers equally unruly to make it more difficult for the cabin crew who behave as if they are managing a plane load of prisoners The in flight service was dreadful Flight from London Heathrow to Abi Dhabi best flight ever been on shocked plane was more less empty so was aloud to have three seats to myselfI never want to fly with them again and now have a non transferable voucher for their services that they think is compensation when really it just means more money spent on Etihad Staff seemed staff strangely familiar with this problem In addition if you have to transit through Abu Dhabi it has to be one of the worst airports in the world to spend any time in The crew lacked the professionalism and finesse of Qatar Airways and Emirates as clearly did the overall product She was genuinely appalling and one of the rudest people I ve come across in my life not when you need when you re sick on a long haul flight and then the cabin crew ignored our call button when we tried to get a replacement When I asked if the flight is delayed the staff said no when in fact the history of this flight is 90 delayed We were delayed on the plane in Dublin after boarding and the air hostess handed out water and juice while we waited for air traffic control to give clearance I was disappointed to find that the standards of this airline had definitely dropped Once boarded the plane there was one female cabin staff who seemed to rushing around and had a nervous expression on her face which told me she was probably new and a male member of the cabin crew who walked toward her yawning complaining he was tired they then continued to discuss there private lives not professional Having to pay to pick seats isnâ t typical of a flag carrier itâ s a trait of a struggling airline or budget airline sure what to expect as I had read some bad reports of this particular airline but we couldnâ t have had a more enjoyable flight I have checked a number of blogs and it seems that Etihad is renowned for their poor customer service It was also the 3rd time there was some sort of problem with the flight and the second very poor error resulting directly from management I explained the situation that we were going to the business lounge the staff agreed they would take him in the chair and I wish that the senior flight attendants who become microphone hogs would get over themselves as the excessive number of in flight announcements in two languages for often really trivial things which result in interruption of sleep and in flight entertainment whilst they waffle on is a real painThatâ s after you waited 30 minutes plus to even get a flight attendant Iâ ve complained online and via the phone 4 times and have been offered a 100 dollar discount on the next flight BUt the quality of the plane from Dublin to Abu Dhabi was shocking it starts as soon as you enter the aircraft flight attendants are long faced and miserable as thought they are doing you favourâ This seems to me to be a new form of highway robbery that they can get away with not providing a service and still charge the full fare we are nearly 12 000 out of pocket as a result I had an extremely poor experience with Etihad I have written to Etihad about this for the first time ever because the level of customer service was so bad Slow attendants 2 hours to clear a away a meal tray when we were asking how to proceed with lost and found from the transfer desk staff she was answering her personal mobile phone in the middle without anyâ AbuDhabi the check in counter personnel were busy playing a game on their cellphone totally nonchalant that there were passengers waiting to check in the worst part is that they were incapable to check us all the way to Queenstown and instead of investigating the cause they just issued us the boarding passes to AbuDhabi and told us that the rest of the boarding passes will be issued to us upon arrival to AbuDhabi by the transit counter But their in flight customer service is very poor you get whatever with a who cares attitude the staff with the trolley crashed into many people in the isle as their drinks holder hang out over the width of the trolley You will not pay anything and indeed we got the leg room for the rest of the flight They raised their voices and were extremely demanding and the crew just gave in to them by 1 00am in the morning the plane was declared grounded and off we got the ground staff where confused and did not really deal with this situation I doubt if I would ever recommend this to anyone unless you improve your service rather than self proclaiming yourself as No 1 Airline of the world It is VERY expensive and not part of your mobile plan Flying back yesterday frim delhi via abu dhabi first flight was delayed an hour but I still made the connection which was only 30 mins instead of 75 and they still landed in london on time with my transferred bag I think that Etihad are dropping the the ball don t get me wrong the staff are greatIn times of Austerity itâ s a shame to see that the level of service Amenities have taken a hit and the experience is never as good as other locally based airlines for example the chauffeur service when arriving to destinations outside the UAE has gone as have the amenity kits Etihad in its quest to reduce costs has made in flight experience a painful experience Somehow they became very shameless on prices and service Anytime you can choose alternative even if it is almost impossible to come to Abu Dhabi without using this poor company I booked a business class ticket from Abu Dhabi to Rome business class with ETIHAD tend to be expensive but with the service they delivered it made it very expensive My companion sister fell ill during the first leg of our flight from South Africa to Amsterdam My impression of the cabin manager was that she had lost control and having gone through the Company line the passengers were not for giving upThe price is high the service is poor especially the ground support check in was slow in the extreme did organised and people got very fustrated save your money and go with a cheaper airline or go with Emeriates Etihad simply are a waste of moneyI complained to Etihad about this lack of service and after a very slow email exchange that lasted for months I was advised in early January of this year that my indemnification of USD 60 dollars would be paid into my account within 14 21 days Only pity was that our luggage couldn t catch up our next flight maybe transit timeHad a long hall flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi then on the Heathrow staff not friendly at all on both flights not welcoming or around much at all looked confused and when asked for water at their station just in a rush and just not as good as other airlines Iâ ll start with the good news in that Etihad airlines got us from Manchester to Singapore but it was the customer care and experience which were poor We were a little put out that we were spoken to by the staff rather rudely when waiting for a restroom I barely convinced the staff that I will miss my flight if I wait in the que and accepted to utilize the business class que The cabin staff should really be more aware of how many drinks are being served Overall Etihad like most big companies has lost its way with the routine of being a service As soon as we walked onto the plane it felt and looked outdated and even the staff uniforms Ground staff lazy and disorganised Personal ego got dragged to the point when Aida the lady manager and Vladimir asked us to give them the boarding pass to take our luggageâ s off the plane and make us forcibly miss the flight Buisness class was worse than any economy class I have ever used apart from comfortable seat inflight tv system not working lunch menu offered from 8am lights turned out as if night time flight from around 2 pm irish time Dear Customer Relations Officer at Etihad Airways So the whole flight took 25 hours which is way too long But this experience of ETIHAD STAFF made me cry aloud at the airport being felt so helpless I asked my wife to take a picture of air hostesse face and later I will put on hereAfter asking for a blanket 1 2 an hour after takeoff the flight attendant told me they didn t have any blankets which I thought was insane We had one flight with partially English staff and the difference was very obvious enough said My booking KQQYEL was cancelled due to cancellation of a connecting flight There was barely room to move let alone walk around especially on the very long haul flights The staff onboard are rude and really have poor communications skills and training After months of complaints and endless emails Etihad have offered to give us a credit knowing they will not be flying to Perth anymore they are not willing to compensate us for being out of pocket and have stopped relying to emails their customer service is appalling Fortunately the other girl from the cabin crew said that someone from the airport is waiting for us to take us to another flight because the airport is so huge and we couldn t made it alone in that short time for sure so they let us leave the plane before all passengers from the business class did We had a stop over at Abu dabi but the whole flight was without any problems flight attendant was very rood and impolite with here response and said exactly that she has nothing to do with the cockroaches or the money I paid for my seat pls set down military orders Food is bad range of beverages limited EY68 half front part of the plane is crazy warm Old aircraftsso I had to make my long flight extremely uncomfortable as I suffer from a Low Back Ache Astounded by this and the fact that major competitors were offering a free reroute delay in departure or a full refund he emailed a complaint to them receiving a very unhelpful response stating that Etihad take the safety of their customers very seriously But the technical support service is disgusting We had a return flight with 1 stop so 4 individual flights and on every single one were were sitting apart andI have formally raised a complaint on Etihad website with no answer from them I will initiate a legal case with US department of Transportation Since the past few years service is really going down on Etihad No reply to a formal complaint I made using a form at their website where you have to fill out every single minute detail of your flight which took half an hour Long flights become punishment when such things happen They seem to have taken cost cutting way too much and definitely sacrificing their service After dinner most tried to sleep but the incessant noise from the crew in the galley chatting away made any hope of sleep impossible Etihad does not offer service anymore I was dreading this long haul flight but Etihad were wonderful Because of the very uncomfortable seats and lack of any leg room I would think twice about flying with the airline all the staff seemed weary too The plane left a little late because of Air Traffic Control but we arrived in Melbourne right on time However I always ensure I eat at the airport prior to boarding to avoid having to rely on their food other airlines do have better food on board but often fail on overall service and punctuality you request one it will take a minimum of 45 minutes to serve one observed this when they were serving neighbouring seats even though it was their first request some staff seems to be struggling to get along with their own colleagues during the flight and not very happy to work together staffEtihad racist profiling Arrived late boarding gate E5 understand if the staff simply said sorry noWhat worse the coming home flight has rescheduled additional transits The food on our first flight 14 hours was abysmal but nothing prepared me for our connectingâ The in flight entertainment is a joke This happens frequently and the airport needs so remedial work to change this I have been emailing them for 3 months now trying to recover some costs that i lost due to their own staffs negligence but they will not take responsibility even though everyone else we spoke with on our trip that worked for the airlinesSomone later said these are paid seats which is fine albeit the seat remained empty for the whole flight As a customer I am extremely upset and embarrassed at what my mothers had to endure at one of the biggest airport of India as well as at the hands of one of the most reputed International airline services of the world Long flights in Economy are hard to endure not like years ago when it was a pleasure to fly On the return flight hubby had the bad seat experience touch screen not working properly seat didn t massage or recline fully etc The flight attendants looked very miserable did not see one smile from them the entire flight andâ Half the in flight entertainment wasn t working but there was no plane no staff and no announcement to say that the flight was delayed A pity as this airline used to be a real reference in terms of service But I was hugely disappointed with the cabin crew But after i recently took a flight to bangkok and returned to Manchester it seems there service has fallen way behind that of Emirates When we pulled the window screen up the air hostess said it would disturb other sleeping passengers The crew completely avoid answering call bells and have no care for passengers when pushing their carts down the aisles It will be a sad to see this airline pull out of WA I was completely drained of all energy by this time AirIndia staff said they have no obligation to full fill Etihad s mishap Lots of Arabic messages and prayers but poor English messages and the flight deck announcements were almost intelligibile 2 extremely long flights No attention was given to us and we were made to feel we were interupting if wanting service or anything from their miserable snack menu What is extremely disappointing is that there is no senior enough person who can assist with this or is contacted by ground staff who have very little autonomy to intervene even in genuine casesI can tolerate the poor food uncomfortable seats and poor inflight entertainment system They said they would send a staff member to our gate to talk to us in the next 10 minutes Courtesy toilet bag no good at all to help freshen up after such a long flight not even a comb It was not a full flight On our return journey from AUH to YYZ Flavia took care where as rest of the cabin crew were rude and uncaring The Rest of the flight was spent trying to get some rest Re my last reviews in May and June with promises and more promises that an imaginary customer relations officer will be in contact to resolve my complaintWe were told that the matter of our duty free would hopefully be sorted out before we left Sydney it wasn t I have been travelling at least twice a year on long haul flights since I was 12 years old which accumulated to over 20 years of travelToilets were not clean and overall service was very average Check in and gate staff were miserable and very unhelpful noâ The service and amenities have really suffered in two years As 4pm arrived in MNL we asked the staff member if we should go down to baggge claim We were flying form Ahmedabad to London and most of our baggage was damaged I send them a email with photos of our boarding pass along with a photos of our damaged bags I asked the flight attendant and the guy setting next to me if he paid any money he said that He did not pay anything My daughter was crying the whole flight Surely the flight attendant knew I was not served any food During the whole flight the In flight entertainment WiFi TV movies assigned to my seat Did Not work and they took almost 400 for no service This crew was ok nothing special which is disappointing I was unable to find an Etihad Representative in Amsterdam and ground staffsorry that was airport staff not an airline Staff on board the flight during service were not helpful in the slightest at any point Staff were dismissive both ways and very uncomfortable seats quite cramped for a 14 hour flight This was not the first time I have heard of Etihad s baggage issues 3 of my friends have had this on 3 separate occasions and though not necessarily the fault of the airline the consistent risk of missing baggage when flying with EtihadI would like to know why the lady who was a supervisor flight attender lied to me EY472 from AUH to CGK in 20 Sep 2018 Minimum 40mins with up to 2 hours sitting on the plane without entertainment because the entertainment doesnâ t start until after the plane is leveled in the air it was a small flight and quite cramped service was pretty slow but overall manageable now at Abudhabi we boarded the A380 to London and all exited but again service was not upto standard One of the flight attendants from JFK to Abu Dhabi spilled hot coffee on my hand and didn t even say sorry I hope the management will do something about these flaws as they will lose their customers and business in the future I thought but its empty and we are in air made no sense to me at all Flight attendants failed to give good service The airline is struggling so much that the crew is now asked by the company to check the exit flights specifically and to make sure no one sits in them unless they payOver the last 6 months I have tried 4 5 times to use spend my Expiring Guest Miles via ETIHAD s Phone Service portal to Book Business Class Redemption Flights on several ETIHAD Partner Airlines I informed the transfer desk people that was unacceptable as we had animals work and other matters waiting for us urgently back home Definitely will not be flying with this airline again all they care about is your money and not about the actual services they provide As I say I have been travelling with business for 25 years and this is my worst experience travelling I found the service almost non existent the food almost inedible and the staff did not seem to be engaged Flight is full and the service crew were obviously overwhelmed as they are unable to remember the requests For me the choice will always be governed by price and schedule and in this regard Etihad were ok BUT given the unpleasantness of the crew and the grubbiness of Abu Dabi I would steer away from using Etihad in future unless their pricepoint were significantly lower than others The airline staff conveniently completed their work hours and left leaving us passengers waiting indefinitely for the visas and hotel rooms Then a flight attendant is yelling to clear the aisle which was clear because we weren t allowed to stand up However we were left to wait at the customer service counter hoping to go After having condensation from the overhead locker totally wet my left side after a long flight from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi and to be told by flight attendant that they would move me but didn t and had to board another long flight from Abu Dhabi to London within an hour of landing with damp clothes was a very uncomfortable situation I have the sad experience of flying again on ETIHAD Airways the nations airlines but such a long way to catch up to Emirates Airways during our flight they ran out of snacks knowing it was a full flight of people they should have prepared for this I then asked for a refund of our flight back to LA as I would need to purchase another flight home on another airline When we landed in Hong Kong I tried to explain to the cabin crew that I have less than 30 minutes till next flight but she didn t want to listen and allow us to get off the plane because the passengers from the business class had the priority We left Brissy with virgin and because our flight was delayed they automatically cancelled our ongoing flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi in the middle of flight i hve noticed sumthing on my leg which is a big cockroach Staff not trained properly to deal with situations The cabin staff are drab with little in the way of personality The food quality served on the plan in economy class is not good and the staff service is normal Check in in Rome and other airports where we boarded was very slow due to lack of staff In my specific flight if you asked for something it seemed the flight attendants don t like to be asked Once settled in the plane I spoke with staff about my brothers dietary needs only to be told they had no log of this and had no gluten free meals on board wont fly after my return this time with you again total no respect for people on long haul flightService on board was pretty slow but food was tasty and drinks were offered Delayed boarding at Sydney airport with staff asking us if we were willing to fly the next night instead due to overbooked plane Pre booked childâ s meal missing and â not registeredâ on first two flights reported both times Around 5 staff members led by one boss openly fighting on the open floor with each other Child screaming nearby for 14 total hours all good with meAt every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff disgusting food poor service scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line In general But NOT for this flight yet happened on different flights as I traveled several times out of Abu Dhabi Airport to different destinations I hope whenever shuttle buses are used to take passengers from terminals to planes or vice versa NOT to overcrowd shuttle buses with passengers Especially Business Class Passengers as this affects the reputation of any airline Nothing of the sort was given during the 7 hours long flight There was no information at all and the unfortunate staff on the ground were in the dark Both flights were strictly on time the staff was friendly and kept busy particularly on the flight from heathrow Again female flight attendants were miserable and hard to find Having the whole day outside and on the day of our flight preparing got us exhausted The Cabin crew said that all water is locked up and it is not recommended to drink water off the tapsThis was my worst cabin crew experience I thought on the first flight the crew was just tiredThere no individual air vents above your headâ Washroom in the plane was always clean despite a full flight of over 12The cabin crew just sat at the back of the plane looking bored as they had nothing to do The staff donâ t seem to care The security staff in the airport were very messy when checking my things as it was the first time I had ever travelled business I just don t think I made the most of the service going through the airport never mind on the plane so this time I made sure I wasâ Truly the worst airline and experience that I have ever had in an airline Everything about it from check in to in air to ground staff was miserable Lazy Flight attendants denied me of water Etihad s service has deteriorated drastically over time cabin crew are rude and impolite and not willing to assist Flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi over 7 hrs flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne over 14 hrs staff not attentive despite only being 100 people on the first leg asked for a particular drink nothing special just a ginger ale to be told they only had one can for the entire flight Not the greatest of leg room or service delayed leaving Manchester so bit chaotic changing at Abu Dubai felt much like budget airlineIt is very unfortunate that this airline which used to provide a decent service has fallen very low My impression of this airline which was made after flights in two weeks on two aircraft type is disappointing This airline seriously needs to look at its customer service it has none The staff were unable to help I must say last time I felt that crew numbers had been cut I am posting this to make the public aware of how nonexistent the airline s customer service is in case you or any of your family members or friends decide to travel via Etihad and encounter problems in the near future until I had my foot stood on kicked around 20 to 30 times by passangers staff and a drinks trolly the female cabin crew member began giving out scented face wipes but because the flight was ready for taxiingso I had to purchase by my own again the rest of flights with ZERO reinboursement and ZERO responsibility by their part We all had paid same economic fair then why was the attitude n service different to different people The staff never smiled and seemed very unhappy Had to ask for items multiple times and the staff really didn t pro actively consider what you would want next Staff were not friendlyâ Their customer service is slow and they ask for baggage receipts you purchased way back in time as an excuse not to settle the claim The stopover at Abu Dhabi was short and had to catch the next flight almost running we informed the staff about the miss handling happened to us in T3 but she just mention weMy flight from London did not leave in time which left me panicked at Abu Dhabi then guided on the flight I even mentioned to the staff that the airline was not the same one on my boarding passDrunken abusive passenger who rampaged the entire flight totally unrestrained Sadly itâ s becoming the norm in economy class with most airlines to get little to no service After multiple attempts to speak and liase with Etihad they then notified us of a 500 no show fee and it was only then that they told us they d cancelled the entire flight and would not be giving us a refund despite me and my family giving them the business of 5 x business class flights Stop hiring un professional cheap staff This added to very long waiting times on hold to speak with someone and their generally poor service nowadyas caused us to cancel at enormous personal expense When arrived to the airport there was a very long que for inspection and were concerned that we will not catch our next flight to London due to the crowd in the airport Staff fairly unfriendly too the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble having flown with most airways this was probably the most stress free we paid to have extra leg room which wasâ so I wasnâ t expecting hot towel service however a modicum of some semblance to service would have been nice However my wife neither wanted to nor should have been compelled by your staff to leave 10kg of her personal belongings there in the first place Welcome to Factory Flying where Economy customers are herded into waiting areas squeezed into compressed space on the aircraft and treated with distain by flight attendants who have long ago lost sight of the corporate vision and mission statement You arrive at the door of the flight to find all the people in charge of the tour guides waiting for the passengers and trying to organize them at the door My seat massager was not working and half way through the flight my remote control stopped working Not too much to say as this flight left at 2 15 am and landed at 6 30 am Sadly the service has gone down and down especially on the return flight I have never experienced a similar service failure in my 30 plus years of flying to and from the Middle East food is horrible flight attendants are cold and didnâ t event want to show that they care or could do anything to satisfy us in matter of fact they seem like they donâ t want to be thereIt is clear that this airline are making massive cutbacks and they donâ t select or train their staff to the level they should be in this day and age Etihad didn t wow me at the check in counter although in fairness it was a late night flight and the airport was very busy There was a delay on the airline system and passengers were already queuing and stood for about 20 min before moving into the bus Extremely misbehaving and unprofessional staff First their ground staff damage your luggage and later their baggageâ A lot of people on the flight did not listen to the women flight attendants Very long flight and back ached by the end After a lot of fobbing off by the travel agent I passed the phone to the Etihad customer services rep who asserted that they had indeed made a mistake and berated them for their poor customer service Such miserable crew seems like there was a bad dynamic between the crew members The staff was extremely nitpicky throughout the journey to and from Turkey especially the Turkey staff which made us feel uncomfortable unwelcome and disregarded Its really sad to see a once such good airline surcumb to such budget cuts The male ground staff who was doing the final check in asked my husband and youngest daughter to step aside with the reason that their passports and boarding passes are not right he said And the sad part of the whole story is that the airline ground staff apologized for the inconvenience and gave me a voucher of USD 200 A full flight of people in one small area waiting for the systems to be back up and running Poor quality food no additional food i e self service snacks soft drinks during the night often available on US airlines where you can grab a snack on your way back from the restroom on your little airplane walkThe plane was old the seats were so uncomfortable the inflight entertainment was old difficult to use and of poor quality the services were unacceptable no menus on any of the flights on one flight we were passed a scrap of paper with the food choices written on it to pass on to the seat behind us the food was terrible the food choice we wanted was only available on two out of four of our flights small portions just a meal and a dry bread roll one drinks service no orange juice water services Upon collection of my bags I immediately noticed that the back of my Samsonite large pull along had been damaged through the course of the flight Having to pay for seats in economy that are uncomfortable to say the least the revolting slop they serve as a meal was totally inedible and not sufficient for a long haul flight obviously this is because they are now trying to get you to buy food from their new overpriced onboard menu wellBut just this one who seem to be the cabin crew manager is the worst I have come across maybe in a decade or 2 The staffs were just too busy explaining the reason of overbooking to other passengers For service on the plane is nothing to complainâ not only that we spend more than 30 min with no air inside the plane until my body got full wet and my wife blood pressure went down However I found it very unprofessional for the ground staff to keep passengers lined up at the gate for 2hrs before notifying them of the flight cancellation Iâ m sure if the staff hadnâ t helped in sorting this out I may well have missed my flight Would never fly etihad airways again problems started when staff unable to print us boarding passes for second leg of our journey meaning we almost missed our connecting flight same happened on return journey thenThe plane seemed much older which was evident by the in flight entertainment system same movies and tv shows but the screen was not as bright and was less responsive to touch and the seats which were much less comfortable and were extremely cramped Again with no communication from your staff people were just standing around not knowing what was going on Service seemed ok I thought and not unfriendly but half way during flightMy wife and I had to explain the baggage allowances to the staff member and indeed his supervisor No warm face towels crew did not come round with water However flight crew will collect the earphone and shut the entertainment system before landing and I found it weird as most of the airlines would not do soâ It would be better if Etihad breaks its contract with Jet as the later is a loss making airline and hence deteriorating service Left me feeling that all crew thought this way and I have been put off already I am regretting booking with them now the customer service number is a premium rate number if you call from a mobileIn terms of service and meals it didn t blow me away but the seating on offer was very comfortable and worth it Staff barely made eye contact and blunt in their communication and generally obvious that they were â unwillingâ The check in staff were excellent at all airports and couldnâ t fault them at all Shambolic customs in Abu Dhabi ground staff unhelpful etc which is apparent if there are problems like flight delays Last time I flew with them there was only 1 drinks service and the food was just about tolerable in saying that their prices are more than competitive flight times suit me down to the groundAfter a great deal of discussions with the airport personnel we indeed sadly had to let our two eldest children Martijn VAN SCHAIK and Pauline VAN SCHAIK board the plan as Martijn had school exams the following Monday and could not take the risk of waiting for another flight We were nervous as our connecting flight was within 90 minutes of our landing We asked the cabine crew team several times to fix the issues â frankly the ticket price was too expensive compared to the service The hostess were not helpful and not smilingBut it soon became obvious that the customer care was nowhere near what we have previously experienced Staff were not friendly at all almost to the point of being rude But no services at the sri Lankan airport Etihad was one of the only flights that took off during the snow storm We got letters stating that they airline wanted to compensate us but their off of airmiles and a free flight to Abu Dhabi a city that I never want to see again after being treated like dirt by the airline and airport staff and immigration was not acceptable The flight attendants work really hard but somehow always manage to do it with grace and endless patience They had partnership with the local flight there Alitalia and the flight got delayedif you want to risk flying ETIHAD camel airways then go for it cause 1 of there staff told me that even there dream liner is not a dream liner as seats all squished in they paint there old KLM aircraft up and refurb them to make then look like dream liner far from it They serve you beverage after one hour and no breakfast instead you are served lunch after 3 hours of flight time so that they can save money on food Unfortunately I was disappointed with the service from cabin crew and over all service Their staff need to be trained and more importantly they should be told by someone people at the business class pay 5 times of economy class and deserve a decent service 3 Missed a flight after 2 long flights was promised this would be organised by their staff 3 times and it wasn t Having traveled on 4 flights to and from Australia to Manchester UK the meals classed as complimentary are of a poor standard for international flights The ground airline staff in Manila Terminal 1 were bent on delaying me for some unknown reasonHowever I do expect professional and courteous staff and this was not the case on my recent flight This is by far a five star lounge and not easy to miss from terminal A Immediately upon entering the cleanliness of this lounge stood out not to mention how organized it was I have had more comfortable flights with budget airlines The stewardess offered no smile courteous acknowledgement no pride in carrying out her service Flying from Abu Dhabi felt sorry for the crew as the food on the menu was selectively loaded and so the prawn main dish was only one and the first passenger got it Then on rather long flights you were given no more leg room than on a Ryan Air or Easy Jet flight Delay in takeoff and kept passengers in the plane without any air conditioning My complaint to Etihad resulted in an offer of 5 000 points in their frequent flyer program Turned up to catch our flight home to Melbourne at 830 for an 1115am takeoff We did not get a hotel to rest until the next flight and had to sleep on the cold uncomfortable chair at the airport We were put on a different flight and they didn t even tell us The staff member tried to charge for the child seat for my son when in fact the Etihad website specifies that we must bring this seat if we wish for him to sit in his own seat Then I tweeted to Etihad airways and called the customer care of Etihad airlines before the take off of the flight But the surprise was that after the long flight there was no announcement we were close to landing offering a snack or at least a cup of coffee before arrival The staff werent helpful at all very rude and very up toâ honestly it was perfectly a disaster trip on etihad airline with a very high cost and disaster service and I had to stay at the airport for 12 hours to catch first flight going to Austin andThen once inside the aircraft the ground staff started taking away the large carry on luggage which should have been done before people could on board Actually we got there in time to board the plane but they already put us all in a next flight before we arrived which means they did that planned The food was a real catastrophe small portion without any test meat wasn t cook i tried many Air linesAlso they have NO right to refuse me to fly on my next flight as i met all health requirements listed on conditions to flyHowever food and beverage service has taken a bashing cut backs on in flight services clearly apparent and inflight crews seemed flustered and under pressure We had our first flight leaving from Brisbane with Etihad that wasnâ t to bad especially doing a night time flight most people are a sleep arriving in Abu Dhabi in the morning We tried to gain access to see someone at Sydney main offices but were turned away as we were not staff and did not have an appointment The service in the A380 is just so much less than in the smaller planes I have already flown for 70 hours with Etihad this year and choices of anything worth watching ran out a long time ago and the general levels of service from the cabin crew was poor but The most worst airline to travel ever in my life When we got to the office to rebook they said 2 of our bags were on the next flight to MNL but the 3rd was not Their service is in complete contrast and make Ethiad look like a budget airline When we boarded the staff seemed very busy and we were offered a drink 15 minutes after boarding Sadly Etihad did not meet my expectations which was mainly let down by the level of onboard customer attention I canâ t bare the thought of flying home with Etihad but safe to say I would never fly with this airline again Could not check my baggage for the Final Destination or get boarding passes for going flights Its much harder to get anyones attention and the personal service and welcome has reduced as you disappear into one of the multiple business seats The only problem I have with Emirates is that I feel so spoiled by their superior service and comfort that it is downright depressing to have to fly a different carrier afterwards About to set off on my next trip to Europe with Etihad I am v sad to find there is no chauffeur service as on pervious trips one of my main reasons for book with Etihad However I must have missed an announcement not to leave my seat and made my way to get some water when I noticed all the crew sitting at back of plane who upon seeing me had most of the female crew telling me quite rudely to take my seat without letting me speak The worst thing was the design of the new passenger reading light lamps they re fixed If you think this doesn t sound bad 6 other families on our same flight experienced the same left baggage issue Flight away was ok was in a 2 seater isle towards the back no screaming children no personal air vent hot cabin sweaty and sleepy because of the heat in the cabin the water run was BS dry as Staff very attentive whilst not being intrusive Staffs attitude in general is very biased for brown skin also i feel This is second time I m traveling in ethihad flight economy class is the same as other airlines so there is something to compliment food is average service is very slow air hostess showing their face towards me and not at all kind first time seeing air hostess like this Flight staff did nothing to manage the chaos Only thing that was not reduced are the tariffs that are still at the level of a premium airline Food is something you wonâ t miss in Etihad flights both for quality quantity and service90 percent of the time web bookings could not be completed which either leaves me a choice of spending a long time on the phone to customer services or trying a third party The standard of service in economy with Etihad has slipped over the last few years probably because they try to ensure all flights are full and offer low fares to achieve that aim After waiting for at least 15 minutes at the service desk the employee informed us that only Pauline VAN SCHAIK and Martijn VAN SCHAIK were registered for the flight to Amsterdam I understand the good reviews people are writing but an airline service is not about the food speed or what they offer when everything is ok 1 5 hours to check in our bags on return at Sydney airport very slow and just 4 desks open for a full flight Both of our flights the flight attendants appeared unhappy they were working economy and not business or first class The staff on most of the flights were not very happy The plane was an older type 777 showing signs of wear and the cabin staff a little restrained and not as customer focussed as we have experienced on other flights Etihad please sort out problems else will choose user friendly airline which allows online Checking Ever commenting on my outward flights to London via Abu Dhabi in May listing the poor food surly staff and basic lack of concern for passengers during the 9 and 14 hour flights This was a late night flight and plenty of turbulence was encountered Ground Staff at Manchester Airport Poor 2 Staff were disinterested and food bland The flight was ok but on a 14 hour flight you would expect more service The food service on our flight prior to this one was good on this particular flight the service and food offered was poor The airline staff promised us a hotel stay till the next flight which was 18 hours later The staff avoided contact where possible Their customer service takes endless time to connect or to respond back if you have any problem The service I received from a Hostess called Chelsea was second to none So if you are booking a flight with Etihad get ready to convert from veg to non veg snd receive extreme poor service along with some amazing bad wordsDisaster crew Even though my initial flight was delayed the staff made sure i was not going to be overly worried about my connecting when I called customer service they hung up on me This is a long flight that takes over 13 hours and yet when reaching the destination we have to stay in sky for at least another extra hour due to traffic at the airport where we land these kind of flights should be given the priority to land and not to torture passengers for extra hours We forgot a small sized bag in the plane and it was not possible for us or one of the staff to go back to the plane and just fetch it Quite apart from the age and tatty condition of the plane the service was non existent and the food was just ghastly YOUR ON SELLING OF OUR RETURN FLIGHT IS THE ISSUE The one board bar service was none existent having to buzz the cabin crew every time you wanted a drink the food or should I say lack of it wasnâ t good I attempted to use their internet service to rectify the problem but they say they will email me a confirmation number to confirm before I can accessâ I actually cannot believe that it was allowed on such a long flight We are illegal transit passengers of Etihad Airways as that male ground staff told us I honestly dread our return trip home with a Etihad in a couple of days and Iâ m already preparing to be met with a poor experience yet again This is extremely inconvenient as I chose this particular flight because of its short layover A tip you are not allowed to take water on the plane so take an empty bottle and get the cabin staff to fill it for you once onboard otherwise you can be asleep when water is brought roundI m not happy at all and wouldn t suggest Etihad as their service is not upto the mark It was a shock for us when the Etihad check in desk executive told us during the baggage drop there wont be any TV available in the whole flight but I wish they would keep their service that they became famous for Food again was mediocre staff seemed to be busy as they never stopped and asked if we would like anything or top ups again after dinner My parents flew business on the same plane and they said no one cared or took care of themA booking was made well in advance and there was no problem when it came to taking money but delivery of services was non existent We knew something more was happening because the cabin staff in our section went into panic mode Apart from collecting the dinner trays there was no other offer of service no drinks no rubbish collection just nothing Not mentioning the lack of a bar on a dreamliner the personal packs on Etihad have been slimmed down to a toothbrush with toothpaste a sleep kit eye mask and ankle socks and a tester aftershave with hand cream We had less legroom than my usual Swiss air flight to Zurich the plane seats wereâ I checked in this morning no order at checkin staff were completely unhelpful and unprofessional for business class and the price of a ticket for business class this level of service is completely unexceptionable I will choose another airline in future for my business trips We landed in KL and the sick passanger was taken by medical personnel Please look into my complaint that I raised thru your online feedback form for your reply to my tweet and also as responded by the customer care Missed my flight customer service was no help at all Entertainment systems have enough to keep you occupied a bit of a negative is that they dont turn on until in the air and get turned off about 35 mins before landing We froze back of plane had no heating 5 degree for 7 hour trip front of plane was over heating with passengers passing outFull flight and had back row allocated so not able to sleep as the loo was constantly being flushed Etihad did not impress nor could they even come close to the level of serviceThroughout the entire flight no snacks tea or coffee or even water offered and I can call etihad customer service line if I didn t like the compensation Service at economy level is substandard For the next three hours there was no crew member to answer our queries at the Izmir airport I expected better service from an airline such as etihad and also to be more fair in their treatment of customers inconvenienced by their own incpmpetance Staff were kept very busy but were very friendly and courteous can you imagine a passenger travelling from Mumbai to Moscow only with her passport without any money documents or any cabin bag only because your illiterate staff member didnâ t know the baggage allowance policy The upsetting part of the experience is the airline staff at the airport A very unfortunate combination of normal airline and low cost business model Staff where great could not do enough but there wasâ TV screen didn t work for the first flight of 8 hours Staff responds no the flight is full cannot move you This is a clear case of racial discrimination and lack of knowledge of Eitihad staff The air hostess and stewards were lack lustre and very slow in attending to calls Airline staff seated us in closer to the doors so he didnâ t have to go so far On my return my suitcase had been damaged and almost impossible to speak to the customer service to see what they can do The service of checking was very slow My last few flights menat that we were boarded almost two hours before take off and that makes a long haul flight that much more uncomfortable Note if you travel with awards you can t web check in which I found like the ground staff not good Flight attendants said they would fix it but never did One of the staff members sees us and our baby and says sorry you cannot have the bassinet as the baby is too big It is a hard enough flight without dealing with this airline Cabin crew looked tired noticed that theyâ Staff say they don t know but ask ground staff at abu dhabi I had to call the service center more than 10 times and my calls were dropped consistently This is our first time using this airline definitely not again the after care and customer service is appaulling I am legally blind and sometimes service can beTo top it all off we were then greeted with the most unhelpful and disinterested staff who could not care less as to our situation We even pleaded with the checking counter staffs while they were processing for another customer but they didn t pay heed to our concerns To start with the air hostess had it all over her face that she should beâ On contacting the Customer care centre at Mumbai Airport the lady is very rude and does not hear to our complaint The staff wasn t rude but not smiley either The customer service is sub par the entertainment is average at best and the general enthusiasm of staff throughout the entire experience was sufficiently underwhelming Not very efficient a lot of service gaps after my transit in Abu dahbi we ll get onto a better plane wrong I didn t think this was possible but the plane we changed into was even worst we arrived 50 minutes before flight time I decided to go to the counter to try to check our luggage or buy myself a ticket for the following day while my family wife 3 year old and 1 year old went to passport control to attempt to get the flight where they realised I had the boarding passes on my phone Alas there were no pyjamas the seating in business class was very small and uncomfortable and the service was slow and not particularly good I told the staff that I will stand there till he gives me a boarding pass or get me Etihad Mumbai staff at last I was given a boarding pass Incorrect information was given by the check in staff at Manchester Airport re connecting flights which caused undue concern Since it is such a long flight I prefer to be left alone to sleep Nothing was too much trouble for flight attendantseven we told him that nothing mention in our boarding pass and airport staffOurs thankfully were not but they were only checked through to Heathrow which meant we had to collect and recheck them in half an hour before our next flight was due to depart Heathrow which meant we nearly missed our connection something we were later informed by ground staff could have been done at Edinburgh We sat staring at the airline staff at the gate waiting for some form of communication from them of which there was none Staff is not smily unfriendly and sometimes rude on board Cabin staff spent much of the time out of sight and there was no one checking regularly for refreshments especially water The flights to India are chronically overbooked and the probability of getting bumped to the next flight which in most cases is the next day is high Dear Customer Service Recently I had to travel to Islamabad Pakistan on a very short notice for a family Emergency and this email was directed to customer relations the same people I had no response from who apologised and offered Â 27 refund for a window seat and a small amount of air miles which were worthless Couldnâ t find fault with anything absolutely first class service on each leg of the journey None of there customer service agents respond to your baggage claim Our first flight with Etihad certainly will not be our last I can sleep absolutely anywhere but really struggled to get comfy as the bottom lolumber part of my back just kept going numb due to the lack of room I realise long haul flights in economy are no picnic but was really disappointed in the poor service and really ordinary food on this flight However this time the staff weren t that helpful I had paid extra for priority check in and wanted to confirm with staff that I was allowed to wait in the business class line My girlfriend had tried numerous times during the flight to get the attention of the flight attendants and one time had her light on for half an hour before anyone came to see her I hope they realize how diligently and hard their staff is working for the airlineâ s benefit but in vain there was no employees present at Nas office thank you for using a low fare airline Etihad After selecting my seat next to the window for sleep flight left at 8pm Please Please take care of the travelers you don t know what they are going through and gone through Temperature on the flight was fine and food was brought at sensible intervals but was pretty uninspiring and not very tasty even by airline food standards On the return flight I specifically asked at check in if getting my connection with just a hour of landing would enough time knowing Iâ d have to go through transit queues Given that all water had had to be surrendered an hour before boarding due to Australian safety regulations it would have been good if we had been offered some water or juice as soon as the staff knew there would be a delay Even if the Check In was pretty fast the staff was unpolite and hard to understand The cabin crew seemed to pay very little attention to the passengers and there was no smile on their faces The staff seem not enthused about the passengers Cabin crew pleasent but looked shabby and looked as if there maybe better jobs as they were bored I travel with my own noise reduction head phones expect to able to use during the entire flight The flight attendant said that they do not serve hot meal for shortâ running from T to T because of staff miss handling When I got to uk I called customer service and was given email address which I emailed to and was asked to send supporting documents and still not heard anything as I asked how long for process butHOWEVER no one not even airport staff could get any guidance from Etihad The staff was less friendly and a bit unapproachable Also I shall mention their massive selections of in flight entertainment system will not let you get bored during any of those 13 15 hours long flights staff did absolutely nothing After numerous miscommunications the Doha to Dubai Etihad shuttle bus took us to a different drop off point than was booked staff were very unhelpful The ground staff in Abu Dhabi lacked the experience to deal with the dozen or so passengers that had suffered a similar fate The service was slow as it took a couple of hours to get our dinner So I gave it a 7 because honestly I was expecting a bit better service not from the cabin crew itself but from the customer service people Etihad Airways really needs to work on getting a better lot for their customer service because I had some issues where I needed to changeâ I wish for such a long flight two hot meals are served nd at Toronto airportThey have downgraded their service for business travellers and it now feels like it is a low cost option airline To cut a long story short nothing was done about it either on the plane or afterwards by customer service Nothing was too much for the staff In addition given the crammed condition of the economy class I requested assistance from the crew to recline my seat as several trials for the same failed OR b missing the last connecting flight that I had been scheduled on But the service of food was not up to the mark with the other facilities offered and not only that when the flight departing or landing the crew asking me to get all my son staff into the closer 22hrs in the air plus wait time in Abu Dhabi The sector between Cairo and abu dhabi didn t serve Alcohol due to Ramadan which was a shame as i just started my leave and a glass of wine will have been nice to start the long flight to singapore George didnâ t apologise for interrupting and didnâ t even notice that I was there or that there was a passenger who paid 8K to use their complete services not just being on the plane services that start from greeting the passenger at the airport There is nothing quite like stepping off a plane from a long haul flight having just had a shower Shabby plane felt like i was travelling on the Broadmeadows line train Shabby uniforms on staff colors are dreadful and looked like they were 15 years old Disinterested attendants who could barely look at me let alone be pleasant With just over an hour before our next flight to Nairobi there was no time to hang around Flight was delay and connecting flight gate closed before flight time without waiting and announcing Consequently the in flight entertainment was hit missI regret this decision their service is sub par and the food is OK not great Going back to Emirates where the gap between economy and business is not defined by service Had slight problem with online checkin when trying to change seat position which was resolved by check in staff Business class staff seemed to be more concerned when they could take their own breaks rather than making sure that we the passengers were being taken care of I had missed my flight as it was erroneously marked my departure time by Thomas Cook in Bexleyheath London but could only get a one way flight for Â 500 MyWhat everyone enjoys travelling overseas is that it all works out is well organised minimum of take off delay and good in flight service Crazy and the only airline which seems to do this which I have flown on in recent times would be to help you with your business but the only thing customer service cares about is their business Everything is just terrible right from food customer service to their wait times because of the level of disorganization I asked at Manchester for seats together and was told I would have to go to customer services in Abu Dhabi and ask there I did need to ring customer service before my flightEtihad Airways should have better trained staff to listen to our complaints The first flight was horribly crowdedThe Lady at the customer service told me that there s no other flight flying out that dayUnfortunately we were so tired we neglected to get any of the staff names and payroll numbers in order to include them here They have made my parents who are 60 and medically unfit sit in front of Travel Help Desk for 12 hours since they missed in the connecting flight Also the staff should ensure that the environment has a pleasant smell throughout the flight which was sadly not the case especially AUH MXP Nor was there any reassurance to the many anxious customers expecting to miss the flight that in fact they would be allowed on the flight It seems as though the Etihad service team is purposefully avoiding to give us the confirmation The staff is trained to intimidate the customers and the concept of customer service does not exist for them ground staff was not polite but on board staff was good Ground staff were not helpful either at AbuDhabi andYou will not feel the taking off and landing of an airplane They told me they were also concerned and would let the ground staff know of a possible infection No enough information on directions for passengers you need to keep asking questions and staff weren t friendlyOf course customer care does nothing afterwards The staff were impatient and more than a little short to a number of passengers particularly to 2 young women trying to cope with an upset child At that point we were not given any additional direction about where to fill out this paperwork despite again having a short connection time before our next flight to CEB Normally I cannot sleep long flight even business class and watch 4 or 5 movies but this time with Etihad I only watched 2 movies and after that I went to sleep 30 minutes later now bloody mad and 3 00 we advised to back to the hotel and talk to the hotel desk to get our next flight time at 7 00am But inside flight male hostess service mind is not helpful and not feel polite with guests also non veg dishes not avilable once reach the middle raw of flight If your flight is at 11 am local time start this process at 9 30 am latest even if you have to wait by the gate Eihad staff didnt know that you are not allowed to bring umbrellas in carry on Initial flight from Bangkok delayed causing numerous passengers to just miss connection at Abu Dhabi Almost missed my flight today company call center is nightmare The service level has dropped and they are not quite the airline they used to be Instead of giving me the same direct ticket for the next day flight they gave me two flights from Abu Dhabi to LHR and LHR to Chicago on next day Upon my suggestion the staff member began to search flights via London Heathrow We were required to collect boarding passes before boarding the third plane and the ground staff were reluctant to issue them 40 mins before take off It seems that those who fly business class or first class have had positive experiences with Etihad but not so much so in Economy re staff attitudes towards passengers rudeness uncomfortable seats food water I get quite nervous the crew made sure I was okOnly issue was not being able to choose seat until 24hrs before flight time So aside from the general underwhelming quality of the flight and the one service food provision 5 of an hour into a 7 hour flight I m really here to talk overbooking Staff was edgy and not very pleasant although they did have to deal with some difficult passengers as well Only when the child threw up everywhere at the end of the flight did a crew member come over to offer some wipes You cannot give this place the name of an Airport there was just one hall with the check in counters for every destination totally overcrowded and extremely noisy Well I wish I could come to you today with an enthusiastic way of dealing with a problem that has aroused to one of your ETIHADâ s guest The food was appalling a couple of servings of water and the rest of the flight passed I successfully bid for two neighbour free seats so I could get some sleep on a long haul flight but only one was provided on boarding the service was hopeless and the seats were very clustered Now when I eventually boarded the flight Gate check in staff moved my seat to an area without extra leg room Press the call button and get no response from cabin staff my flight time was 2 50am and I tried to deal with my concern The second leg we are opposite ends of the same row no change to reallocated maybe because it is not 24 hours before that leg of the flight yet My parents experience was not at all good with this Airlines which can be summarised by the fact that the airline staff was taking more than an hour to provide water to them leave aside other services A short time later I buzzed staff to find out about the report number and at least bring me some ice I requested the staff for a blanket replacement without blinking the eye the air hostess said cannot give I asked another hostess too as it was cold and a long flight still The facilities on board were good however the plane was hot and the staff did not seem to care for exampleOn this first leg of our flight one of our group got physically sick on board Even regular economy class flight felt upgraded compared to other flights I ve taken Btw in my recent visit in June my flight was delayed due to some airline system issue I was in bed in the Abu Dhabi airport hotel and just falling asleep when I received a call to inform of flight changes Etihad delay caused us to miss our new connecting flight in london ground staff in abudhabi are not great and boarding is chaotic The supervisor have called the staff as he witnessed what happened and came back to tell me thatâ s he promises that he will find it and make sure it will be on the flight without even apologizing While the crews were chatting away the flight started to descend and there was no one to take away my tray After contacting customer service of Etihad after the flight they truly didn t care or try to make amends I have now switched from other Airlines based on same service cheaper price The seats are hard unconformable and leg room is poor for an airline vaunted as having a great service Eventually sorted out but what a poor show and all the passengers incurred additional cost and the answer from the staff was I cant help contact out Service center Decline in service and amenity since flights last year It s understandable that holiday travel could create rush hour like that morning s but the ground staff showed neither interest nor competence in solving the problem 11 hours after departure the flight attendant offered me a coffee or pastry which I declined as I said was still waiting to be served lunch I arrived at Mumbai to see an airport staff not the Etihad staff waiting for me he said he has no boardingNow he need to wait until tomorrow for the next available flight loosing his meeting The connection service for on going flight to Dublin was like a cattle crush no organization hundreds jamed into small hot laneway Every attempt to talk to the ground staff at the help desk that services Etihad and 6 other airlines was met with a rude response or a I do not know We were cold during entire flight and thay didn t have enough blankets for all passengers I take approximately 30 long haul flights every year plus a bigger number of short haul flights The service on the Etihad plane was good which made the lack thereof on the ground even more of a disappointment With all the good things that Etihad boasts about we were quite excited but it turned out to be a disappointment right from our first flight The food and service on the flight was very basic and not of bad quality ansone of our baggage did not come with the others and we got it only in the next flight Customer services sent me a standard reply which of course avoided the main issue and credited me 10000 points to my Frequent flyers account a value of aroundÂ 100 The first flight was on a 12 year old Boeing 777 that definitely felt long in the tooth On all four flights the lights were turned on and off at strange times causing disturbance why not just use a soft light and leave people to sleep especially on the longer flight segments You will not have any help from company front desk as their employee have a very poor level of understanding of their own company and have absolutely no autonomy to solve issues 12 1 2 6 1 2 hours cramped into one of their seats on these long haul flights was a killer No help was given by economy class staff to speed up business class queue However they changed my Flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Mumbai saying that the evening flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi was cancelled Seats changed after we paid for preferred no explanation we were then split up across the aircraft my wife was pestered by a drunken passenger which I had to deal with three times and cabin crew kept supplying this customer with alcohol even though they knew he was drunk The air hostess couldn t even help us to sit together but even that was not enough to increase the flight quality Not a good flight Toilets were filthy 15 20 minutes after take off only and again commenting it to the flight attendant he closed it off i must say that its not the same standard of some other airlines the interactive TV did not workThe air inside the cabin is very hot even though the sun has gone down Kids did not receive any goodie at the beginning of the flight either it wasn t the fact that we didn t get the spare the seat it was the way it was handled by the staff and subsequently as well as charging us for it The staff does not seem to worry about customer s comfort but they wanted us to talk to the local airlines where no one was there to answer He also not eat and we looked under with shy because of the behavior of crew All in all really average service compared to its direct competition from neighboring hubs The initial flight from Munich to Abu Dabiwas not only delayed by 1 5 hours sitting on the tarmac we then had to rush to join our connecting Etihad flight to Melbourne And theses staff got all the flight attendants attention to the detriment of paying passengers one thinks maybe we wonâ t be flying Etihad again this was the view of several of the first class passengers not just ourselves It was only after making it clear that this was unacceptable a more senior staff member Dom Muna arranged flights to Amsterdam via Frankfurt 8 hours later Unlike other top notch airlines there was no customary introduction by the service manager the flight attendants lacked hospitality no sleeper suits on the ultra long haul flights including one overnight one limited menu choices The in flight service too wasn t any great During return on the longer way from BRU to AUH we were told that we had to book meals and the crew didn t provide us any food Another thing was i had been allocated two seats free of cost before i decided to upgrade them so if they could not give me the seats i paid extra for why did they not put us back in the initial seats and refund the money as the service which was paid for could not be provided Iâ m not sure what the hype is with the Dreamliner as it was cramped and the service no better than any other Etihad flight The range of entertainment was unimpressive the food was absolutely dreadful verging on inedible even a member of the cabin staff was laughing at the snack offering at the end of the flight into London the staff member who checked us in in Abu Dhabi was verging on incompetent and the overall experience was very disappointing This is the second time i am troubling with this airline my flight scheduled on early morningGround staff Jet left wanting EVA Air who offer direct flights were 500 more expensive also I will never ever use this air line againFor a business class ticket this type of service and lack of meal preparation is absolutely unacceptable â especially for a 16 hour transatlantic flight International flight was cancelled from Abu Dhabi so I rerouted through British Airways and they FAILED to reroute my luggage back to my final destination Service is good if you call them as they will not approach to you as they are afraid you will ask for something There were a few flight attendants that seemed to show a bit of frustration but overall it was okay To cut a long story short I eventually met a lady called kelly and a man called Oscar at baggage service in domestic where we were sent at midnight to collect our bags ourselves who were superb afb sorted everything out to the best of their ability I have been flying on Etihad Airways for more than 8 years now and over they years they continue to awe me with their service During the flight no one of the staff came and asked if i a mum traveling solo with a young child needed help Sitting in an aisle seat meant regular bumping by staff passengers and their bags as they passed by My first flight Geneva to Abu Dhabi was delayed for 1 5 hours initially for thunderstorms and then due to a mechanical issue with the cargo doors uoi could not fault their entertainment service and food was somewhat better than most plane food Flight boarded on time then we sat and we sat no explanations On my flight from Brussels due to the long queuing for the passport control I couldn t enjoy the lounge and have my breakfast and pil against fear of flying so I informed the flight attendant if I could have some water When we got to MNL we were told that none of our 3 checked bags made it onto our flight and they would be delivered on the next flight and we needed to fill out paperwork after going through immigration When the snack cart came around later I asked for my purchased items and staff were clueless I wouldn t have had an issue if the air hostess had offered an apology and said sorry sir we ran out of it There were some issues on the return flight some of which were out of the airline staff control not enough non vegetarian meals Food and beverage service cannot be faulted I have noticed a steady deterioration in all aspects of the flight I called the customer service line the following day to sort out the issue with the voucherThe day of my supposed return flight from Delhi on April 19th which flight had been cancelled both Etihad and One Travel sent me the usual kind message reminding me of my up coming flight on the 19th I wouldn t write that comment if it would have been an exemption but the following 2 flight segments from Abu Dhabi to Nairobi and from Nairobi back to Abu Dhabi had exactly the same level of quality I will avoid EY on Eco for future flightsA 787 Dreamliner is too cramped for a 13 14 hour long haul flight it needs to be an A380 20 minutes later those staff had also vanished and we were left with no idea what was going on I usually book at the rear of economy because in a less than full aircraft there is less passangers Disinterested staff mush food awful seats hopeless website Got an information that technical staff are trying to fix plane WITHOUT additional equipment and if it will happen you HAD TO fly on it otherwise there would be NO REFUND But the other side of the company is ground staff which is just below any decent level and lacks basic skills Unsmiling and disinterested cabin staff generally very poor service standard of food poor This has gone down the hill in customer service airport services travel quality and even food As with most air lines there were no menus in cattle classWhile flying Etihad you almost have no choice but to use Abu Dhabi and t is not the best airport in the world at this point schedule the in flight service isn t at the same level it was before This is a systemic failure of their IT department to such an extent that its not impossible that hundreds of thousands of air miles are being lost by many ETIHAD flyers who use the UPGRADE options Before the flight I got shafted by a member of the check in crew who charged me 270 Euro for luggage overweight and no negotiating or reasoning possible even though Iâ The served food on board was ok but the presentation is more towards what I imagine getting on a stainless steel tray while wearing an orange coverall the staff is too busy and seems to be overwhelmed with a full aircraft and I have been loyal customers of Ethiad over the past five years flying scores of flights andStaff do not seem as attentive as the last few flights we have had with Etihad Now I can understand youâ re trying to increase revenue by charging customers 35 for seat selection via their travel agent because your online option was constantly not working but the cost cutting well thatâ s another thing On arrival at Changi I met up with other passengers from the flight and this is where confusion really set in there was no Etihad staff to assist us and when a staff member did arriveA further 3 calls to the Service Centre speaking face to face with the Customer Service people in the First Class lounge at Abu Dhabi airport on the 2nd April and still nothing As for the rest everything was top class from the staff to the flight itself and to the condition of the seatThe staff were great could not recommend them higher But it stays hot with the sun beating on it the entire flight Also trying to get frequent flyer points awarded if using a partner airline like Virgin can take months and many frustrating calls From check to cabin crew to my lost luggage on the return flight the Etihad staff were ranging from surly to downright rude The Business Class lounge was so full it was hard to find a seat but that was the least problem The cabin crew made the whole experience a good one and made up for the 1 hour take off delay and the long flight Etihad has become a LOW SERVICE HIGH COST airline with their 20 kg max bag allowance their horrendous poor meals their prohibitive extra weight policy for which they charge you 40 for EVERY extra Kg the extremely uncomfortable seats with reduced reclining capacity and the rudeness of the crew the most arrogant uneducated low class stewardesses in the market The customer service was second to none All in all in flight staff make up a little for other disappointments but it s not enough I had never flown Etihad and flying on this long haul flight worried me After the first 45 minutes of waiting with no announcement as to why and for how long the flight was delayed I asked the Cabin Manager we booked our allocated seats together which took us 5 attempts this was still not working so called the customer service team Mostly I have an issue with the leg room I am tall or its the attitude of the staff The seats and space on 13 hour long haul flight were smaller and tighter than the 6 hours flights which doesnt make sense why make the space smaller for longer flights A cabin crew member came and spoke with my brother and organised some fruit and offered scrambled egg which he could take off the bread and eat my brother turned this down due to possible cross contamination which would make him very ill The ground staff was not helpful and inhuman having seeing us traveling with Children and a Snr This air line has no idea of service specifically business class service Yucky stinking toilets average food and unfriendly staff When you travel from ETIHAD you do expect the quality service and same happened with me Air Bus 380 on the first leg which has a little more seat space than other planes The only thing I do not like about most of these airline companies are that they can change the type of plane atâ and they keep on charging on every silly thing they could make money from such as paid seat selection even within a span of 24 hours of flight Business class is very very bad not food not services and not amenities like pigiamaâ Needless to say service was impeccable The only little hiccup was some uneasy service especially from one young male air hostess who made some unwelcoming childish jokes on me when I was about to aboard the air craft and later by insisting coffee at my table although it was politely refused and later protested Additionally the experience boarding in Brisbane was a joke hardly any Etihad staff doing the check in they could ve used an extra attended or 3 as it appeared they were understaffed and had a hard time keeping passengers in their seat after announcements to stay seated On the leg from Abu Dhabi to Edinburgh the staff were not so engagingInflight service was spotty food inedible Somehow i felt the crew were not enjoying their job they hardly smiled The attitude of all staff was I couldn t care less Then a short time before the holiday Etihad announced via e mail there would be no direct flights and that I would have to fly Flybe to Heathrow and pick up the flight onward to Abu Dhabi from there but Never I had such flight On the Abu Dhabi JFK flight my daughter developed motion sickness but we did not want to ask cabin crew for medication due to risk of interactions with other medication she is taking No help from ground staff no explanations while in the flight andPlus we usually stop for a chat with the cabin crew and quite often the pilot At least I have never experienced anything else ever when traveling long flights Not a bad flight had a short stopover in Abu Dhabi The air conditioning was set to freezing so that we had to wear jackets and blankets the whole trip from Sydney to Abu Dhabi despite lots of people complaining The mother could not open the toilet door she asked the air hostess who did not speak just shook her head and there are no more bus for the service not one member of staff from the online support customer service desk nor any of the depressed on board flight team was willing to help and not even an utterance of an apology Flying is expensive for me so I have to fly economy and don t expect a first class service I hope this review brings to notice the problems we faced with the check in staff and hope appropriate actions measures were taken Also the flight from London to Abu Dhabi we felt one of the air stewardess to be cold and unfriendly no smile andFlying from Manchester to abu Dhabi first part of the flight to the maldives standed seats standed service nothing special no duty free cannot take booze in or out of the maldives just like flying tui or thomas cook did its job no banter with the staff at allâ The crew did not allow the passengers to come out of the aircraft and served only the water for over 5 hours and had to suffer in a very hot environmentâ Both outward leg and return from Abu Dhabi to Perth seats in economy very very uncomfortable good very average staff ok leg room average better than budget airlines but only justStaff were on hand to chase you through the terminal building and up to security telling you to hurry Spent hours trying to speak to someone they have no customer service and every number I callThe staff was rude and incompetent especially the ground staff in Abu Dhabi The flight was not a very comfortable one and the crew was mostly insensitive to the guests need A long flight and after 3 4 hours into the flightBut overall not a bad flight Worst Airline to Travel in Business Class from New DelhiNo service for soft drinks when food was eventually served and staff then disappeared Two long haul flights back to back and SYD Abu Dhabi is a really long one 14 hours in the air but apart from that the flight with Etihad could well match my experiences flying around the globe with some of the other better carriers like Emirates Singapore Airlines or Air New Zealand I have travelled with the assistance of a wheelchair through the airports due to a Bone Disease Passenger asked to move seats so staff could use seats to sleep in And flight attendants were hardly aroundAlcohol service was only offered 1 hour before landing NYC Etihad are just a budget airline and even have written incident reports about aircraft having issues yet management take shortcuts and band aid the problems wonder why there staff use different airline when they fly for holiday 1 said rather pay full price and get to my destination than to pay next to nothingDO NOT FLY with this company if you miss your flight they take your Full fare and do not credit your return when they charge you again for the next flightI was on their A380 business class from Abu Dhabi to London on 07 May 2019 and unfortunately the service was an absolutely shamble Flight Time 6hrs 54mins On asking flight attendant if they were kidding she embarrassedly replied that was what was provided Their cabin staff on both flights Singapore to AUH and AUH to JFK was downright rude to the point where I didn t dare ask for a drink or any other assistance as they were snappy and sassy For a long haul flight I would not use Etihad again By creating a ruckus with the in flight staff over seat allocation they delayed the flight by nearly two hours resulting in our missing the connecting flight from Abudhabu to Chennai Service from the flight attendant was mechanical and lacking enthusiasm The food service started and my first disappointment arose as my booked meal choice of Asian Vegetarian did not appear Also less than friendly staff I was rudely awakened by staff advising that the ECONOMY seat i had taken needed to be paid for REALLY My surprise was to find completely the opposite the flight attendants are absolutely not kind the food is small and they do not serve water during night as all otherâ I was repeatedly told itâ s airline policy to overbook and if I donâ t buy the seats in advance I thought Online check in is only optional but itâ s a ruse to get more money a cheap way by airlines like Etihad the seats will be sold to who checks online and buy another staff told its first come first serve What about a confirmed ticket then who will honor that Flights have always left on time cabin crew was amazing the first time I was a nervous flyer as never flown beybut they made me feel at ease was regularly provided drinks and snacks and meals all included in the price The in flight service is less than average But getting terrible seats for two very very long flights is Wasn t offered a menu at the start of the flight so didn t know what we were getting Cramped seats unresponsive staff on flight didn t come when pressing the call button Food aweful had the same meal for evening meal and breakfast next morning very disappointed not the business class service iâ m used to unfriendly staff very average meals been hearing a lot about emirates but then i flew etihad because of the price it offered for my 24 hours of flight to brisbane with a lay over at abu dhabi Business class cabin was full and there were just 2 staff working really difficult and resulted in a poor service This will be the last time I will be using the services with Eithiad if they do not fix it soon Etihad have stopped their direct service from Edinburgh to Abu Dhabi Regrettably standards and service appear to have diminished on all four flights The customer care on the flights and on the ground was second to none My husband picked up a flu and was not well the whole flight home Having taken 30 return international flights in the last twelve months and trying Etihad for this first time will not bother coming back until they update their operating procedure to be a little more customer focussed Not even say apologise from the guest relations service Customer careand I regret not taking Qatar Airways that I always take for long flight Latina national my child start to move and want to play and seems to become a bit hard to calm him down which been notice by the crew memberCustomer Service from Etihad did not care about any customer It was uncomfortable sleeping on the business seat without beddings which I was told was only offered at longer flight After handing over the phone to an Etihad employee of the airport three times there was still NO solution Quite slow at check in and then a full flight Very disorganised an not enough desk staff to process passengers in a hot air port terminal Staff not so cain The head rest on the seat had a permanent side fixture that was uncomfortable to sleep against making for a longer flight Despite being a member of Etihad s travel club problems began for us even before the flight when we found significant issues using both the airline s website booking service and the app JFK lounge needs immediate attention as the level of service has deteriorated considerably it took me another 3 hours the main reason I booked the specific flight from Abudhabi to Bangalore is to beat the traffic by arriving at 3 20 am Diet didn t eat anything the whole flight due to my allergies Long flight It was my first flight with Etihad I expect a very comfortable flight and got disappointed The customer service would not even look at our paperwork Would have been a good flight if not for the brats behind me Return flight from Europe to Melbourne via Amsterdam Abu Dhabi Good flight until Abu Dhiba where the airport transfer a mess having to go through security a real bun flight long delays some people strugling to get connections The ground staff at Abu Dhabi airport did not have a clue how to manage a full flight If you plan to fly any long haul flight with the airline I would suggest a hearty meal before hand or you will land at your destination hungry as we did At the beginning of our flight the plane was rather hot And in flight service isn t bad We flew from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi when a passanger got sick and pilot had to divert the flight to KL I filed a complaint with Etihad to voice our disappointment regarding their abysmal customer service and their reply was to offer to pay for our cabthe in flight service was so much second rate and there was no comparison to its middle east competitors We queued in the family section and made it to the counter within 20minutes or so When we arrived at the counter the staff member was unfamiliar with Etihad check in allowances and protocols for infants children This service wasn t available on my flight and only found out on the day i flew out With Etihad the level of service goes down significantly when they are full There was no information of shifting of Bus pick up location at Dubai and had to miss the bus caught a taxi to Abu dhabi airport at least they could have called my telephone if I had not shown up in time the flight attendants rarely smiled and service was up there with the worse we have ever experienced My main problem is with the standard of serviceBut the service was not there as we could have expected All bar one of the staff at this location were unhelpful completely unfriendly and seemed to lack knowledge on Etihad processes and systems Call the customer service they said there is nothing they can do No snacks and it all seemed like too much effort for the cabin crew I did find the last leg the staff not quite so caring but still as good as most airlines The clerk took more than 1 hour delaying my check in needed to make multiple calls to correct his first mistake after I pointed this out to him and his supervisor failed to re seat me next to my family during the name change exercise promised there would be no problem when returning from NYC could not check in on line in NYC preassigned seat was again lost customer services responses were of no use they had no way to assist Amenities were also lacking for long haul flights no eye cover toiletries etc I said I was going to because the crew was so overwhelmed with the overbooking in the flight that could not attend everyone properly and let me out of the flight It looked like a unhappy staff with no smile No staff at counter The plane seemed to be an old one with very limited seating space in a Business Class seat I would please request you to escalate my full complaint to your superiors as I would like them to understand how even your customer care has declined This time the seats were very uncomfortable for such a long flight the food was a disaster There are 24 A320s in the Etihad fleet the largest proportion of their fleet so expect this experience particularly for shorter haul international flights All that with no minimum customer care at all We have never expected this kind of service from Etihad I felt the level of onboard service has dropped and feels like it is due cost saving â Service and hostess not nice Trays meal very bad uncomfortable seats and planes are not cleaned wellI can t review the serviceThe cab was very cheap but we never should have had to take it given that staff said we would be given assistance The cost wasnâ t that much of a difference but the service totally unacceptable Cabin staff while efficient were unmotivated The crew were pleasant enough although one female crew member made it quite clear that she didnâ t want to be there by her obnoxious and cold attitude who later commented that she didnâ t like the Dreamliner because there were no bunks My husband and Itravelled on this airline for fisttime on a very long flight to kerala Coming from a long flight it was a bad experience for me Ethihad are closing their flights to Perth shortly and to a passenger it seemed that it didnt really matter what the service was like as they werent looking for further bookings out of Perth Return flight was even worse overweight took out belongings ques massively long and delayed again due to air traffic They are having latest movies showing on board and staffs are OK Not good customer service Etihad Overall the flight experience was inadequate because of the tight fistedness of the airline No fresh towelettes for long haul flights And inflight service is good but however I always wonder why is their business lounge in airport if absolutely unfit to accommodate a number of their business passengers No one took care of us but I didn t feel like a guest of a premium airline due to the following reasons Staff changes between cabins and the crew seems fresh for such a long flight It took over an hour for staff to come and help me with a tv that wasnâ t working If there was no seat in the next flight they should have let me stayed in IslamabadThe rest of the sector from Abu Dhabi to Kochi was unremarkable and the food served on return flight home to London was just average And their customer service sucks no answerthe check in was tedious they do not have enough staff for the number of people checking in for the outbound flight we pre checkedHowever the little discomforts in travelling in economy class in such single ailed aircraft is more than compensated by their nice in flight services but flight schedule was not suitable for me The only flight they didn t cancel was the Rome to Barcelona leg Very under qualified staff lower than average service and pathetic breakfast Really lousy inflight service in Abu Dhabi to Manchester sector There was a good balance between attentive service and being left to sleep on the 13 hour flight We were thirsty and hungry the food was absolutely disgusting and not much of it which is probably fortunate although it was an awfully long flight to be unfed and unattended to and I had to leap of the staff member for this before she ran off for a 5th time Why canâ t Etihad have the minimum courtesy of rebooking their flights when they made the choice of pulling them out from their previously scheduled flight the bottom line is I almost never enjoyed flying with this airline especially on the longer stretch of Abu Dhabi to New York which happens to be my more frequent flights Seating was uncomfortable air system was not working really well and the food for the kind of reviews people gave this airlineso I requested staff to change my seat so that i will be close to my family butAs an obviously Jewish traveler flying through UAE during Ramadan seemed a little scary though Etihad was perfectly professional provided my kosher meals appropriately and generally seemed polite though colder than usual for international flights But the worse of all is the lack of effective ground services checkin procedures for business class are not at par with other airlines The only criticism I have is the parking of the Edinburgh flight a long way from the terminals and a long bus ride The in flight entertainment was really not that great Service was lacking had to get my own 2nd drink I requested the cabin crew for a cake which was part of the menu and there was a harsh reply from them that they dont serve it for special meals Their baggage department is the most worst department among the top world class airlines When it was our turned the counter staff told us rudely to go to the main line as there should not be any special treatments for families so I called the Service Centre who advised that there was a glitch with the system and that the issue would be resolved and the miles would be allocated A long flight but the cabin staff were brilliant and we aren t receiving any service from them at all This is not the customer service which we expect from Etihad Airways But they donâ t care what Business Class customers have to say to them really and will always defend rather than listen to their customers It was quite a long flight The staff were not helpful with storing baggage or making sure our stuff was close to usIt s just too uncomfortable for long haul flights The remote control didn t work for the whole flight and the touchscreen is finicky On very long trips you expect a bit more than an average service and we wondered how an airline of this caliber would not be conscious to handle this correctly for its own nationality passengers The service was not as good asâ I as a code share passenger wasn t allowed to select a seat online called up their customer serviceIn my opinion to test a service quality of an airline one must fly the economy class i went all the way down to manila with stop over in Abu Dhabi its a long flight but not exhausted when i reach the otherThe plane was well used tray table needed maintenance the food ordinary and a beer hard to get Check in starts too late with too few staff massive queues just made it on to flight Seats in Economy were very narrow making it very cramped on such a long flight the food was awful and the air conditioning was so cold everyone was putting on parkas and beanies if they had them The A380 was a far superior experience seat and comfort wjse to the older boeing i had from Syd Dxb but the service on all my flights couldn t be faulted the moment the flight attendants announced that they have snack buy option I had realised that I am not going to get real food here We booked with this airline so she would have had a day flight not a night flight First flight with Ethad Airways on a holiday trip to The Maldives flight out from London cabin crew not helpful seemed very uninterested with their passengers When we arrived back in Sydney his wheelchair was not at the plane to meet him as we had previously organised we even discussed with the crew during the flight to ensure the chic would be at the door of the plane the chair had been sent to oversized baggage so again not good enough A complete sham in the name of airline services Cannot understand why the pilots give long announcements in Arabic Very erratic service Either flight attendants have been trained NOT to smile at allalso no toiletries kit for long flight from bkk Auh vv as another airlines give for flight above 6 hours There must have been a vacant seat on the next day s flight for them to give me a seatI could not fault the service in any way This all might sound a bit harsh but that screaming bratt should have been controlled and the staff could have helpedCalling the service there was nothing he can do but sent an eMail to the check in In addition and due to the shortage in departure gates Etihad uses buses to transfer passengers from the terminal to the aircraft parking area very annoying and I have been calling and chasing speaking to many customer service agents that just pass me along from one person to the other sending emails andI emailed my frustration to the Executive Team this morning then Mr Marc or Marco called me back to state all the excuses with Policy and even he challenged a customer how to handle 10 000 inquiries a day And in flight entertainment couldn t be betterIt was a great flight except the entertainment my kids were cranky they wanted to watch other stuff on the tvthe seats are not so comfortable for long flight and appears to be congested but the fair is usually affordable Local emergency number did not respond but once meals were finished there wasn t much sign of any staff offering further drinks or snacksâ Not a great flight I then had to wait for 5hrs 55mins 2am 8am for the next flight request for water and alcoholic beverage for second time was never answered finally before landing the senior cabin lady came and in not a very friendly mannerBeing quite accustomed to long haul flights I usually get a bit of a doomed feeling as I board the plane knowing I won t be sleeping a wink on an overnight flight as I am quite tall We also missed our flight from LA to Seattle on Feb 9th and I was only able to get a small portion of those tickets credited for future flights Customer service is apparently herding and feeding you without much of a forced smile or effort After waiting to complete forms at Lost Luggage desk for over an hour I was informed my bag was in Sydney Australia would arrive on the next flight Staff from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was not friendly and accomodating YouFurthermore no response to emails and customer service does not have any clue 2 An air steward requested to charge his mobile phone using the USB in front of my son s seat even though there were many empty seats around probably so that he could keep an eye on his precious phone while flirting with the stewardesses at the back I have noticed the service is not as great as it used to be in the past Being economy class the seat just got uncomfortable on the long flights when I asked if I could use one I didn t mind paying a minimum charge the senior cabin staff instructed that we could take the seat at USD 90 apparently they charge more on board Etihad service is fairly standard for the better airlines Seats are maybe a bit thinner than some though legroom was ok in economy however on the return flight I could not believe how different the service was very poor but I had about as much space on an EasyJet flight as I did on this plane which isn t acceptable when the flight time and price are considerably more We have never experienced this on a long haul flight ever before If Etihad send you an email telling you that the time of your flight has been changed and that you can change your flight for free in the next 30 days DO NOT BELIEVE THEM Poor onboard service the flight attendants especially the men were so rude and not helpingI was hoping if anyone from Etihad customer service department can assist me in this as the baggage claim department is unresponsive and hotline I called in Singapore are unable to assist me in this matter Iâ m hoping our next flights maybe a little more service friendly The biggest flaw we experienced was the lack of water offered throughout the flight service on board and the food selection is not the best and on my return leg for Abu Dhabhi the air hostess was extremely unhelpful and appeared totally unhappy serving business class passengers Crew needs to serve each and every passenger in the same way because all of them are paid the money and booked economy class but crew only care about Europe passengers Flight boarding and take off were on time and landed at Abu Dhabi 15 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time If you query their inadequate response they will not give you contact details for senior customer service managers To be able to take the complaint further And Iâ m realistic enough to know that some people want to be left alone for 14 hours but customer satisfaction was definitely not high on the staff agenda The guy seemed to have no understanding that the aisle seats had been paid for and proceeded to tell me that only this flight you have a window seat next flight is aisle The inflight services quality of food and the interiors are sulking the least to say For the first time I experienced that the International crew that was flying from Delhi to Abu Dhabhi was not at all polite in the whole 3 nd half hourâ Weâ re hoping for the flights home we are â allocatedâ seats togetherService was not good Same tatty dated decor just with slightly bigger seats and potentially better serviceon may the 15th Etihad ground staff postpone the check in opening as they said for technical issue your staff offer me to stay in the lounge just for don t pay the hotel and transportFor a very long flight this was very uncomfortable The air conditioning was cold and it felt very cramped we are not actually trusted to have the inflight entertainment system working until 20 minutes or so after weâ ve taken off For example they no longer offer a turn down service of your bedReturn flight was missed due to an Etihad delay however as the newly scheduled flight was no more than 8 hours after I had originally booked to fly they were not obligated to offer any form of compensation I got out of my seat and went to the crew area and asked for one more drink if that s possible because your co worker said we re not serving right nowIt is the only airline I now that regularly boards the passengers one hour and 15 minutes before scheduled departure and is almost always late to depart Ticket prices do not justify the service Rudeness and inconsistency in policy are serious matters but the response by Marc in Customer Care was not satisfying at all When I realised that my seat was actually in a row of 3 with no extra legroom I went to find the air stewardess who just basically told me to find a manager myself she was too busy to sort it Can t faulty the service quality of food served and punctuality of the 4 flights I took on this return trip Very shoddy customer serviceThree weeks before departure tickets arrived only instead of direct flight to UAEIt s not my style to criticise a service but on this occasion I felt I had to sorry Our expectations from the best airline of Middle East were a let down Maybe I should get assistance next time but doubt if I would have made my next flight if I had to wait for help This airlines services very standard especially onboard services except they have wifi onboard pay It was not until I approached one of the ground staff and demanded to know what was going onIt was a full flight and no spare seats however despite that the seat comfort and space is ok for this long haul flight I pressed the service light for a drink waited 5 minutes and noticed the light had been switched off They said that we were a no show my wife mentioned that stand by staff ticket passengers go on last minute 10 15 minutes before take off and there was a moment of hesitation and the ground staff asked if we were staff I have travelled Premium Economy with Virgin to the USA and that service was so far more superior to the lousy service in Etihad Business ClassPrice certainly didn t convert in to a lesser service or comfort Every once in a while you see a grumpy disgruntled or unprofessional flight attendant Crew on this April 3 flight EY 234 was not even welcoming on arrival Staff not very interested neither were the admin If I had to complain about anything it is the comfort of the seating but all aircraft of this kind are the same in economy classIt seems to me that Etihad in a bid to reduce operating costs have cut back on staff training and all forms of in flight entertainment The service was not very good Zero baggage issues zero delays flight from Syndey Abu Dhabi to Rome was relatively underbooked and so were encouraged by airline stewards to enjoy some extra room and spread out across any empty rows plenty of in flight entertainment decent onboard toilets I had never been to Australia before and there were lots of flights and airlines to choose from have made purchased for seat selection but I have to change my flight schedule and paying extra enormous additional payment for this reschedule and they are not allowing me to carry the seat selection that I have purchased before instead they are asking for extra payment on new seat selection saying the payment made on the seat selection before cannot be carried forward neither refund Flight service is not the one to rave about neither is the food but all is quite acceptable Especially for so many first time flyers and people coming from a hot country how were they going to be comfortable in a freezing plane for 5 hours at night I am so disappointed I have handed over good money for a service that they have just decided they can no longer affordThe air stewardess gave me the most disinterested look and proceeded to shout over me and across the passengers in my row to an air steward do you have and chicken a vegetables left Not much room for international flight Service forgets to serve breakfast The Chicago connection can sometimes be so long there are no staff at the check in to issue a follow on intl boarding pass for hours Last but not least they switch on the inflight entertainment system only after 20 mins after take off and not on the ground while on the apron and switch off as soon as the pilot announces descent Please read my negative review of our return flight from Narita to AbuDhabi aboard Flight 871 Unrecognizable Not even poor cafeteria standard However the luggage allowances and flight times are an area begging improvement The staff were not very friendly or helpful We received flight schedule changed email which did not mention the flight was going to change to 77W At first I thought this was probably because it seemed like a mid size plane to me but the seat and legroom conditions did not improve in the seemingly bigger return flight either I didnâ t understand there was another lady who was also travelling solo having the same connection told the same we both were given options that either we can take the 22 00 Mumbai flight and go to Bangalore from there which will delay our journey by 5 to 7 hours or can take a direct flight to Bangalore from Abu Dhabi the next day Afternoon when I asked why in first place I am being denied a seat and why I was not informed about this in ZurichBut flights to south asia is always jammed and service is average and also the planes in these routes are not so comfortable As an airline industry employee I understand that itâ s not normal to have half loaded aircraft but as a passenger I have really enjoyed economy class on all my destinations And the Dreamliner for the long haul flights only three seats across all sections Air Hostess were not responsive on calling After invoking the services of the maintenance men who grumpily ripped the seat apart and played with the motors and cushioning staff advised that nothing could be done One breakfast was simply a wrap which was a snack not a meal which is below standard for a long haul flight Not an experience I would consider in future flights the service on the plane was average as if the crew did not want to beâ The check in time at Brisbane was over an hour standing in line could have opened more desks if staff were available againThey have no idea of triaging passengers We didnâ t see any crew after that throughout the whole flight they did not come round again to offer drinks until an hour before landing and it was almost an 8 hour flight 4 Cabin crew don t know how to organize and don t attend to calls The lost baggage desk informed us that the bags were in Abu Dhabi and given the itinerary of our trip and the contact details of the safari company promised that out bags would be delivered en route after 48 hours Only all flights the Flight Attendants have been exceptional excellent customer service friendly and nothing too much trouble for them Rating 2 Toilet clean but amenities like lotion mouthwash or toothbrush rating 2 Seats has reasonable legroom but cushions are not comfortable for long flights rating 2 Soon after take off the cabin crew darkened the window shades indicating they were encouraging passengers to sleep during the day time flight Etihad airline incompetence n lousy service I boarded etihad airline flight 470 on 9 July 2018 flying from abu Dubai back to SingaporeThis airline take no responsibility and do not have ANY CUSTOMER service The steward taking care of our section a heavily made up young man could barely conceal his contempt for the passengers and served our meals in a rushed abrupt manner The flight attendants were not so attentive and friendly Other than that decent airline and flights would use again at similar price On the ground however Etihad no longer offers choufer service to Business class travelers Compared to Qatar Emirates and Air India food quality and quantity also not good Etihad had a direct flight to New York that was leaving about the same time as our scheduled departure When I asked the Crew for something else This was un edible she looked at me and said No we don t have anything and walked away Chose this particular airline because it was the cheapest non budget option available but only by about 300 The flight attendants were for the most part rude surly and unavailable In the usual place of work every staff member should tolerate thisCabin crew with serious attitude on a one shift 7 hour journey with the main focus on making an all day flight into a night flight by turning the windows into blackout mode It seems that Etihad customers are paying for their failed investments in other airlines not to mention the bank rolling of the Manchester City team However for longer flights its very cramped and the new seats are not very comfortable The service is average not much of food choices We do not believe your customer service team will respond to our needs and is incapable of returning our possessions so I had to wait until 24 hours before departure of my connecting flight Secondly the two members of staff NEVER stopped talking throughout the whole 4 hour journey to each other the staff on the flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney on 28 6 18 were the exception they all made everyone feel as though no request was too difficult kudos to them Etihad customer relations seems to regard its customers with as much contempt as some of its flight attendants Seats a little cramped for such a long flight When we arrived at Edinburgh airport no knew about the passenger assistance so we had to walk through the airport after being told it would be organised for us in Abu Dhabi I informed Flight attendants who could not fix it I believe flight company do not have the power to simply change their passenger tickets without consent Not permitted to move to empty seats staff unfriendly never smiled We found the staff no different than in economy as far as service was concerned Here is why Etihad has smaller legroom ares no food choice serving our seats as the last one with only one meal choice out of three at the beginning very slow check in not the best in flight entertainment all flights were delayed multi stop flight One meal served after leaving Abu Dhabi then nothing for 10 hours Unfriendly staff but unlike BA no crew were insight to point out exits etc When we made it through immigration we finally found the counter to fill out the delayed luggage paperwork and after filling it out we were told â oh by the way you wonâ t make your next flight because you have to be there 45 minutes prior and itâ s in another terminal â For the money I paid and even though I was only flying economy I expect a much better standard of service One of my fellow passenger slept when they were serving the food when she got up in about an hour or so she was hungry but the hostess told her quite clearly that nothing is available and we are finished with food The flight started well champagne and nuts served on boarding and my dinner menu taken that was the end of any service for the next 3 5 hours no offer of any drinks water and no sign of any food We did 12 flights and this is the only airline that chose not to get it rightIn flight entertainment the touch screen was extremely unresponsive and inaccurate there wasn t a lot to choose from in terms of movies or TV shows The other thing i really didn t understand was that all the pilots didn t put they system active until we were well up in the air and turned t off before we stated to prepare to land I haven t experienced that with any other airline Weâ ve had delayed bags flights before with Korean Airlines and the reason why we will be going back to them rather than trying Etihad again is because of the tremendous customer service they provided when dealing with these issues The air had a better humidity level than usual Worse though was the generally surly and uncooperative attitude of the staff There were no special careNot customer focused But after that no service at all When we retrieved our new suitcase after our home flight â All services both on board food and care and online poor website no link to sisters companies booking checking are under average and not representative of a 21st century airline company NO ONE CARES my mother needed wheel chair assistance and they were helpful professional and took us straight to our gate not one entertainment system worked properly Chaotic check in inconsistent inflight service and discrepancy between baggage policy and baggage implementation they be have low cost for a high privÃ no choicee of seats no choice of meal seat distance in 777 too small no european rights of passengersOn boarding the next flight to Entebbe i was upgraded to business class and this served as the best compensation to the several hours I had spent wait I have since written to baggage claims and to feedback at Etihad but NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING FROM EITHER DEPARTMENT why canâ t a airline staff assist me in getting it or at least call the other desk and inform them ahead and give the PNR to keep it ready when I arrive but it was not great service We all enjoyed the In flight entertainment no free wifi though Having flown lots of the major airlines we chose Etihad for this trip as we hadn t flown with them before My question 1 why should the passenger go through an ordeal for no fault of the passenger if the flight is overbooked To add insult to injury cabin crew came up to me saying here is your Kosher meal again not ordered by me In terms of the flight I must have flown about 20 times with Etihad in last 2 years and donâ t recall any significant delays Maintained aircraft with amenities but service in the air is not up to that standard The service on the A380 had been declining with not enough staff on the upper deckAir Hostess was not aware of this and politely told me that I am not supposed to carry two hand luggage Whilst I know there are many types of business class traveller I believe a sense of warmth was lacking with the service from Etihad The flight being full was not appropriately handled by the crewthe us mere mortals spending 4x the amount as the friends and family bonus gets priority over full paying customers Having arrived 4 hours prior to the departure of my flight and having checked in on line 24 hours what I thought would be a nice relaxing time to spend in the duty free and to simply rest before my long flight turned into a nightmare When I asked what type of fish was served I was told by an air hostess she did not know The A330 is not a great aircraft for long haul flights Perth Abu Dhabi is 11hours with lower legroom less comfortable seats smaller TV screens and greater engine noise The system was not allowing us to change the seat and the ground service at the Abu Dhabi Airport was not able to help us Their customer service agent are only their to occupy seatsHowever when it comes to consistency and the quality of the flight there are fluctuations for example flights to Middle Eastern countries do lack in quality the food sometimes in need of dire help Similar experience on Abu Dhabi to Manchester leg had problems with seatback screen so could not watch movies when called cabin crew took ages to respond and only on the fifth call was I told that the problem could not be fixed After this had been resolved we never received an apology from the flight attendant for this accusation As my flight started in Rome I had the first leg with Alitalia DO NOT recommend it at all Unfriendly staff dinner terrible choice tasted awful it doesn t start until you are at cruising altitude and turns off upon decent it s a little bit barbaric and unfortunately my screen did not work for the flight not that the air crew made any attempt to fix that too without any in flight entertainment 3 Flight attendants don t bother to come to ur seat when press the help button The flight attendants don t care about providing a service Airline staff and the ground staff could not proactively help or assist on time when there was a delay at their end in operating the flight If a 240 change of schedule fee was applied then I should not have had to pay more for the next day s flight There were three of us and naturally we would have loved to sit together unfortunately the flight design is not the normal one Economy in most airlines is pretty much the same though I have to say the service in Etihad is pretty perfunctory That particular waiting lounge was very big catered for many different boarding gates ours gate 47 you really couldnâ t tell those sitting infront of the boarding gate are actually passengers of that gate I get due to a lack of care from the cabin crew when transiting up and down the isle Flights are always so full you can t get enough space for your bag in the overhead department if you are not first in I use to travel with Etihad since 8 years and I have the quality of services declining declining Flight time changed to 6pm from 10pm then since we are arriving at 1am there stopped giving out amenity bags Firstly the seats in the business class offer much required comfort on a long flight Service was pretty good on most of the flights though one or two of the cabin crew were a bit offhand when I asked for a coffee outside of the normal service time Service has drastically changed over the last year So stringent about weight food servicesThe cabin crew were less than helpful There is a disconnect between the ground teams and we are in receipt of different messages regarding the status of her baggage and cannot get a straight answer Two air hostess were actually having a smirk on their face when a passenger asked for an apple juice twice Everything about their service be it food in flight entertainment comfort is just so average Bangkok airways despite being a small regional airline at least managed to offer its customers decent food a good phad thai on what was only a 1 hour flight Service on the flight was efficient food not too thrilling butCould you at least hand in a printed paper or instruct your check in crew to verbally inform customers that only paying the fee doesn t solve the issue and that you might lose your reserved seats incase of name change so that at least i can connect to the wifi at the business lounge and RE reserve my seats for the flight back home if your staff are NOT ALLOWED TO DOFirstly beyond the first order for food and a drink within the first few minutes of the flight nothing else was offered First the staff are completely un trained going through a 16 hour flight with 2 3 cabin crew elbowing me as they walk is a big pain It all starts with the Etihad Airways Chauffeur Pick Up Drop Off their lounge access their state of the art aircrafts friendly member of staff in flight and on the ground I told the customer service that I was not happy with voucher and ask them to find me a seat in any other airline to flyout that day There was a mix up with online leg room system and airline contacted me advising that they would refund the original payment re do the online extra legroom booking which I paid for again Just about got settled when the cabin crew came round with the well still frozen sandwiches In general the crew don t make the initiative to ask you if you would like anything not even on a 13 hours flights Etihad while being an airline that I have come to rely on for exceptional levels of quality service is very much now languishing in those stakes Seats were smaller than other flights Iâ ve done but it was not a full flight so was able to spread out over all 8 10The entertainment service was not to bad but compared to other airlines in the region it is a bit lacking Overall the flight attendants were unpleasant Nasty junk food Broken seats Malfunction of entertainment Back seat storage pockets dirty Non sense air conditioningI am currently experiencing some very dodgy sales and customer service issues with an upcoming business class booking to Europe This year I noticed a tremendous decline in service with the airline Cabin crew couldn t care less Some meals were cold others inedible and once mine was delivered with no plastic cutlery had to wait for a long time and crew member thought funny as he handed out to other people too Have travelled with this airline many times and cant complain on the price or service However on this occasion it seemed the aircraft was a little dated and a bit cramped they weighed our hand baggage at the gate and charged us 300 each for my family of 4 as all our cabin baggage was much below all world airline standard but 1 cm longer than Etihad s 50 cmâ Crew lacked the professionalism and finesse of Emiratesâ I contacted the service no answer The seats are spacious and the cabin crew cannot do enough for you Decided to use American Airlines mileage to travel to Abu Dhabi and this was truly worst flight albeit of having travelled over 3 million miles globally As an executive platinum on AA you still get no benefit like on other one world alliance partners no check in options or boarding preference Food options were vegetarian only for 2 of the 3 meals as flight attendant told us itâ s now airline standard for this flight sandwich offered had some green vegy that was inedible Food onboard was acceptable however given that the flight cost was comparable with Emirates whom weâ ve flown with on a number of occasions the comfort leg room cabin crew and overall flight was nowhere near as good particularly on long haul it was old plane not welcoming staff Around 20 mins before departure of our flight we walked up to our gate only to be told that the gate is closed Cons The entertainment system is off until the plane is on the air The aircraft had the same entertainment system as the 1st flight and again our main meal was served before the rest of the flight Met all my expectations and more from check in to boarding was seamless onboard service was on point In fact one of my team mates flew out with Etihad on a flight after me later the same day and had no issue I put this like it is due to the lack of service we received and questions going round and round in circles the flight On board the flight crew were not remotely friendly in fact we did not even know there was a â Nannyâ on board Not very much impressed by the cabin services For an airline headquartered in a culture that requires much water in connection with personal hygiene there does not seem to be any designated staff responsible for doing maintenance in the lavatories which differs markedly from superior airlines like Qatar that recognizes the need for that Right from the counter to collect boarding pass till the end of journey the staffs were prude judgemental made sarcastic comments They are a bit of a bus in the air really not flash but not bad either From there the service of DHL was quite fast Flight entertainment was up to date with its movies etc I wrote Etihad asking why there were no ground service staff to assist us considering the inconvenience of boarding deplaning with luggage I frequently travel using this service and most times the flights are delayed either on departure or on connection atLimited flights that goes direct to HKT as for the service etihad is really doing bad although am a gold member in their program but the way they deal with their customers is not appropriate and the stuff is working as if someone is forcing them to do so We were then demanded by a flight attendant to provide our boarding passes to ensure we were in the correct seats as another passenger had requested the row to themselves and was unhappy that we were there in our assigned seats While checking in we requested to check out baggage direct to Montreal but the counter staff advised it is not possible and checked the baggage only up to Toronto I was etihad silver member but their services start to decline on every trip and it was a horrible flight home after having an amazing holiday in Paris My only challenge was I could not hear the voice of the lady making announcements after the Captain Pilot s skills were second to none and I was stuck in Hyderabad for more than 20 hours stayed up all night and no sleep no rest as the original flight departure time is 4 45AMRegular flight with no surprises It would have been difficult to fly with a 3 year old infant if there were no nanny service on board Totally apathetic attitude of the airlines Considering no chauffer service average above average service levels Etihad is no competition for Qatar Airways but was much better than my last Emirates experience when we landed in Abu Dhabi rather that being able to rest before the long flight we spent 5 hours in cues arguing haggling fighting for the seats we had already paid for Cabin crew were not friendly except for one lady some feed back about air port inconvenience to be given We felt that the in flight staff should have offloaded these passengers at Zurich itself and helped the flight to take off on time The marketing of the Airline offers a perception of a cut above others we found it pretty poor in all areas check in pretty slow legroom very tight seats uncomfortable lots of screens not working As a result the air hostesses took my hand luggage pieces and put them in spaces available leading to them being spread out down my aisle The service onboard the long haul flights was great however on the international flights to and from the Maldives the service was poor that were right next to me for the whole 4hr night flight nor did the cabin crew make any attempt to help settle them seat stuffing uncomfortable hostess service not good compare with previous flight I can not speak highly enough of the service I have received on multiple occasions when travelling in Business Class with Etihad and they used the excuse traffic incident however not the case more laziness and tried filling plane up then from abu dhabi same thing and unprofessional staff that had no idea about the oxygenI made my way to the Lounge for my next flight to Dublin When the customer pays the full price of the ticket they expect some good behavior from the crew ground staff and expect good services And less services onboard can be feel They rescheduled us on different flights without giving us options noâ Well first time was so disappointing starting from the check in process ending with their cabin crew and on board horrible services Avoid at all costs as they were once excellent till they placed profits before passengers and most concerning is not 1 person who works for them likes the C E O or there own management that tells me a lot when there own staff admit to that along with ongoing mechanical issues in flight but do not tell passengers The Abu Dhabi Mumbai Abu Dhabi is passable and the service on that sector is also the same plus the terminal in Abu Dhabi where we took the Mumbai flight was not looked after well with smelly unclean toilets Since we had a connection from Abu Dhabi at 8 45 am we knew we were going to miss it but what we hadn t bargained for was that we would have to now spend the entire day and night at Abu Dhabi airport as the next flight was at 8 45 am the following day and that we would be given no hotel room to rest our exhausted selves in Absolutely no ground services in MunichThe lady Inflight supervisor had harsh demeanour and and none of the crew would qualify even for pleasant personality contest I have next flight on Friday May 25th from Abu Dhabi to KHI and decided not to take Etihad any more the airline will be responsible in case something happens because of the non availability of my medicine fancy buildings and expensive planes doesn t make a good airline it s about attitude and quality of service IF Etihad wish to claim the title of National Airline of the UAE then there needs to be a major review of its service standards Not one time did the quality of service diminish But then I received an answer from the customer care that they don t have a provision to refund me the cancellation feesThe in flight entertainment was very limited seems petty to whinge when I remember the drop down screens showing the movie but I am comparing with other airlines The trouble is that we are not going to do a long haul flight within the next year Part of the crew was unfriendly and looked rather annoyed Etihad Business Class lounge at Abu Dhabi at around 7 00 AM local time was packed with virtually no place to sit I wanted to change the date of my return flight having booked a non amendable fair I was expecting to pay Lastly was the cabin crew service while serving they were talking rather loudly among themselves disturbing quite a few sleeping passengers The latest trip Bangkok from Manchester was mediocre on so many levels the planes 777 s were old and looking worn out the food was truly inedible the inflight entertainment system needs updating more often No response after 1 month so I contacted the area manager againI could not have caught our next flight without it Not happy with their wheelchair accessible service Disgraceful service from Etihad the staff were rude and obnoxious failed to give me the correct allocated seat that I requested through the app when checking in and a complete lack of safety when the plane landed in Abu Dhabi for the layover a box from the galleyâ I will not talk about the lack of passengers hoses instead of the buses No info temperature at 28 degrees no service I just wanted to enjoy Ã very minute of my flight onboard service is the standard economy class type of service Service wasn t as good as the Melbourne Abu Dhabi leg We have never come across this before normally when flight time are changed the seats reserved remain the same No customer serviceUnfriendly staff The majority of the airline crew appeared unable to smile but unfortunately thereâ s an aircraft changes which i flew with Airbus 330I demonstrated to the air stewardess Olga that I do not fit in the standard seat 18H and as suchPilot advised they can t land in Sydney until after 6 30 am flight was only going to take 13 hours instead of the scheduled 14 hours Most of the crew seemed unhappy to be there unprofessional staff and theyMy wife and I booked 2 seats in second last row of a 777 as the aisle was wider not constantly bumped by crew and passengers moving about and only 2 seats on the sides rather than the usual 3 drinks service abysmal and apathetic cabin crew intolerable and lousy at their job do not come when summoned it s their jobReturn flight to Bris was very uncomfortable no room to move unfriendly staff and their answer is you should have read their guidelines in detail and that their staff is not responsible for knowing this There was not as much beverage service as the first leg but was probably because of the timing The ground crew were unfriendly and unprofessional the cabin crew were even worse rude bad attitude unable to smile and extremely unfriendly finally after 30 mns after start of service the cabin crew informed me that my food was wrongly given to another passenger and now all Hindu meals are exhausted At this price no other airline offers the same service so one will have to put up with the long layovers on long haul flights On checking in at Manchester they allocated me different seats due to a change of aircraft which sounded a limp excuse We had a family sitting opposite us with a young baby and was not given a seat belt for the child not good enough staff not efficient not good at all From Dub Abu Dhabi none of the entertainment systems worked for the duration not ideal with 2 kids The Cabin crew Female serving our seats who is very rude no smiling face After several attempts for 25 minutes we had no choice but to try and get a last minute taxi to get us to the airport which resulted in us being late and just about made boarding resulting in no use of the lounge which is part of what you pay for when you fly business Having flown with Etihad for at least twice a year for over 10 years I can really see how they have slipped in their delivery of what was once a first class service no matter the class you traveled in My advice to Economy passengers thinking of treating yourself dont bother or change to a different airline I thought the quality of service and seat comfort would be the same sadly I was mistaken Emirates offers more space better inflight entertainment and meal service plus other touches like a hot flannel Weâ ve flown a number of international flights with 2 children under 8 and none so far have been as interested or attentive to our children as the staff on ourâ We had a very pleasant flight half empty on the way out and as soon as the door closed everyone ran to the middle rows and lay down Frustrated of course we questioned the staffs whether did they page for us and how did any flight attendant speak to me or even acknowledge my presence and I will NEVER fly with Etihad again The service cannot be faulted The service on board from London to Abu Dhabi was OK 1st thing I noticed was they had stopped theâ but we fly a lot and have never met such an unfriendly everything is too much hassle crew Cannot understand how it was over Crew not friendly and not cooperativeGenerally long flights are not enjoyable it was a long flight in relatively comfy seats the food was OK not fantastic but certainly not bad However it seems that traveling from Munich is not an interesting spot for Etihad Airways old airplanes in and out of Munich do not make it an exceptional service experience It is a 13 14h flight from JFK in New York to Abu Dhabi but it does not seem as long with the Etihad entertainment system and the service When we arrived at the lounge a staff member came and took our details and informed us he would return when check in opened and take us there No more chauffeur drive staff not as attentive wine selection not great and although the stand alone bed in first is long and wide enough you cant control it as it is a slide out bench so only config is totally flat There was totally nothing awful about my experience but by the same token absolutely nothing impressive very tight seating very unremarkable food staff were pleasant enough On other flights the staff came round with drinks and fruit etc throughout the time in the air but not on either of these flights The actions of the airline shows that it has no care for or empathy with its customers and so I would recommend that you do not fly with them Sadly I could see the significant decline in all services Flight attendant was also not able to help Not a bad airlineThe service was exceptional on Etihad I require gluten free food and the cabin crew could not so enough to ensure my food was free of gluten but still tasty Flew out to HCMC in economy class flight attendants very friendly but service was average the food was extremely poor Never disappointing the staff onboard is keen to assist customers and never disgruntled when asked a question or favor Between passengers who seemingly forgot to pre order a Veg option and then became irate when there were none left to cabin crew who didn t seem to know how to handle it holding up service to the rest of the flight â The cabin crew were unfriendly and not very helpful the food Wes acceptable but unfortunately the cabin crew were a little overworked and didnâ t really have a lot of time for the passengers Even with a small delay in departure the staff did everything they could to help I am a platinum frequent flyer with Etihad and I never had the chance to write a general review in their service Crew were not providing enough drinks and we were getting very dehydrated Our seats were toward the back the aircraft something that should not impact the service provided Also do not be fooled by the â luxuriousâ lure of this airline the aircrafts are old ugly and uncomfortable The crew here looked very cold were very indifferent with the guests were busy with their work and did not seem to care Contrary to the practice in some of the carrier which stock snacks at certain locations for passengers to help themselves in long flights Emirates had none I was not feeling well and needed to have access to the bathroom staff helped me move and ensured I was okay during the flight Cabin crews not approachable did not have the choice of meal meal was just handed over without even explaining the content Ground staff at Kolkata were not as much forthcoming and the only option we had was to keep checking the pretty rudimentary Departures TV screen It was not a big deal but its all about the services one airline provides to its customers and sometimes its necessity I forgot to pick my earplugs and thought that I should be provided with the plugs on board I have sinuses issue and really need to use plugs believe me as soon as I landed in London I ordered earplugs from Amazon This was made up of a 500 no show fee on my booked flight a 240 change of flight fee and a 598 additional ticket cost for the new flight Next the cabin crews never give any kind of preference or care for infants Etihad does not display any hospitality customer service or appreciation for its guests Negatives Food quality quantity Attitude service of cabin crews Online check in option is complicated Between 24 48 hours prior to departure paid seats need to be booked â How can any other airline in the world let a Business Class passenger wait for luggage at the belt for more than an hour No customer service or interaction Lack of basic information to help any one Onboard crews never fail to provide your needs In truth I had only travelled business class once before so the experience itself probably colours my view of the flight a little As part of the BC experience there was no chauffeur service offered by the airline especially in SA This person pass me with the manager I have to wait as she is talking with other passengers I don t understand why everyone is so tense crew and passengersIt was also odd the flight attendant had to check if there was enough soup onboardand then you get a small Jet air flight to New delhi which is not at all comfortable Re My last review on June 3 and the total irresponsive attitude to my emails and direct twit with no responsible action by Etihad management let s see if providing my case 602657 will result in some professional real customer centric responseMost handed back untouched manchester to Abu dhabi first leg crew surly clearly out of sortsThe cabin bag I have travelled with on multiple international air lines didnâ t seem to meet their expectations even though it was well under the allowed weight It always was not a priority route with not best planes If you consider an airline that did not even making it into the top 100 airlines of the world an eqal partner airline to you worth the same money I will treat you as such Should not the airline have informed my travel agent that without a transit visa on my passport prior to arrival I would not be able to make use of the airlineâ s offer of a hotel room overnight so when I discovered at the beginning of a 13 hour flight that my VDU was knackered the cabin crew swapped me with the staffer Onboard service is similarly insufficient I am Indian myself but it is obvious that they have been given next to no training in customer service and come across as disinterested at best Cabin crew need to up their game as far as customer engagement goes seemed bored little by way of eye contact or personal contact skills The flight was unremarkable but once again the crew were unfriendly food was uninspiring and entertainment options limited and cut off prior to landingWe have two trips planned next year and will return to our usual airline where Business Class is just that a Business Class service had super late night flight around 4 in the morning No pleasant service from the surley crew who appeared annoyed when walking to the galley for exercise Etihad is not just one of the most luxurious and customer oriented air carrier on the market this is not simply a company that stretches out through half of the globe Overall mediocre services despite good intentions and effort Etihad completely evaded the question and offered instead a link where one can get meet and greet service for US 105 Then when no ongoing flight was available for us the male counter attendants didnt give a toss sending us away from the counter with a meal voucher TWICE Less leg room than the average 737 food tasteless except for the raw apple and cabin crew all but disappeared apart from when serving meals or selling duty free I have called out corporate travel service who booked the ticket and they have no one they can follow up with The pilots on both of our flights communicated really well even apologising for an 8min delay caused by rerouting by air traffic control Nothing offered service wise until 2 hours inflight meals are the hot dish a dry bread andLet me begin with my and many others travel disruption with this airline was the equivalent to 24 hours with very little warning ahead of time for what we were told was because of a change in the type of aircraft scheduled to operate this service While the cabin crew appears experienced and truly international for some inexplicable reason they do not seem to be well organized coordinated or functioning a s team Crew what you say does not make any sense On the flights from and to Frankfurt and from Abu Dhabi to Ho Chi Minh we did not receive any amenities and no special attention or small gift for our toddler which many other airliners do I cannot completely blame other crew members on board who provided better service If you want to watch movies and the like from the moment you sit in your seat take another airline who are more customer focused Air hostess hits baby head with trolley baby crying air hostess wonâ t apologise I have contacted Guest relations via email and phone on more than 3 occasions and they still cannot allocate my miles for this trip and also no staff member can help on my little refund of 100 in the Travel Bank they don t know where this bank is My experience with Etihad is the service is inconsistent at best and to expect little Crew after 10 minutes of processing the entry onto the system my system has stopped working so you can take it with you but this is the last time you ever do it I paid for the wi fi while flying and worked perfectly during the first flight MAD AUH I flied to US and return for 15hrs and the plane was old and seats not comfirtable at all and served us with only 2 meals that s it The cabin crew were not friendly and happy at all But had not a good attitude from airline crew means could have been good asked for a specific beer they were serving and just blindly given one which she got in her hand like that if you want you drink they stored it overhead the seat did not recline and the media player did not work i wear a body medical cam that takes my bp oxygen levels heart rate and films the surroundings i am in Etihad took 3 weeks to cover up there big mistakes of not giving me oxygen and lied about it to cover themselves up however the ATSB has seen the vision of there unprofessional staff also the crew and pilots in Athens turned up 40 minutes latei want EY 313 on 05 Oct 2018 agent book for me EY 311 on 05 Oct the super visor on connect canter etihad he change flight free this is not enough i want compensation for this error While the crew both on ground and in the air were competent it was the airlineâ s attitude that stood out like a sore thumb Their service is i dont care attitude their meals are now consistently poor and when there is a delay we missed our connecting flight although there was still half an hour to go for over 15 hours Try to stay away from booking on this airline i booked the flight from abudhabi to atlanta and they provided a shuttle service from dubai to abudhabi this service is not accurate at all as well as their staff is very rude and not well behaved The Check In Procedure could be better with faster service what Jet Airways would complete in 15mins Etihad took 30mins I felt refreshed and had a glass of champagne before boarding my next flight I fly Etihad often and find their service good and haven t had any problems in the dozen years that I have been using EtihadThe Ethiad staff wouldn t help us in this regard either Not a good flight to take from Amsterdam as its a connecting flight for most of the East bound destinations First check in was very slow performed by a training staff I pre ordered a gluten free meal but my dinner on the first flight and lunch on my connecting flight were the same I spoke to their costumer service and they didn t have any other option After asking the crew was able to give a caramel biscuit to my son which wasn t really his choice Service quality online check in seating with my family were disappointing Cabin service was a little better From the limo picking us up and dropping us at the airport to the first class service upon arrival to the business class lounge the staff Husbands chair was very wobbly food ok I reviewed in the past this carrier finding no value in Etihad since when competion has levelled pricing services aircraft standards and so forth Staff very condescendingly responds you will still have the space for the baby in front of youLittle things the airline used to provide to make a difference and differentiate themselves is no longer the case After another couple of month when I traveled again they have not started the check in service yet nor any office facility The service was perfunctory and lacked any effort at customer engagement After lots of recent cuts with Etihad No chauffeur no pjs no toiletry pack in economy lounge food no longer a la carte and drinks at bar not table service Poor the entertainment was not much better very basic seat comfort to tight and uncomfortable loading of the aircraft at Abu DhabiGreat airline with not much to fault this airline was far better in the previous years service changed a lot into negative experience To make the story short now after many months of this trip the best way if a passenger experience a excess baggage is to open your baggage and see what you really don t need in my case now thinking back I did not need bunch of stuff in my baggage that I could of thrown them away and avoided the charge such as shampoo after shave body wash soup etc and customer choice was not an option NOT A POLICYAir travel over long distances is definitely not for me I have flown with emirates thai PIA and other airlines but never experienced this kind of service I have used this airline since it started its service from Ireland The overall onboard service is good but it has lost its touch The seats were also extremely uncomfortable On the upside the food was fine as was the the service Letâ s just say it is not Emirates the class of service was mediocre at best the seat of the planeI was given three choices and opted for the next direct flight rather than the quickest via Mumbai or the same flight 24 hours later too late given that I needed to go to work Cabin crew could not be more helpful This is my first time flying with Eithad Airways and booked my flights with you under the impression that your company is one of the best only to be let down badly Food was actually pretty good too for an airline clearly difficult to match up meals to time zones on different flightsI file a complaint with Etihad ref 672615 and the customer supportIt seemed like asking for an additional non alcoholic drink was a chore and they couldnâ t be bothered this aspect of the flight was better on the return journey Bit underwhelming for my first flight on the new aircraft on the long first leg out of Brisbane seats felt smaller than other aircraft I have used on this leg The service was a bit better the food just as uninspiring as on the way out and the packaging was a smorgasbord of unrecyclable black plastic trays with plastic film lids other than a few staff coming over to announce soon to depart flights and to rush passengers of these flights there were only very few staff there to help to solve and calm the situation However option to take one bag into the jet means that all overhead departments will be full with huge suitcases of one part of pasengers who came earlier and was lucky to occupate their andâ The airplane was really old and needed to be refurbished the staff was okay there was not a great choice of entertainement on board Most of the staff I would not describe as rude just kind of the best way to put it would be room temperature My wife is a wheelchair case and compared to other airlines Etihad beats them hand over fist in service and pleasantness However do NOT make your bookings through Virgin Australia as we did or through flight agents No service was provided From starting my day in the Dublin lounge onwards the staff went out of their way I bought it from Etihad Etihad chose to use a low fare inefficient airline like Nas it s Etihad responsibility to bear the costs of their mistakes no answer after that from the said customer service s I don t know why eithad air ways is considered as one of the best air line Nice company but the service the meals beverages on board very poor compare to other airlines Spending 12 hours or more overnight in a departure lounge isn t my idea of good customer service However on our next journey in February we are travelling with a different Airline simply because Etihad are much dearer and will not match prices just merely a main course served on a tiny round tray a bun this is the worst meal I ever given by an airlines if I am paying low cost carrier airfare I would think is alright as is budget but is a no no for Etihad been the national carrier of UAE I would expect their inflight service will surpassed their rival Emirates but I am totally wrong in this aspect thats finished now The A380 is a very smooth quiet trip however the on board service and food is nowhere near as good as it used to be The staff are disinterested in talking to you or making your journey any more pleasant perhaps the company s treatment of them is similar to economy class passengers Upon arrival there were no staff anywhere directing welcoming patrons to the correct queues because you couldnâ t see the small pieces of paperin reading the other reviews on this site for Etihad it might not come as a surprise that i am following tend with a negative review of this airline On the day of their departure they had an 8 hour morning flight from Dublin airport to Abu dhabi where there was a layover of 2 hours before another 3 hour flight to Mumbai due to arrive at 3and it would have been good to have a written menu to look it over beforehand as te meals were not explained well by the staff eg one mealThe service was really average unfortunately the aircraft was far from being new which was making this tripâ Food is good and the service is secnd to none The First Business Class lounge in Sydney was small and not worth really lingering in Cabin Crew this was worst part about the flight Cabin crew didnt look too happy with their job and they had poor attitude I found that aspect missing and the occasional smile from a crew member wouldn t hurt This was a good flight on the whole with no major complaints new aircraft new things always travelled with emirates 380 so found it a little different seatings arrangements facing in opposite directions bar locations in flight entertainment but had a good flight and have no problemsâ What was funny was when a confused looking attendant tried to present me with a kids meal and realized I m in my mid 30s and sporting a beard The staff were either excellent or couldn t care less Not good Service I ever Travel They always take a little extra care of the customers to ensure we have a good time and do not experience any hassles during the journey In the airplane we were seated on the last row and we didn t get good rest because of the loud flushing sound coming from the toilet intermittently and that the crew hung around at the back and chatted loudly among themselves during most of the journey This strategy can be also felt through the crew attitude that looks pretty demotivated and lost their smile But it was a good flight good service from a hard working crew flight was bumpyBusiness Class Lounges were conveniently located with good service As a first time flyer to an international destination I really have nothing to compare it to I honestly can t measure it against another experience As a frequent international traveller I always try to fly Etihad for those who haven t experienced the excellent 5star service of a middle eastern airline this is not to be missed The in flight entertainment was really good the seats quite uncomfortable with very little room compared to BA 380 Positive of the flight took off 15 min before and arrived 45 min before the scheduled time LHR to AUH was an A380 with tired interiors but good service Far to cold in the cabin not a very good service and food was average at best No follow service or an extra glass of wine etc Crew were good food was a bit hit and miss The aircraft was good and the general layout was fine but the crew were lacklustre at best and did not seem to be interested in customer service at all The staff were really good nothing too much trouble Only had one stewardess who seemed to have been having a not so good time but overall it was still a great flight as always Service was good except the last hours were spoiled by the person behind me being drunk not these really nice customer service that is and I am an airways member and then they charged me for a neighbour seat on the way back because i would not pay for reserved seats things to work on some of the stewards were as miserable as sin and need to learn to smile but I didn t think the service was as good as it could have been the food not worth talking about the staff were lovely Had a wonderful service only downsize was no free Wi Fi The service was pathetic the steward spilt water on me while serving to the other side these things happen but did not even apologise he claimed that it wasn t him would it rain inside a flight The cabin crew was acting as they were the customers The meal service was poor out of the 2 toilets at the back one was locked all the time The behaviour of the staff was really really rude Never travel in bussines class Bad service Truly it is to be avoided by the end of the flight the toilets were unusable andI tried to reason with them that the US government takes security seriously and that they issued my new passport drivers license social security card etc only after verifying everything No responsibility of anything and worst customer service ever seen WORST AIRLINES EVER the flight was avoiding pak air space for few weeks before my flight but Air India never bothered to update the delayed schedule on website deliberately lying and misleading customers only to announce at the beginning of the flight that we will arrive 4 hours late The in flight service was poor Poor Customer Service Many Indians who complain about the service are boor themselves i e overweight luggage not listening to announcements letting children run amok etc I have constantly rung and emailed both AIR INDIA and TRAVELGENIO for a refund of our air fares approx Â 275 and both companies blame the lack of refund on each other The costumer service people were rude and sent us to complain to the airfrance employees who were also rude Customer service is pathetic Ridiculous service This 1 hour turned up in 7 5 hours locked in a plane because the pilot left the aircraft because his shift was over and there was no otherâ The air hostess on the plane were rude and very annoying And to my dismay one of the ground staff from Mumbai was sick rude The staff is rude and untrained and will refuse to help you The staff was pathetic no one to help Being a Govt handled airlines the staffs are never customer friendlyThe staff were rudeRude staff extremely unhelpful Multiple Reasons were given by different Air India staff on desk i e shortage of Flight No Crew available Pilot is returning from Amritsar flight and he will then fly to Trivandrum The staff is incredibly rude they dropped my bags multiple times hit my head with their personal belongings and told me I wasnâ t allowed to stand and stretch my legs when multiple people where doing the same a refund which we have to apply to Expedia for as India would not take responsibility we had to pay Â 3000 to get a flight back no apology or sympathy given or any guidance I truly disgusted and airline going out the service was poor food was disgusting and the staff rude and totally disinterested in the passagesThe staff were unapologetic and just rude Though it is out of purview the CISF staff stationed for security checks need to be given good etiquettes training considering their rude arrogant actions towards passengers If you look at the instances I have gone through so much of stress overnight no sleep and wasted the entire night and day behind this pathetic Air Line and their staff This is a late evening non stop service from Hyderabad to Chennai Half their customer service agents over the phone were extremely incompetent and very rude very rude and non professional ground staff I almost didnt book because of poor online reviews filthy toilets rude staff broken planes chronic delays and word of mouth that best to avoid The service on board was TERRIBLE Flight attendant was rude when I ask milk and water for my kids The staff at the ticketing counter in DXB was downright horrible and rude Very rude and uncooperative staff Their staff were rude and unhelpful there is no one you can talk to to complain either only an email service Very poor service and website is pathetic Ground Staff was rude a little bit The whole place smelled of booze and the staff was so rude Seating and hygiene was good which is expected after spending so much but staff s behavior and aircraft quality was pathetic The state of the aircraft throughout the journey was as if a bomb of filth had exploded Took over two hours to check in with a queue that snaked around the airport and rude ground staff Staff is so rude and unhelpful Their flights are ALWYAS delayed most of their entertainment systems dont work legroom is terrible and they are terrible at customer service Terrible air lines Worst customer service This time I had it staff is rude even to business class folks Worst customer service very arrogant agents no accountability and customer service at all One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore No compensation offered and was given abuse by some woman from customer service I would avoid this airline at all cost the fact that no one has replied to me with even an appology just shows what kind of an airline this really is The fact they paid Â 4000 for this experience is a rip off and disgusting behaviour from the staff and company Very pathetic and unprofessional approach of Air India The food is bad and the service is even worse I have been ignored in emails and had them refuse to acknowledge our treatment at the hands of their staff which in its least was rude and at its worst aggressive The staff is rude and not customer friendly The night flight took off on time but inflight service was pathetic as basis drinks not available The in flight service is pathetic It is complete disaster to see a national carrier giving such terrible service Air India staffs are very rude worst service and flght ever Delays broken chairs bad service terrible food there are too many precedences However the disgusting fact of the flight from India to Kathmandu was not clean at all The staff were rude and not very helpful The service is pathetic They are very ugly service no care for customers DO NOT BOTHER they have the worst customer service and I havenâ t yet received my refund for cancellation of my flight itâ s been a week The staff were incredibly rude both there and back Not great overall food and beverage service pretty terrible The air hostesses were rude Towards the end of the flight the bathrooms were filthy Worst customer service Their customer care service at Newark was pathetic Terrible service scheduled flight was cancelled from DEL BLR BAD ATTITUDE BAD SERVICE BAD MAINTENANCE One of my worst flights ever Their staff are very rude and didn t provide any first Aid we have never come across such a pathetic service and attitude from any place forget air hostess hostesses I complained to the staff the tried to reboot the screens but to no avail so I had a 9 hour flight with no tv Terrible Customer serviceCons Air hosts were old and rude people Rude crew and no concept of being there to serve ones needs Air India pilots are professionals but the management sucks As a person with Indian origin I should not be saying this but AIR INDIA is the worst airline and the customer service is awful we went back to end of aircraft and asked for some juice curt reply came that they will start serving in 5 minutes basically NO and go back to your seatTotally disgusted with lack of customer service poor information about flight delay left me feeling undervalued as a customer to help out appease the situation I have never come across worse customer service anywhere in the world 5 shame on the mgmt n staff to make there life hell with kids for more tjan 40 hrs With air india you walk in to rude culture less staff with no warmth Pathetic is the word for their service levels P S There is one positive point the crew on bord was very friendly and tried everything to ease the situation of those who were in trouble because of Air India s unnecessary delay Some staff seems directly rude The old lady sitting next to me asked to fill her half glass of coke and the staff refused to do so Air hostesses are little ignorant is behaving like no interest in jobs on ground as well as on board check in was poor airport staff was rude they dont care about passengers on board staff is also unprofessional missing energy in crew even pilots also looks tired they dont even wasted time on useful announcementsThe air hostess service is very disappointed not helpful very rude andThe staff was inattentive and by the time we arrived the plane was a filthy mess Word of advise for anyone considering a cheap flight to India delay the trip and earn enough money to fly on a better airline like American Delta or United Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism Arrogant and completely ancompetent service Absolutely horrible customer service each andAlso I called your customer service to make a complaint and even the person on the phone was rude and had no customer service skills at all The staff at the lounge was rude and unhelpful I felt ashamed of being Indian due to behavior of fellow indian passengers and behaviour of AI staff In flight staff ignored deteriorating state of toilets Charged twice for seat reservation and promised refund within 24 hours but took over two weeks after more phone calls HORRIBLE service they did not care I NEVER would recommend this air company to anyone They are rude employees who do not have any empathy Weak service bad condition airplane what else to expect The staff was very rude and cold Such pathetic service the customer care is rude these guys makes new rules each day greedy over money Pathetic time management and very poor service The staff was rude and the plane was not that good with lot of noise Staff very tolerant in front of rude passengers This is very bad serviceAbsolutely poor service This is the worst Airline we have ever flown The Plane broke down in Thiruvananthapuram Kerala Terrible customer service on board Horrible Service Worst airlines ever the crew was so rude even arguing with passengers and shouting at them Transit in Delhi is always a nightmare but not the airline s fault Very terrible serviceTerrible service from start to finish no cleaning rude and shabby crew no inflight safety information on the entertainment screen no introductions nothing literally had to make a run for it however some other co passengers from Air India flight were not that lucky Their customer service to air host service is terrible Worst ever airline and service and the funny thing is that staff is so useless as even theyIt was horrible to talk to Air India customer care The service was terrible plane was not clean â Once boarded the air hostess were not at all inviting and inhospitable and rude but it is damaging image of nation with poor service and poor quality of planes food was like why bother it was that bad Overall bad service bad experience and will definitely NEVER use again Its one of the worst flights i took customer services complaints dept fail to reply to emails Worst ever service as even they had my mobile no I complaint customer care by email phone Air India website feedback option and even by in personal at IGI airportRude staff that almost crushed my foot while closing the door to the airplane One of the worst airlines to ever travel After 4 days of pure heaven wandering the streets of Varanasi we found ourselves subjected to in my case the worse flight I have ever been on Worst of all was Indigo all these day with pathetic in cabin services the flight attendant were a bit more mature sic but well informed and friendly and a tad compassionate the service was rude and no one answered any of the service calls of the people around me but I was comfortable enough Pathetic service by air hostess service There was a gate change for the delayed flight too which was communicated over the PR very late but i guess thats bad service by the airport and not the airline The bads Having experienced excellent in flight service from the likes of Emirates Etihad and even Jet Airways I found Air India terrible Worst air line never travel again with them horrible service guy next to me asked for water twice never got it Although the aircraft Dreamliner was wonderful and specious even in Economy class the service food were rubbish the crew members were rude arrogant unfriendly and unprofessional Plane was dirty to the point the young lady in front of us insisted the cabin crew clean her window before takeoff This has to be one of the worst national carriers I have been on Bad food bad in air entertainment not very helpful staff and if your flying to Delhi and have a connecting flight and not much time take careThe flightbqas delayed by 2 hr 45 mins and the crew members were arrogant and there was no transparency as what wasand I donâ t think itâ s something I will do again because the leg room really stunk do and such a long flight People were Crossing line putting bags and Air India staff give privilege to all those Govt employee without thinking others has paid too Everything else right from the plane to seats to entertainment system to food to service falls short of pathetic It is the worst airline ever Absolutely not the Ai guy kept yelling as if it was the fault of the customers that the flight was delayed Overall a completely incompetent handling of the situation I wasn t surprised by the poor service etcI have to admit the worse service ever Terrible communications and poor service not again Horrible service horrible situation do not fly air India In order to get some new the button for calling a member of the staff was COMPLETELY useless This is the worst airline ever The grandmothers that they have hired as air hostesses are rude and non cooperative Never ever in my life I have experienced such bad service Air line cleared the vomit but still seat is wet They have the worst customer service I ve ever seen they don t even pretend to assist you Bad customer service to say the least Horrible customer service though the flight attendants we re trying to help there was nothing they could do One of the worst airlines I traveled on ever I think the standards of this airline are pretty terrible what i say like this hell of services The customer service is horrible Dirtiest flight ever The in flight entertainment is terrible The staff insists on waking you up for meal service which is inedible Both flights were delayed for more than an 1hr staff did not offer much explanation when asked bit unfriendly Poor inflight entertainment disrespectful flight attendants delayed the flight and lost luggage in the middle Then the flight attendant got annoyed with me about why he bought the ticket This is one of the Worst Airport Lounges I have ever been too This is one of the worst flights I have ever taken After about 15 minutes of standing one elderly gentleman lost his cool and shouted at the airline staff saying that at least we were better of seated in the lounge than being made to stand Utterly bad experience with customer care and website Iâ ve never travelled with a worse airline The service was really bad This is possibly the worst flight I have ever been on This callous attitude of Air India is very frustrating it may b just a baggage for themVery poor customer service Worst airline you can fly when i flew in to India from vancouver and needed a connection flight Air india hosts took my economy seats and two luggages a piece air India rubbish airlineWe just followed angry passengers who argued with the staff Dirty by the time of landing very poor customer service no phone support available no web support the Business Class lounge was pathetic Only to be dependent on crew whose attitude was simply HORRIBLE they treat passengers as cattle not people I know people complain about service on AI but I am not a fussy person One of the worst airlines in the air Never seen such a pathetic service in my life Very poor service Would not recommend horrible service food tastes not good at all The worst airline I have ever had the nightmare of flying on Overall service is horrible While we were getting off the plane at Chennai one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry on bag in the restricted overhead compartment Horrible 1 hour 45 minutes taken to connect customer care Incompetent staff At most times the flight would be delayed or canceled without your knowledge and you ve to fought with the airline officers to get the ticket on the same flight Horrible customer service I have seen people complaining about service at Air IndiaThird world pathetic service Truly awful customer service After I had booked the flight I read several comments about how dirty the AI seats were and how poor the service was These stinky staff needs to be trained on manner before deploying to US airport Forget the services because it does not exist The flight attendants are very rude Well it is useless to ask the air India company to ask its officers to speak properlyBad quality food at Lounge and Air Line After a really awful flight on TAP Portugal to Lisbon from JFK we had very comfortable flight back to the U S from London on Air India which seems to have the most leg room of any recent flights we have taken including on most US airlines The customer service was really worse Have in 20 years nor experienced such a bad service and can not recommend this airline to any one I expect to be treated with respect when Iâ m on a flight and am truly disgusted that you hire flight attendants like Tarek who treat people like second class citizen The airline staff failed to take a strong position and ongoing debateThe staff essentially said it was our fault for booking these flights we should have known better and there is nothing they can do Worst service I have ever received Like any other state run Airline poor service poor food poor management at Vienna Airport just now WORST AIRLINE EVER Be ready to be told to shut up from the staff members and to be taught how to speak to someone from someone that hasn t been taught manners themselves I guess asking a question and going up when your number is called is a crime even the hospitality staffs are rude and rough I can t believe they continue to be in business with such poor customer service and questionable ethics Worst Flight Ever I am the latest victim of their customer service assault with the airline not loading my baggage on a domestic flight from Mumbai to Kolkata which I was connecting from Frankfurt I have heard alot about Air India s bad servicesThe crew seemed totally ignorant of the boarding system As we were coming from the bathroom an irate airport worker took it out of our possession with fury and left us stranded again The Air India ground staff in Delhi were the most arrogant smug insensitive and pathetic group of travel staff Poor service delayed flight because we later learned the scheduled pilot was drunk and failed pre flight checks in flight entertainment broken Bad maintained aircraft with worst people to take care Very bad airline Very bad customer care I flew Air India a few time before and had no complaints until I needed their poor customer service With such kind of terrible service and service personals who are really reluctant to do their jobs how will the airlines survive Horrible service I was not allowed to board a flight from Mumbai to JFK New York because despite me checking in at 7 p m A complete waste of time by incompetent ready for combat troops Poor customer service Food was awful really some of the worst airline food I ve had in years The Passengers are travelling from HYDERABAD INDIA TO NEWYORK JFK because of connecting flight of AIR INDIA frm hyderabad delayed the next flight of AIR INDIA was missed for just 30 mins as a result of this the 60 years old passengers allowed to wait and post pone the trip for 1 day more over passengers are asked to wait for 8 hours t get a hotel room Staff at Mumbai Airport seem to be the worst they think they are doing you a favour and not their job Worst Airline in the world I just hope they do something about it before we hear a plane losing its door mid airHorrible flight experience Pathetic flight and crew but the way it was dealt with by the crew was just awful An advice to passengers please have all your doubts clarified if language is a problem please take the help of a local in the Q near you I think it is because it is government and not private they lack hospitality quite old and little rookyCustomer service was appalling on two occasions I asked for water and was told â The staff was rude in both to and from flights didnâ t have a good experience I am extremely shocked by the poor quality of the airline The worst experience of my life and the worst staff I ve dealt with Worst company ever But I had a slight curiosity of how a national airline on a long flight can be bad Also I ve never seen flight attendants getting pissed off for requesting for a bottle of water except in AIR INDIA The power of being in charge of the business class cabin has seriously gone to his head giving barely any notice with no apparent reason or apology and subsequently threw our entire travel plans in chaos I the service i receive is bad Yes Sir India is also known for competent pilots but Air India is known more famously for flight delays and rude air hostesses One of the worst service I have ever come across and that too on an International flight The ground staff at Delhi airport is the worst I have ever encountered What has ensued is the worst example of customer service I have ever encountered in 60 years of flying Worst airline uncomfortable seats do not recline completely He planes were dirty the service was really badtransferred things from one beg to another beg on airport and spent one hour and staff are horrible The staff forgot that it was because of us that they earned their bread It always 30 min behind schedule and worst of all the check in staff most time is so poorly trained that they work too slow andâ Their customer service SUCKS Of all the above a 4 year old boy fell sick in the air and the boyâ sThe airline staff was completely incompetent I hope one day this service will be close and they will loose their job because of their ignorance The international flight from Del to JFK was pathetic old plane the entertainment remote was broken It was the worst flight ever Condition of flight was very bad seat was not at all moving Worst Airline to travel Poor service cabin crew sitting at the back not really interested in people travelling with them Service poor in fact very few positives unfortunately Poor show Air India at least the passengers could be informed in advance in such conditions The staff were unfriendly and it was an overall terrible experience Very poor customer service of Air India one of the worst staff in the world the ground staff might be the reason of the fall of this airline the staff with whom I had an argument was in the ticket counter and the same guy was present at the luggage check in counter very aggressive personAfter 2 years of discussing with Air India management I start to believe their own staff is part of these crimes to compensate for their low wages but this time the lady came around with paper and pen and asked us which of the two we wanted to eat vegetarian or non vegetarian that was a big surprise and poor standard and service for Business Class When we demanded why this decision took place they said that it was a smaller flight than how it was supposed to be thus they took such a decision The worst part was they was a senior staff person looked to be from air india executives watching the whole time I am very disappointed by their serviceInstead of offering an apology the rude staff said if you are feeling uncomfortable then you should not travel on this flight A good Airlines but service is bad have I had poor customer service like air India This is one of the best infrastructure and worst customer service or care The air hostess on the flight were bunch of old ladies who asked the passengers to close the overhead luggage doors not just one but all of them and to top it up no thanks or shukaria Even 2 hours before you cant select seat and even boarding counter person cant edit your middle worse system alloted seats Very bad customer service trying to book pay seats Not only should Air India be ashamed of their shoddy operations and customer service but they are a mis representation of the Star Alliance brand Although the airline had often been accused of tardiness my flight from DEL to IXL and the return flight kept time I witnessed 3 separate Madrid airport customer service staff yelling at customers I called the customer service again and they literally told me that they cannot help me sorting out the situationThe service was poor Air India does not keep to flight timings including the carriers appear average Horrible service personals the hostess was too oldThey then despite our protests and explanations sent us through to the wrong part of the airport where we were stuck overnight without our hotel because we we transferring without a visa One of the worst airlines in the industry both in terms of service and comfort flexibility The air hostesses were exactly the same as going out and the food was disgusting in general the service was so bad the hostesses were all rude and not very helpful especially when assisting an elderly lady on board at trying to find her medication After all service not much great Would not recommend using this airline poor customer service poor communication and confusing information from the online service with regards to baggage allowance tickets saying 1 thing and website and customer services saying completely different cost me a lot to purchase trekking equipment in country because of this simple error India actually has one of the worst airline safety rankings for domestic aircraft making it safer to fly in Pakistan and Bangladesh hell even Air Koryo from North Korea is safer than Indian planes Unfortunately the lounge in Cochin airport was without wifi and with a poor food and beverage service Looks like its run by a bunch of bribe accepting morons who want to just loot and trouble passengers and give them their life s worst flying experience Always late and irresponsible staff My flight with AirAsia was the worst flight I have been on in my entire life coming from someone who has traveled for 3 years I ask them repeatedly that for my son daughter very rude irresponsible service in flightI think it is the worst flight of my life Commercial staff behaved rudly and not bothered to either note or rectify to avoid in future Along from the ridiculously poor service and general Indian disorganization and amateurish unprofessionalism that afflicts this airlines it is also quite dishonest and untrustworthy Worst airline worst service and absolute indifference from the staff I am so disappointed in this service So if you were using your phone for entertainment then you run the risk of draining out the batteries the staff crew was rude and not very helpful Probably the worst website of all airlines The worst company I ve ever flew And customer service is so bad that they don t even answer to yourâ Poor inflight service I requested for water when entered the plane which came after two reminders and that two after approx I would say you cannot say it is a bad flight experience with Air India I take planes many times a year and I must say I donâ t think I ever had such a bad experience with customer service But this particular flight was very disappointing due to several shortcomings I always avoided Air India since last 12 Years because of my experience of there terrible and non friendly service but this time as my friends had tickets with Air IndiaSeats for coach class were good but the inflight video service was poor and the movie selection consisted of older films This is the worst International airline I have taken ever I tried to extend my ticket the way they have acted and the staff they have to help the customers is worse than anything I recommend never travel on this flight they cut the call on my face at the time of emmergencyAir India is the worst airline you can think ofThis is a direct flight from New Delhi to New York and takes around 15 hours However the quality of aircraft was very bad Pity staff just saying sorry for everything services are poor which can be improved and staff should be trained well to remove govt tagThe airline runs on tax payers money but services are really poor After all that my connecting flight was delayed and when it came the plane stopped working Poor air quality inside plane The service from the flight attendants was awful they were not pleasant not smiling and most importantly they do not speak good English to make announcements This was the worst international flight I have ever been on Upon complaining to the flight attendants we were said that post food services it would be rebooted and the in flight systems would work If the customer service was this bad I can only imagine the flight ð One of the worst Airline and itâ s proved today earlier my friends speak about Air India flight that you fly any airline apart from Air India because they donâ t bother for their customers today one of the desk staff want to help me out to proceed for boardingI must tell you I had very low expectation of service from Air india when I decided to travel on it Having collected the boarding passes we headed to the aircraft when suddenly an announcement for the last call of boarding was made Not at all an bad airline to travel with The remote controls of both seats were dead despite repeated software resets by crew it was useless Its the worst airline to travel with Worst Airline experience The bags were on belt swiftly and I was out of the green channel in less than 25 minutes from the time flight docked at the gate Very disappointed with the service on this flight Air India is a waste of time and money please choose another air line when traveling in India They are making kissing sounds at me yet when I tell the flight attendants they tell me to just ignore it The airline staff were totally indifferent to his ire and simply walked away all while the disgusting staff had it all along and snickered about it Air India didn t even acknowledge child passenger 2 since I was traveling with kid despite requesting a seat with no co passenger they put us up in congested isle seat whereas gave a three seater to a young white teenage passenger 3 Despite requesting juice air hostess denied serving it for 8 he out of 16 citing a lame reason that bar is locked 4 the service was too bad andStaff seemed tired and peevish even when boarding Over the last few years Air India has got quite notorious for its delays and poor service While going from delhi to ktm i missed my flight coz of PPOR MANAGEMENT from air india However the customer service is poor with few exceptions Worst long faces that I have seen on a crew ever we were just sitting at the aircraft for almost an hour and none of the crew has even bothered to offer water the worst thing was we get a help after 3hrs of waiting on board by the crew member The air hostesses were really rude to passengers and we were really hesitant to ask to a second service of beer The issue that I have experienced is in disgust at the level of no service from air India at all There was more than 10 people waiting for the costumer service 3 People had already started queuing up for boarding due to delay and at last minute the staff started announcing sequenced boarding 20 and above 15 and above etc and asking every one to follow single queue Itâ s the worst customer experience service that Iâ ve ever tried service in flight was ok specially as we had very low expectations You can think how irresponsible of them it was to say that their own office in the other city is not picking the phone when called from the other office in New Delhi We had more than an hour of delay after the system of the airport crashed Stuck on the run way for over 3 hours with little communication from the staff I didn t want to waste a day and kept asking the flight attendant They had the best times for departure and arrival however the food on board was not good and the service was poor films were ok and seats were okExtremely poor service right from checking in to in flight services I suspect that flights are delayed because of the lackadaisical attitude of ground staff cleaning crews etc Air India call centre never answer the phone say waiting time is 10mins butThe air hostess waited for me to ASK and then just saidI have heard alot about Air India s poor service and cleanliness but to be honestall not good experience not good its service its one reason for its losses by its hospitality serviceSo overall just a bad service with employees looking at you as if they were doing you a favour probably forgetting that I have to pay what for me is a big amount of money to travel with them Problem with my second flight food was that Lunch items were more spicy and the snacks that they gave at the end was less and seems low budget poor food and beverage service arrogant behavour of the unkempt crew very basic inflight entertainment For over 2 hours the crew tried various tactics nothing worked As it was only approx 4 30 Hrs journey i preferred sleeping all the time rather than grudging about poor service The ground staff had know idea what was going on and the flight arrived a total 16 hours delayed compared to the original 21 hour flying time Trying to get through to customer service takes a minimum of 42 minutes to then go through what is required to then be put on hold for a further 10 minutes plus while they go and ask their supervisor then to be told I have to send an email to a department which doesn t have a telephone numberVery poor attitude of flight attendants and very harsh to do their basic job also The situation was totally out of control and Air India staff was grossly untrained to handle the situation the flight started one hour late and there was no announcement about the delay we had to check with the duty staff every now and then Flight finally took off at 4am due 3am when original flight time was supposed to be scheduled 8 45pm But in the past few years there has been many news reports about the bad service how during mid flight the window pane came out and hit a passenger s head the rude behaviour of AI crew etc If it had just been on this flight I would have blamed the crew but it happened on both long haul and internal flights so is obviously bad training on Air Indias part No one informed us anything and the air India staff was literally sleeping It saddens me to see the state of this Airline that insults their own Maharaja The lady crew member was no better off â an elderly lady who again didnâ t have an iota of smartness and alertness she was looking tired and like a school teacher from some government school I have had the very unfortunate experience of having to complain about services and staff on an Air India Flight First of all very poor reception then the entertainment system would not function so there is no music or video or movie nothing Their attitude was like where can you go now even the pilot didn t apologise for the more than one hour delay my wife and i booked seats well in advance both ways and both times we were seated apart a complete disaster of an excuse for an airline check in at delhi completely chaotic you would have to get there 5 hours in advance to get through the queues never again Worst customer experience Their Customer Service is appalling and I would NEVER EVER book any flights through TRAVELGENIO or AIR INDIA again But the lady staff who attended us was very slow took around 30 mts for issuing boarding passes to 6 pax ahead of us who are traveling on international route Air India flight no AI101 New Delhi to new York left late by half an hour but reached dot in time at New York Long flight with very miserable staff going out and on return flights was a terrible experience incoming flight delayed so out going delayed Very poor inflight service Though the flight departed bit behind scheduled at 01 15 hrs but no drinks were served during that night and the same was served almost after 8 hours of departure of the flight i e next day in the forenoon according to IST though it was long night flight for about 16 hours However we did not experience poor service But to my agony the seat offered to me had a broken seat and nonetheless they bothered to change it for me in a half empty flight Air India lied and said it was on the next flight it never arrived after continuous calls to retrieve That is incredible bad customer service as I could have stayed in the hotel for more hours instead of standing in the airport where everything is super expensive I booked this flight because my scheduled spicejet flight was unexpectedly cancelled with less than 24 hours I rang for a orange juice the hostess took 40 min to answer the bell Other air staff were asleep in the back row the grouse was the staff seems uptight stressed wish they could smile not seem bothered to be called for service I guess they have connections with security services in the airport as security people will not leave people early even if other people allow us front Rony said we coudl get a refund only for the AI staff member to say NO refund And the best part is NO ONE is bothered about the disgust shown by ground personnel in both stations The entertainment system of that entire blocks around 12 20 seats surrounding my seat was faulty and did not work throughout the flight Air India staff at both airports at Amritsar and Delhi were both rude who did not want to help passengers including the elderly who were diabetics and on medication My only complaint relates to the timing of the second meal service about 4 5 hours after breakfast with at least another 6 hours of flight time remaining seemed a little odd The service was so bad that I re booked a return flight with a different airline Travelled on several international flights and looks like this is by far the worst Did not have much expectations after my past experiences in the eighties and early nineties before private airlines were allowed when I had to no option but to fly Air India Indian Airlines this and probably will be the worst airline in the aviation history First the flight is delayed by about one hour and no information from the staff till 15 minutes past the scheduled time of 8 10 PM fight happened between passengers and Air india Officials which were not guilty and were not acknowledging the fact that passengers were delayed by 6 hours Nothing much has changed with the attitude of staff both ground handling inflight crew and they continue to show a pathetic approach to customer service Having travelled on many national carriers as well as a number of budget airlines this has to be one of the worst experiences It was a little difficult to sleep since the staff was serving food or drink and you canâ t keep your chair on an incline because it disrupts the food tray Although the line for checking in was not long it took more that 30 minutes to get any service since the staff was busy sorting out problems of the NRI travellers Had a hard time arguing regarding the incident occur without any notice and later changed my tone to requesting mode as the staffs were so ignorant that they even were not look at my face Crew call pings were completely ignored What a hassle we left with our own and taking the trolly full of luggage and headed for domestic section of the airport a long Q waiting for us With so many passengers almost full flight out of four toilet one is not working which is really not good for flight like air India The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will well at least thatâ s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section The check in lady wasted some time but after some urging she was willing to allow me to check in but her supervisor standing behind her said no need toâ I travelled by Air India Alliance Air Flight No 9551 from Chennai to Madurai on 25 3 18 Despite being in the Red for many years they have not cut corners on service and food to save money else the number dies not exist worst worst and worst airline ever never to be recommended in my life to anyone Well the air hostess was in a really bad mood and kind of acted impolite in general to every passenger I have seen bad days of Air India not any more It feels like abyss its over 48hrs now our baggage is still untraced there is no online site to track lost baggage or any customer care service to help Both the time Airline staff behavior at the gate or before boarding was not what you expect Very poor customer support and never willing to travel in air India It s the worst airline experience I have had on the phone whereinit takes 1 hour or more to get on touch with customer care orThis has been the worst flight experience Due to inefficiences at the Business Class counter missed the earlier flight The rest of the staff was very uninviting to say the least Staff is always tired and don t expect much from them We are very upset from Air India team Air India is a worst flight donâ t travel staff of airThe issues starter right at the check in totally disorganised there was a long que staff was taking almost 10 15 min to check in each pax I flew in this non stop flight There were barely anything in the in flight entertainment system let alone anything good When the flight was about to reach its destination it was asked to take a round on the out skirts of city for an hour due to which these Airline authorities burnt lots of fuel which is always un accountable andalthough one of the lady staff came after 15 minutes out of only two staffs and replies me back very rudely we are only two staff and time has ran out of service if still you need an orange juice then help yourself Staff were often annoyed with basic requests from passengers Flight leaves at 11 pm a and not take the in flight meal and one would expect at least a decent dinner As it happened our first flight was delayed and we wouldn t have made the earlier connection anyway Staff in Delhi lazy and uninterested Shortly after takeoff a passenger fell ill and the service after that was bad if you asked for something they would say we have a crisis on boardMy biggest complaint which I hesitate to mention is that they made a racket for about an hour after dinner service when I was trying to sleep Once I almost missed my flight due to sudden change of flight time coz I had to go through the transit The staff in the singapore to delhi flight at 08 20 on 14th december had the rudest staff experienced Many hours plane delay and missing connecting internal flight Crew is least bothered for passenger s dont know the reason and the quality of the flight is poor also it takes almost 5 hours to reach chennai The entertainment system failed for my wife Food and Bar service is again not flawlessI never expected our National carrier will be having such an low standard of service Maybe its attitude when Air India promote staff to serving Business class Its been almost 5 months since we had to cancel a segment of our Air India flight due to their re scheduling we were waiting for washroom after a while last washroom opened and an air hostess came out and LOCKED the washroom from outside since we were waiting from long i asked air hostess to unlock the washroom but nevertheless all services slowed right down for the entire flight The worse thing is that the in flight entertainment system was not even working Management should open their eyes and do something before loyal customers walk away and the airline end up like jet airways I was appalled by the lack of cabin services on flight 1 The first flight Jamnagar to Mumbai was almost on time with a delay of around 20 mins The cabin staff was gracious and seemed helpless REVIEW OF AIR INDIA FLIGHT No 9551 As usual AI acts like they don t know it is coming and have a major meltdown in service when it comes A non stop flight that took a longer route and a refuelling halt at Vienna due to closure of air space over Pakistan My todayâ s flight is yet to depart Chennai even after 2 hours and the crew fail to give proper or timely update When I asked the Air India people they simply said that they do not know where my luggage has gone The flight leaves late in theâ I had dreaded the 14 hours we d be in the airAir india Staff at ord got an extra brain too they say it s your problem to take luggage and recheck in as if we booked ticket till delhi and a connection in morning The flight attendants keep avoiding customers I have routinely encountered Indigo or Spice Jet flights getting delayed and cancelled and these are not spoken about but an Air India flight getting delayed in taking off by about 15 minutes is enough to create an uproar Hostess rolled eyes behind a Mom who was struggling with a toddler Once we have to wait for ladder and ground staff even though Air India is over staff by more than double than any other air line On a 7 hour flight the majority of the stewardesses simply choose to sleep behind a curtain Very poorly maintained food looks stale and Cabin crew is as worst the flight itself isAlthough I did web check in it took me over an hour to get my printed boarding pass staffs at the baggage drop were so slow which reminded me of sloths coupled with a staff taking a break without anyone attending counter and even without notifying floor manager but their service is quite slow and inefficient I mean about the air conditioner case Dirty cabins entertainment system not working on three seats in a row plus no pillows on the international flight to New Delhi and awful food choices on both international flight and domestic connection New Delhi to Bangalore As much as I want to travel more in AI it keeps on missing on few service related matters Only one beverage service in a nine and a half hour flight It was really sad that there is so much being talked about how Air India national airlines is going down the drain but the Airline team itself is the one which is pushing down the drain We booked our flight 2 months back but suddenly we see the flight timings change without any prior intimation to us The worst international airlines They would do better if someone who pays for service tells them what they are lacking 2 Days before the due date we had an email saying thethe flight from Delhi to Pantnagar was cancelled due to operational reasons and another flight 2 days laterIt s been many times now that Air India is never on time was going to Singapore and the flight got delayed by 2 hours imagine first u have to check in atleast 3 hours before the flight timei am really wondering is this a fight or some kind of junkie aircraftFrom delayed flights to ill kept planes to bad food to condescending and surly air crew and that was helpful since being by the ext door tends to be a pretty cold area of the planeYour air stewards are so boring and show their cheap looks when asked for something Staff of some airlines treats economy class as cattle class Due to this delay I missed my next flight to my final destination Srinagar Food served was below par and must be addressed as it discomforts passengers on non stop long flights of 16 hours It was really sad to see the conditions of Indian flight flying internationally You had to go half way round the airport for the next internal flight but with Air India you flew into and out of terminal 2The flight kept getting delayed and there was no announcement or any sort of information Only thing to complain was it reached 1 hour late due to air traffic Even though I have emailed a complaint and used the online service there has been no response Bad experience because of the confusion of the flight I was dearly disappointed with the service compared to other airlines The lack of customer caring and the rudeness was appalling During this entire fiasco the Air India staff only provided us with a biscuit packet with 2 biscuits and a lunch voucher that only worked during a horrible time I would probably give the same opinion like the rest crew is reluctant food is average to low seatFlight supposed to leave at 7 25 am to Delhi from Chandigarh didn t leave till 1 45 so missed connection flight to Jaipur I have never ever received such poor service and would advise no one travels via this airline if they want to enjoy their holiday 2 Days before the due date we had an email saying the flight was cancelled due to operational reasons and another flight 2 days laterBut pilot announced that the flight is delayed by 1 45 hours The flight took off before time landed before time but no coach service for more than 20 minutesI wish the same experience in other flights of Air India too to keep its flag hoisted with the same grandeur There is a 4 hr addition to flight time making it an over 21 hour flight Owned by India govt the air India flight is pretty convenient and mostly less expensive than any other flights to and from India Depends on the destinationsThe ticket for me from Indore to Dubai with a layover I had work in Delhi which I finished comfortably between 11 am and 5 pm was for 14k only which got tripled when I took another airline back home in the absence of Air India flights There was no beverage service offered except water In short apart from courteous staff and piloting nothing in this flight deserves admiration the plane was so dated dirty smelled pretty ordinary and everything rattled the entire flight Food was decent and the leg room was good too but the service and the entertainment system were at their lowest Scheddule was delayed a cause of Mumbai air trafficI had to fly with them once again this month since they are the only airline offering non stop service to Delhi Only one beverage service for a nine and a half hour flight Found check in staff to be a little on the miserable side too our agent goofed up and while there was a valid ticket it wasnâ t blocked and my friend would have to stand in various queues if the Air India manager at Madrid Baragas airport had not stepped up and worked with her team to support Their entertainment was not very good and the food was OK and the service was almost non existent between meals I seriously doubt that this aircraft has had any money spent on the passenger cabin since put into service Initial flight from BOM to DEL was delayed by 2 hours AIR INDIA AHMEDABAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CHANGE YOUR STAFF OR TEACH THEM CUSTOMER SERVICE IMMEDIATELYwhat time flight will take off and they send us in hotel very far from airport hotel and food is not good as well Staff just seemed disinterested couldn t really be bothered I argued with the Air India staff in Bangalore and it was not useful no wonder didn t find a single non indian in the entire flight Booked a ticket for 24 hours journey due to a flight cancellation the journey turned to 72 hoursð ð Air India staff of Cochin international airport made us wait for 7 hoursVery very poor service regarding this Staff is not courteous or dont have any ethics However to our agony despite telling the concerned airline official passengers were not served any refreshment or even simple water The staff then pilot got involved and told me the broken seat was a safety riskBut too old staff though very hospitable Clean cabin Clean washroomsThe lone flight from Jamnagar to Mumbai perhaps the only flight from Jamnagar is an Air India service To my shock and horror the staff declined him to take my baggage saying its breach of trust Perhaps the only airline left which offers complementary food in economy class We had to arrange for my parents pick up from airport to the funeral home but the carelessness of these Air India employees made them miss the funeralSeating is 2 3 2 and the plane is at least 15 years old with no upgrades since they went into service Imagine 15 hours of flight time with nothing to watch When I ask for issue boarding pass for both segments staff refuses to issue boarding pass forâ AI changed my 10K Business seats to 9C Not much help as the seat will remain flat and never come in upright position except by manual help of two strong male flight attendants This was attributed to one of the flight attendants reporting sick at the last minute and so had to wait for one of the standby ones to report in My only problem was the 5 minute time change of our first flight which we were informed of and the resulting change of our connecting flight to one 4 hours later due to the minimum transfer time in Mumbai which we were not told about Particularly with a woman passenger who neither understood Hindi or English probably her first flight sat on a wrong seat and couldn t find her family members To cancel return ticket not able to connect customer care Worst experience in flight service Disappointing part is that less of operating flights often cancellation of flight old flight attendants So we had a 9 hour flight with no way of knowing how far away from our destination we were and with no in flight entertainment The person next to my husband had her tray table down and her very large bag on that the entire flight This was an AI101 flight Boeing 777 300ER from DEL JFK 15hr non stop flight They first stopped in Vienna for a fuel refill which was shared with the passengers at the last minute The air craft was rusty and literally falling apart Hand woven decades old stained smelly seat covers One of the least comfortable flights plane was dated and seats felt quite hard with minimal cushioning During the entire flight they didn t bring any water beverages etc AC not working and air hostess seems the most sleepy person I ever saw Third point is you will get some snacks for free not like indigo where u will find air hostess selling chips for 100 rs staff didnâ t even inform me about me missing connecting flight which I missed due to the airline delay The return flight to Bangkok was greatly enhanced by the male flight attendant whose name I failed to get He saved the round trip experience from mundane to enjoyable with in charge confident attitudeAll counter staff also courteous despite late night flight The rate was cheaper than other private airlines maybe because of early morning flight but as soon as i am in yhe flight gradually i forgot about the delay as the service was good breakfastâ I ve flown Air India many times from Delhi and the service at DEL is always been much slower than other airlines Staff gave us a reason stating some technical problem with the flight and a spare part problem On the way out 2 of our 4 televisions would not work and when we called the staff overIt was delayed by 12 hours due to some technical snag of airline and failure of communication computer system of Airport It was a comfortable flight in terms of travel but really scary in terms of Service The experience on the flight could not in any way ameliorate the problems faced by passengers courtesy the ground staff of Air India The movie screen did not work at all making a long flight seem even longer I was told by a seatmate that this was common on this airline Chose this flight as my wife was expecting and wanted a non stop flight from Delhi to Australia If they improve their timelines then they can bring up the Airline it has to be done with sole intention of survival and no hanky panky persons to be allowed to delay the service Sometimes that staff would say people would be accommodated on Jet Airways some passengers would be taken to Coimbatore and Kochi We found out when we arrived at the airport the flight time was changed and had to wait for 3 hours Air India texted her previous day called her to give automated message about flight delay on morning of flightStaff are grumpy and unhelpful starting at the Terminal checking inMy only complaint is that the ground staff could have found out about their Hyderabad flight s ETA before they started boarding and accordingly delayed the boarding instead of making the passengers wait inside the uncomfortable and suffocating environment of the stationary aircraft The level of service is below average and their entertainment system is poor 1st time with air India after traveling I am regretting that why I didn t travel before with this Air line staff are really helpful I don t know why people give negative reviews about air India flight time was 11 PM and was again delayed for 3 hours and started at 2 AM The air quality inside the air craft was bad It was an international flight and delayed by 1 hour In my opinion Air India would have to greatly improve their service to qualify as horrible On both flights unable to watch any entertainment as service not working or inaudible Had to wait for 5 hours at Mumbai cause our scheduled flight was cancelled weeks earlier I have called customer Service department as i was unable to do web checkinwe had booked another air line and flew to delhi as we were not in a position to lose our meetings scheduled Air India has the worst most rigid frequent flyer program given no vouchers for a meal or beverage for this supposed operational reason for cancellation then waited extra hour late flight It was either a case of holding it up for the whole flight or doing without Was quite shocked at how much the standard of air India has fallen You need to be in two 2 different lines one for getting your boarding pass stamped again by the staff and then actual boarding All the air india staff could say was they will refund I bought the ticket thru air India expecting to play with their luggage rules and realized in the airport that the operator of the flight is Alliance Air and that they only allow 15kg per passenger and 5kg of carry on I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home and I flew back Shame New Dehi Air India Assistance Office Cabin crew appeared to be a bored set of people excellent flight when jet airways ditched me and not yer given refund of cancelled flight staff of air india was cooperative and helpful plane was on time i recommend to friends this national carrierThe staff at the gate told us that our bags haven t even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list Also majority of the head phones a few of our in flight entertainment screens were out of order again without anyredressal from the curt staff Business Lounge in Delhi provides poor food drink and service as well Unreliable service and not providing service for what you paidThere are many good companies out there so it won t be hard to replace Air India KjetilIn flight service was slow Ad week before the flight it was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next flight which did not have business seats no problem with that butLater on the Air India staff told us that our flight would actually be leaving at 2 30 AM not PM The check in staff at Mumbai as usual were very less resulting in long queues As I was late I had to buy myself another internal flight with a different airline A 8 5 hour flight without a film is a very long flight I truly hope you fix your service because you have lost many costumers on this site aka I am not the only one who is very upset I ve never seen such impatient staff at any airport in the world After take off we were offered lunch which was probably better than Economy but not as good as I have had on other Business Class flights Our flight scheduled at 8pm kept on being delayed and delayed till it was then cancelled They were more involved within themselves to sort their internal problem instead of providing the services to the passenger Living in Minneapolis twin city area always missing the direct flight from India Flight boarded one hour late Maybe Air India or airport management should publicly announce by putting up notices at Indira Ghandi airport compelling that all needy persons should pay for this assistance I missed the Business Class travel because of some flap at the booking endIt was the most miserable international flight we have ever taken If you ever need customer service this airline is not for you I think in case of Air India flight we have to keep minimum three hours gap for connecting flights As per my experience two times Air India flights getting a delay and even don t have proper in flight announceI found out later that the flight was dry because it flew over Saudi airspace the last time I checked other airlines only suspended service in the airspace which takes about 1 hour to clear But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight The cabin crew appear a bit impersonal as expected in a government run service but are quite efficient 5 30pm was told about delay given possible flight time of 1 30am when checking in air India desk were not updated until 11pm The staff at London airport was very rough Trying to talk to customer care is of no use even for normal queries they just put you on hold for hoursâ One would think that the first class line would have the best agent at the counter but this is not Air India s thinking hardly knew what they were supposed to do the crew in the flight was grumpy at its best over all a bad experienceAir hostess was quite cold and even on raising alarum callsMy Web check in seat was changed the seat which was assigned to me was broken so the air hostess moved me to another seat the uncourtious rude staff said this is what the system is showing People remember an experience based on the service of the staff which fell short of minimum expectation The plane was dirty screens broken remotes missing security issues of children laying in the aisles jumping on the seats luggage in the aisles flight attends gone missing a good part of the time people standing in the aisles for hours at a time despite warnings to useâ And also at the airport there were some so called staff who impolitely tells that â you are gonna miss your flight if you donâ t sit on our wheelFelt like a very very long flight the crew are lazy old and rude very poor Air India must learn from Competitors like below The first flight from London Heathrow to Delhi was virtually empty around 25 people on the flight I came from Dubai through emirates airlines to Delhi then to catch a domestic air India flight the ground staff didn t take my flight ticket and they had said that the flight is overbooked andLong delay on a 45 minute flight due air traffic controlSo many things I could mention of why this was the worst flight experience ever in travelling regularly around the world but the topper was when my mealâ The staff were not friendly and not much customer oriented with service Then the flight in london landed and it was already 2030hrs and our original flight time was scheduled to land at 1800 hrs and we cant do such a long flight sitting separately There were 3 AI staff members that attend to wheelchairs sitting around and would not help out Poor Customer ExperienceOnly negative point is that Air India still have aged In flight staffs though they should shift them to ground staff I have dealt with uncooperative customer service many times before but this airline specializes in not doing what they are professionally obligated to do I was hungry on all my flights becuase of the way catering is provided on board Flights often run late waiting time is more than the actual flying time overall it was my first flight with Air India and really appreciate the maintenance of craft its facilities and schedule but not the attitude of staff quality of food and its standard The staff is so untrained and unprofessional that you d end up doing anything to just take the flight out like we ended up paying twice for the same ticket I had earlier had a very bad experience travelling from Madurai to Mumbai recently and was very apprehensive when i again had to take a flight an AI flight back to Mumbai The curt rude flight attendants asked 3 of us to seat at 3 different vacant seats of the aircraft thus spoiling the journey of travelling together The staff does not come even after pressing the button so many times Waited at the counter for more than 2 hours with no assistance from the airline staffs but I kept on disturbing them every nowIâ ve also never ever been on a flight which had zero beverage service We preferred the Air India route option as this was a non stop flight to an Indian city from Newark avoiding the hassle of transit in Europe or Middle East Ground staffs at the Delhi airport were not helpful at all rather very slow to respond and very vague in their duties although they have logo in front and back of their of their wear clearly writtenIn Mumbai though the baggage handlers could not come for work the Air India counter staff handled the baggages and saw that passengers were not put to any difficulty Worst experience with this Airlines we dont expect like this service no body to travel in future also First the onboard entertainment system didn t work for all the 3 seats we were in row 38 She didn t allow me to accompany my wife who was taken away from a different gate of the aircraft um a frequent flyer but they have been so rude on seeing me having extra weighted luggage the service girl who was issuing our boarding passes had no idea about carrying charges and she did not allow a single kilo when we were having baby I had to pay for all the extra weight will try for other flights for sure from next timeBut main thing is that Air India flights are always delay The only reason we booked this flight was because it was non stop and was the only flight we could find that would arrived in Delhi mid day instead of late nights Flew business class from bom to bkk seats were very comfy but the service was very ordinary food was pathethic no tea coffee serviceThe flight was delayed due to late arrival of the plane On checking in the Air India staff had no idea which gate the flight was going from the display boards did not even show the flight all the airlines were showing I think expecting hot snacks tea coffee isn t too much for a full service airline charging 8000 per head for the 45min trip Air india Flight delayed by approx 1 hour 30minutes in ktm then connecting air india flight was missed from delhi to Birmingham Uk I had the opportunity to travel air india since 1984 it was always a pain to travel in air india staff ground and cabin crew were hard to deal with not good they just bored to do service not proper service in cabin The only reason to book this Air India flight is because it is only 15 1 5 hours non stop to Delhi The first flight my TV s sound didn t workI have always had problems with air in in various ways Air India offered the worst possible service on the return flight but I miss my flight because of the people who work in counter of air India air India employee let all passengers who were saying they were late to jump the queue causing delays also for people who were there more than 2 hours before still there is no proper customer care or department who can take theâ The flight attendant told me that some of the screens in business and first class were not working either The staff made sure on their own that we could sit at least in the same row which helped us in taking care of our children without much trouble I was very surprised that the it system worked so poorly Here are the worst features of my travel What I am surprised is when I asked the staff at the airport I doubt they even called any other hotel in front of us and lied to our faces saying it was full Still has service of food Which is comforting in the odd time flight The staff members simply don t know what customer service is about so i decided to take direct flight from delhi to rajkot as i was getting it at a very low price the cabin crew on this flight was at its shabbiest best â out of the 2 male pursers Mr Kanth was having a pot belly and had a dirtyThey could not arrange any arrangements except for the late evening flight to Ahmedabad I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation but no one responds The Air India flight to maldives is the shortest non stop flight from New Delhi The boarding of the plane wasn t very organized Flight started with delay as we were informed about the delay delay because of technical snag of some brake issue and that too after we have boarded not a great start But because I was the weight allowance on the next flight was only 20kg he refused to check them through And air india seat selection site wont work 9 tries out of 10 no option of small airports in TripAdvisor It would take less than 2 hours to reach Delhi But although the Airport Authority of India did not have any problem with it Air India restricted me from going out of the New Delhi Airport and quickly forced me to do the Security checking for the next flight Expected much better service based on past experiance the flight was supposed to start 1 30 for which we got a postpone message from the airlines saying its at 4 30 vch never happened its started around 7 00 and by the time we reached delhi we missed our connecting flight and inside the flight none of the monitors r working n when complained abt itThe staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won t make it on the CPH plane So I do that and no one at the airport picks up except the ATC albeit annoyed which says to call the same customer service line Very inefficient staff and service None of the screens on our part of the plane worked Flight time changed many times allready half year in advance The plane was old and seemed like it should have been taken out of service years ago theâ My in flight entertainment system did not work for the entire flight and the flight attendants were nowhere to be found so I pressured the staff as to why and no answer Connecting flight from Hyderabad to Mumbai was on time whereas international flight from Mumbai to Muscat was delayed for 4 hours their is no any update from airlines or trip ae not only did this add hours to the flight it was UNANNOUNCED until the plane began to head north after about an hour in the air No information on departure boards no Air India staff at the airport and no assistance offered by the Air India customer helpline but the service and the staff were not helpful at all Professionalism lacking from the staff Appalling food and very limited attention from the cabin crew I guess this is the result of a Government owned airline Flight attendants did not help a lot When I asked a crew member if I can sit there she said I will have to talk to my senior It was noticed by his supervisor who asked him why he was doing that on a Business Class TicketRecently Jet airways has cancelled the services on Pune Hyderabad sector which makes Airindia the next airline of choice however they also operate it with their low cost option of Air Alliance the aircraft was ATR class which they should replace with Airbus or Boing This is not enough food for a ten hour long flight They took no responsibility for the missed flight and provided no compensation for the loss of our hotel room in Bodhgaya the extra hotel night in Delhi or meals so why this attitude from the staff I left my passport on the counter to reach in my bag and get a pen and the counter staff TOOK MY PASSPORT LIED ABOUT ITCheck in staff are in their usual can t be bothered mode unless you re white but the lady who served us was the exception to the rulebut what makes your experience different is the behaviour of the crew and quality of service esp in the economy class It s a shame really considering the perfect timing of the flight between Rome and Delhi headphone jacks broken system kept freezing staff very crude She even ate her meal on top of the bag and the crew said nothing However the airline ses to be running always late with not so good customer support both online and offline The food was bad the cleanliness none toilets good only for half of the trip odor horrible service only while takeoff food service and landing and the passengers most ofâ Flight time is very short as it s direct flight between new York to mumbai Flight attendants seemed to be not too happy doing their job The bag claim handling staff takes us aside and it is clear they are thoroughly disorganized Wish there was a direct flight The Air India employees asked all passengers to fill out delayed baggage forms and kept taking the forms as filled No airline can come near this experience that too from an state owned airline where generally a sense of ownership is lacking among employees Had a stopover in Mumbai that was originally 3 hours but flight times from Mumbai to Goa were changed which meant just over an hour to get next flight Air India help serve is horrible with navigating or helping you at all as well as with those at the air port Appears that food standard in Air India flight towards south India is definitely of not as good as in other sectors This moment an senior air hostess realized that there was a problem Day Flight no Jet lag My flight entertainement system didn t work from the take off whilst asking the flight attendant his reply was that he would reboot the system but didn t work until we landed Until the very end of the flight I didn t know where on Earth we were over literally Cabin staff is just not interested in you I sent a mail to customer care with proof and it never answered The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn t enough staff available to help Having missed our connecting flight due to being held up in the Immigration line in Delhi for 2 hours we had to rebook the next flight 6 hours after landing costing 550 00 2 pax paid 120 for original ticket Recently I had experienced worst ever service among all my trips with multiple airlines Air India planes are like 25 years old seats are terrible No touch screen entertainment no remote control works as they are very oldâ So the real test of an airline is how they respond to such issues The staff was not at all customer oriented The ground staff wasn t pleasant but ok Our first flight has only 1 hr transit Hopefully they will be bankrupt soon then finally also those miserable flights attendants might finally regret their attitudes towards customers What is the use of the Government issuing Charter of Passengers rights if the National Carrier violates all decent norms of attitude and obligations towards their passengers I tried calling Customer Support what a joke in the UK I was in a queue for 30 minutes and gave up my go air flight got cancelled and it was the only flight with seat s available on so kind of my only option My next flight I received my luggage back cracked my only concern was that the service was rather slow as it was already late in the night and by the time i gotThis was a Business Class flight to Spain and there was nothing Spanish toâ Cabin service was a typical example of government employees dedication cold food which they themselves would not care to eat very poor response to passengers genuine requests etc This is when our terror started now we were running around ticket counters to get rescheduled to next available flight as airindia staff s standard response no other flights are available we will rebook you for next day same flight and provide hotel stay however staff being older as compared to other airlines that is something goes negative for Air India for a 5 pm flight boarding began at 4 and we were asked to leave the aircraft around 7 pm in a transit lounge where it took the airline a couple of hours to clear us out since we were part of an international flight When I arrived in India one of the flight attendants was very calm and said Your plane has already left and I was so embarrassed and bewildered 5 Beverage service was not provided until hours into the flight and not enough They lied about being able to change the day of my flight home without a fee The food is good cabin crew helpful but there are no in flight services and the flight is always late Pilots made no announcements no appology for delay as well Grateful to be let on this flight but not one word of apology or any excuse from the Pilot on AI 215 for delay If it would have been some other cabin crew member they would have helped me even without me asking them to do so These air india people didn t allow to go to securityThere were too many confusing emails and messages on the schedule of this flight with varying times of departure As this is not a direct flight we had to change the flight at Delhi which was an International flight coming from Chicago Indigo is another such private company whose staff and crew have developed this arrogance Only the two longer flights had in flight entertainment In flight entertainment system did not work in my seat Staff simply don t care about passengers There are so many things wrong here no proper customer service even paid seats are not guaranteed one person works at the counters while the rest around 6 remain chit chatting despite a long passenger queue You can tell that Air India just don t care about service The rest of the flight was uneventful food is not great some staff appear to have some attitude that they are better than some of people on flight In fact we left Delhi 01 15 AM reached Washington 07 15 AM a flight time of about 16 hours only Unresponsive customer serviceHad issue with using air india format of name which had me call there online customer service three days in a rowNever have I experienced the mediocrity shabby service and sheer indifference that Air India offered Pathetic flight conditions terrible experience new flights are required as most of the seats are worn out and tv screens and remotes not working and also I had to wait for the flight staff to arrive to allocate the seat if any The landing of the flight was very rough This added on considerably to the flight time and we arrived into Paris three hours late You were horrible a decade ago and you will forever be horrible because your motto is not compassion in service your motto is scrutinize and demoralize older folks traveling alone I was not sure about the services and other facilities such as food i didnt had any sort of problem and the crew were supportive No in flight entertainment which is a big disappointment But I was not happy with their announcement service during flight The experience with the staff on my return flight was the same unfortunately In our first flight from Hyderabad to Mumbai left at 11 30 PM we flew all the way to Mumbai spent 1 2 hours in the air there and returned back to the Hyderabad airport at 3 AM because the flight had no place to land and apparently because of weather Due to many such customers with baggage missing finally managed to hold the point of contact have been informed that baggage left in origin destination due to confusion I will avoid traveling by this air line in future Later staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10 15 people going on the next flight 9 Return experience was also similar the customer care also seems to be untrained and they don t communicate well It is not that there the service was lacking but it was without character They only accept air india boarding card a nuisance But when you park the plane in the service area and not near the terminal and the passengers have to have a 25 min bus drive to the terminal this is not good customer service It was not my best flight but not my worst either as the kids were with us we had booked a flight to Changmai Thai Airways On Code sharing Basis via bangkok and with the regular delay in flight we were in the AirLousy flight lousier air hostesses I had to spend an extra night in Delhi as they changed my flight time and did not inform me I have heard a lot about Air India s not so good service I recently boarded Air India flight from Banglore to Hyderabad on arrival after waiting 1 hr on conveyor belt to collect luggage we found our luggage didn t arrive all our fellow passengers left after taking their luggage The agrevation of flying Air India is simply not worth it Air India is much better then Spice jet and jet airways but not very good flight Seat 19J entertainment system was not working seat 19K right hand handle was ripped and seat reclining was not working we raised this issue with air hostess she said she will look in to itAir India Business class flights consistently provide poor cabin maintenance cleanliness and service on every flight Plus the Air Hostesses are old some 40 plus and not polite Customer services also didnt disclose why flight duration increased by 5h The Air india flights are always late United representative was with me for 1 5 hrs on phone to accommodate my flight the Air India representative did not even want to talk to them on call The main flight from Kathmandu was 3 hours late therefore I missed my connecting flight from Delhi The cabin staff seemed not to care about what people brought onboard Passengers given airline food on a regular basis and plentiful We now know that entertainment on air india flights cannot be relied on so would definitely never use them again for a longhaul flightCheck in good no problems flight left on time seats a little cramped but ok as we are not the big The flight attendants only came around to pass food never responded to request about lighting or TV screen The in flight entertainment did not respond very limited entertainment options Boeing 787 TV was not working on my seat crewIt was good experience with air India on board although you have to really wait in long queues for boarding pass at airport and staff is also not that much good butThe AI staff at boarding gates were clueless and did not know what to be done Customer service representative conveyed wrong message I took the morning flight for Delhi as I had to go a long way to Noida Good experience on board but not that helpful customer care service prior to boarding Service was non existent and the FA gave off an interesting â IAir hostess are not liberal n servicing the drinks and food served has more bread and bread products and less of fresh fruit and salads instead Good service except the long queue at check in service which is always a problem in Mumbai due to the restricted counters for all the flights scheduled during the same period I would definitely fly Air India again on a long haul flight Business class The problem I had with this flight and the return on two weeks later was the lack of safety checks by the crew Customer care gave a number that also nobody picks up I actually took another airline from Kolkata to Varanasi because they were the only ones to have a direct flightThe Air India support staff at EWR TERRIBLE When I call customer service no one picks up end of it this flight s scheduled time was 9pm and left at 10 30pm unlike other airlines Air India hostesses does not make rounds of water and juiceAnd the ground staff at Delhi too many some have no work to do Birmingham airport air India desk not answering now The planes are filthy and the cabin crew so utterly disinterested itâ s shocking The staff in the business lounge did not think to advise the plane was boarding let aloneI think Air India needs to rethink this process I would never ever get on air india flight again and we wont do any more service It s a shame that AI is running such flights pretty soon no one would want to travel to India with this airlines Did the mistake of taking the direct flight from New York to New Delhi through Air India I took the early morning Air India flight AI 435 from Delhi to Bhopal on 09 May 18 and had a horrible experience in the bus located at gate 42 C of Delhi Airport As usual flight departed late One one occasion somehow the google data was showing delayed and when we tried to contact Air India we could not get through to customer care 5 this is a very long flight Itâ s an unduly long slow flight for a very short route primarily because of the aircraft they use the ones with the propellers I handed over 2 suspects but the Air India security manager in Hong Kong told me that on board security is not the airline s responsibility It s difficult to get assistance from the crews as you need to wait for a long time At a point of time we really thought that air hostess is handicapped and deaf Lousy service Extremely Costly even more than International Flight 2 hours is a long time without any access to in flight entertainment So guys don t get trapped in Air India trap of food and Hindi language Never got any response from customer service Some flight attendant service is not good Cleanliness 4 Lounge 3 food in lounge was a let down this was perhaps the Delhi airport small things like give the wifi password when the guest comes to the lounge would reduce the guest effort to go to counter again Air Hostess even don t care or bring something you asked We were travelling as a family from Mumbai to Delhi and had booked an air India flight expecting it to deliver a normal veg meal and a boring travel Departed 30 min late due to a passenger s emergency that held up the flight but made up time to reach Kolkata almost on time Due to their own flight delay on the first leg from Mumbai to Delhi we were told that the connecting flight to Sydney which was also an Air India had left and we would have to leave the next day My flight s scheduled time was 8 15AM and they announced that the flight will be delayed by one and half hour which was taken off after 3 hours suggesting them that you are the next after Indian Airlines When we told it to the air hostesses and stewards they did not say or addressed the issue anyway Also many times flights are not on time and needs improvement When we called customer service they asked us to pay a fee to be able to sit together and offered seperated by aisle air hostess flight attendants to pilots they lack any sense of enthusiasm to keep good acceptable standard of service We ve never had a TV on any of our Air India flights We had two flights outbound and two back with Air India in the course of the flights they did not manage to load our luggage so we were without any change of clothes for over 36 hours in tropical heat first ever domestic flight in India easy check in helpful staff always very courteous to my needs Food on board was disappointing only a veg option but overall I d repeat when required another botch job by Air India personnel put us on the 6 30 pm flightThe inflight entertainment was about three years out of date and a lot of the passengers were saying that the headphones were not working properly and when I triedThis was one of two internal flights with Air India both dismal I personally wouldnt want to go on this type of airline again Where we then had to pick up our bags and rebook ourselves onto the next available flight with Air India i purchased pre reserved seat service and amount was deducted twice for the same seats We asked for a spoon to the air hostess and she said we don t have any spoon later on she comes up with her great rude attitude with a glass or apple juice I called the customer support of Air India and nobody picking call When you board you feel you have boarded a bus not a plane the crew is indifferent as if they were put to work without theirmaybe the reason was it was an international flight that is why but end of the day it was just worth travelling on this flight Lethargic staff broken seat poor cleanliness pathetic in flight system and so on I booked this flight for my mother because itâ s a direct flight The planes look pretty tired and as a passenger I wonder if the cabin maintenance mirrors the mechanical maintenance ouch We didn t get any instruction from air line staff what to do next When we questioned the counter staff they never gave an honest answer They are providing gd service like tv music every thing in flight please go through Air India flights onlyThe in flight entertainment had a wide enough selection to make the trip feel short and I had requested at numerous counters at air India Mumbai for staff assistance for check in luggage as I have been asked to avoid picking up anything that causes exertion They cancelled the flight on the day I was supposed to fly didn t say any reason I called their customer service be ready to wait at least 30 minutes when you call there food looked awful and tasted very mediocre some flight attendants looked disgruntled and looked like they didn t get the memo on customer serviceThe aircraft was not very clean on the inbound flight ant not much selection on the In flight EntertainmentThe staff are mannerless and very impolite The check in staff the porters and the supervisors at Delhi were mostly corrupt I expected decent service for the Business class I had never travelled on Air India before and was a little apprehensive after having read several negative reviews of this airline Pros Great aircraft clean and maintained Timely service except last minute terminal change resulting in delay by an hour I purchased 5kg extra luggage in advance but to my surprise the staff said they don t have anything in their system and demanded that I pay 2000 rupees or remove 5kgs This is one of the longest flight 16hrs and you expect a comfort and these seats are nothing close to any comfort Have been flying Air India with the family mostly as the competitor air line was a nightmare Finally we took off only being treated to poor in flight service very bad food poor in flight entertainment not so clean aircraft The gap between evening flight and early morning connecting flight is so odd that for intervening period neither you can stay back at airport nor go to some hotel to take restNo empathy or customer care in Delhi One of the male crew member not wearing name tag was showing the attitude like he is obliging the guests 3 Had to call the customer care to get the seat booked that too wasn t a good experience After five hours of waiting a friend advised me to ask before everything for a place on the first flight In the future I will be much more careful not just on Air India flights Airline crew were very unhelpful and rudely spoken to us and elderly passengers were not able to stand for long Sadly the standard of this flight is starkly much below my first early experiences not what one would expect from Indiaâ s flagship today Dreamliner bought by Air India looks second hand as already broken monitor buttons and non reclining seats as itâ s always itâ s not changed in last 18 yrs same attitude of staff as no joy in doing the job expressionless face with bottled water which they were serving from 2 liter bottle to save money I presume On the counter when I asked about Mr Ashwin ex manager of Air India and my friend I was shocked to know that he passed away in heart attack at age of 42 RIP Meals are full of carbohydrates too salty and spicy not tasty rather unhealthy for such a long flight I will travel with this everytime for these points even though the flight time is odd Even upon calling their Customer Service Number in Bombay the time of departure was not clear The promptness of service was lacking Flight delayed slightly due to late arrival of incoming flight as if the airline is not accountable for that The promptness in service was lacking I asked for change of seat air hostess asks me to search a vacant seat on my own On a 12 hour flight the on board staff do not consider cleaning the toilets part of their job Could never imagine that such a thing could happen in an international flight Do not book on this airline as the service and the time management and the competence of crew and flight deck is questionable Once the plane the flight was unremarkable except Air India s flight manual appears quite different from most US carriers they put down flaps and gear 15 minutes before touchdown Not good enough Air India talk to your customers and keep them informed please Not a long flight but I was quite happy except for one very annoying thingNever ever take air India flight to go anywhere in the world On the 7th of June 2018 I boarded a flight to India Mumbai with a flight change in Mumbai and service was very poor On every other instance Iâ ve been indifferent to the service from Air India as there was really no differentiator None of the staff members were eager to help you Air India s flight was considerably cheaper when compared to others that too the only one to offer snacks alongwith Also they did not create paperwork hassles unlike Jet Airways wrt my mother s ticket who was discharged after hospitalisation and especiallyâ Despite various requests and attempts various cities FRONT OFFICE desks totally UNABLE TO REGISTER FOR FREQUENT USER card or number Iâ ll make it in a point form so itâ s easier to list the disasters Air India made on AI 343 1 Our ticket was labelled Discount Business and I certainly noticed that it was a notch down from usual Business Class eg limited drinks offering when boarding the plane We have sent numerous emails you can t call and speak with customer service and we re told in April they were investigating They informed Mumbai was just technical stop no change of flight and checking Plus flight attendants were not helpful at all It is a very long flight and with kids without TV We had to them plead our way on to the next air India flight to Lucknow from Delhi which was 6 hours later They informed that they will be able to accomodate us at 9 30 flight as the next flight at 7 30 was full Check in service at Delhi airport was pretty messy In flight experience was average the food was the worst Iâ d rather eat something at the airport and board As long flight itâ s quite inconvenient BUT the front office customer services is very much wanting Avoid booking this evening Air India flight from Kolkata to Agartala if you are in hurry or have meeting No In Flight Entertainment No serious complaints the seating was reasonable as was the service This is the most unbelievable customer service ever The crew never intervened to advise them to be calm I travelled on Air India flight AI 124 on 22nd June and my baggage wasn t checked out in time Delhi airport Air India line to check in 16 persons ahead of me 6 customer service agents working the ticket counter took more than one hour and 20 minutes When I asked refund as per policy Air India simply informed you were upgraded She was not well trained and was not good at customer service But as one of the flight attendants informed me owing to a glitch that program was not available on at least 200 monitors on the plane After reading the reviews online I consider myself lucky not to have experienced any delays a cancellation or a non functioning in flight entertainment system The journey was kinda good but the service was not the best no commmunication staff looks overwhelmed and disengaged As I was invited for a conference I did not have much choice in the selection of the flight Somehow cannot understand the beverage service 5 rude mannerless obnoxious and good for nothing airport staff they have no correct information ever Food certainly not business class standards cabin crew busy with everything else but serving the travelers Old aircraft no screen for movie emergency landing in Calcutta which happens frequently we find and 4 hours later on to New Delhi then they tell us we have to wait 24 hours for an onward flight It was a big waste of my money time and energy and the staff was not even apologetic even though it was an international flight no soft dink or anything cold or beer was served leave alone hard drinks There were very big negligence and irresponsibility on the part of the airlines and the way they were dealing with the customers But after some time one of the staff came and started apologising profusely This was my first and last experience of Air India and one I never want to repeat I was told even by their lady supervisor that I should not have done web check Because of the noise I couldn t make out what the crew said during their announcements On Air India s website it is mentioned that there is 50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours The shear lack of ignorance of Air India staff members was astonishing as they were unable to comprehend how he was able to get travel ticket from Delhi to Manchester withThey change the timing which causes so much down stream impacts and the customer service doesnt care about the impacts AND NON EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE I travelled on an air India flight after 10 years you would think the flights must have been upgraded or at least maintained but no There was no in flight entertainment And although their seat reservation opens 4 hours prior to boarding all the staff wants is for passengers to pay to get seats The ground staff at check in counter at IAD is the worst As regards general fitness of any flight attendant or air hostess I honestly believed that in case of emergency they would not be in any position to offer any help or comfort or confidence to passengers After mediocre service last year on BA to Kochi we decided to try Air India First flight with Air India was apprehensive as too many colleagues criticise them for always being late anything up to 3 hours recently Onething which I did not like in one of the trip is when something bad happens we had a storm once the staff at the airport do not give clear answers or tell us next steps On a ten hour daytime flight the in flight entertainment TV screen was not working Considering this has happened twice and friends have experienced the same thing if youâ re a tourist air India will book your flights very close together knowing youâ ll have to buy a new ticket never offering new flight options help or reimbursement for the flightBut they are nowhere to provide Even basic courtesy let alone services like the Star Alliance partners typically do After requesting 100times to the staff someone then tells you that it cant be fixed and for next 15 hours you have nothing to do The in flight experience was neither very good nor very bad Food aesthetics was not on Air India s list it looked as bland as the taste Having flown on Air India number of times I have come to expect these things its usually a hit or miss It s been 30 years since I last flew Air India and nothing seems to have changed There was no magazine this time and when contacted cabin crew staff said not available no one cares Not updated website lack of proper communication to customersAnd I doubt the vague reason given operational reasons is honest Would rate the whole experience 3 10 due to delays quality of food customer service and amenities offered loyalty air India show for its customers no airline can show because they always wait for there Passengers Though the customer service is not upto the mark for an International flight still we had a pleasant flight Your cabin crew could not give a toss they didnt serve pre booked meals when i inquired they informed that they didnt get any information from ground staff Even the staff is not ready to listen I guess only reason for me to have chosen this flight was the convenience of a direct flight from Stockholm to Delhi In flight entertainment ok no new movies Unfortunately this is the only advantage of this flight We came back business class which was terrible bad food surly flight attendantsI further challenged this customer service rep and asked how Air India thought it was acceptable to change my seats and have my children sitting elsewhere on the plane to which he answered apologies for any inconvenience Wanted direct flights from NYC to Mumbai so chose AIRINDIA another alternative was continental which was 400 more expensive The overall experience in a Dreamliner was made awful thanks to the cabin crew including one Mr Kanth can t remember his full name It was a mess at the airport with conflicting information on the take off and finally it took off after 17 hours resulting in one day hotel charges at Singapore without even staying Afetr the private airlines dominated Indian airspace in providing comercial service it was difficult to select Air India as choice of airline No in flight entertainment old long haul aircraft is used for domestic flights the AI staff who took the complaint was as complacent as he could be have mailed the pictures to the AI customer care Complain 6 times reboot by Air hostess but none of her effort works I even do not want to write please donâ t use their service The check in staff at Air India said nothing they could do one of our seats was broken The staff were pleasant the aircraft a bit scruffy and in need of refurb but overall good The Babudom still exists on time arrival is never their cupatea they don t believe in customer service The first flight I took on air India was years ago when they first started flying non stop to San Francisco but it took a me forever to book the free service while I reached airport and over the phone the day before my journey and I thought of meeting my friends during the huge gap between the connecting flights of Air India 6 hours The only flight from Jamnagar to Mumbai is AI 648 which is most of the time take off late Honestly I have never found such strange flight service no focus is made on customer services Even they should consider for international traveller changing to local flight should consider for one two kilo extra luggage I think it is not a bad airlines considering they are the only airlines in India that allows passengers to carry 25kgs the check in was very passed and by crude ground staff lacking any finesse The flight from Delhi to Leh was cancelled because of a technical fault in the aircraft which is definitely the fault of the airline and they re bound to compensate for the same WHile the air hostess knew it power failure she just kept mum and looked at me in disbelief almost as If I had destroyed it Whenever I have to travel I checks that yesterday this particular flight was departed on time or not The ground staff lacked capability to handle things efficiently but no staff was at boarding gate 51 until 10 45 am Flight attendants are not very helpful that s the only negative Contrary to what I heard about Air India this flight experience was far superior to other US based airlines that I had been traveling internationally in the past 19 years Without a doubt the worst airline I have ever flown on But by the time we finished our food the turbulence started and it continued till the time of landing at Indore Airport The in flight entertainment I just wish it wasn t there I understand things change and just to go with the flow but this air line has properly ruffled my feather and hence the review It s a big airline with no good customer care to have such a airline running The staff at the counter informed me that the incoming flight was bit delayed and the crew was on their way to this aircraft Quick thinking ground staff of the airline arranged for the baggage to be sent to Rajgot and then get it delivered to my hotel in dwaraka by a staff travelling four hours on road There is absolutely no customer service I would never book with Air India again due to the unprofessionalism unhelpful manner and unreliable service The food is ok but service is still not improved The only reason to travel by this is that it s a direct flight Otherwise the ground staff had given us couple middle seats in DIFFERENT rows when we had asked for aisle and middle seats When they finally pick up the customer service representative is of any help cannot be understood and has no other answer than you need to wait until they email back On the day of the flight when checking in we are told that the luggage will not go straight through to Lucknow No lounge in IXC for air India passengers I missed the train and had to go by air the next day and spent Rs 20 000 When we went to enquire regarding the same the staff us returned blank not reassuring mannerisms When Air India changed the time of our flight from Dharmsala to Delhi we had to cancel that segment and rebook with Spice Jet in order to make our connecting flight to Bodhgaya The crew had a medical emergency one hour into the flight and never bothered to take care of other passengers for a good part of the flight On our return flight the AI 282 on 30 Dec from Colombo to Delhi had meal choice not available despite the flight being only 70 full and the inflight crew did not have the decent courtesy to offer apologies for the same reflecting a complete disregard to customer service Friendly staff and no delay The customer service number in US is never manned So I would caution anyone on selecting Air India until their website is brought up to the basic standards of any other airline Service was very mediocre for business class I have never received more polite service from any other airlines in this matter The in flight entertainment will be regularly interrupted by PA announcements 23 times on this flight â This experience traumatised me as I was not aware that staff ought to be paid for providing this service There were some confusions on the flight home with our family four not being seated together I get a feeling of comfort on Air India flights like on no other If want a drink have to go and find one as very limited service to seated passengers They have the worst in flight service compared to any other international airline Red wine unavailable no scope for any repeat service but no much facilities which should be increase Later I had mentioned to Flight Attendants not to wake me for meals but only for tea or coffee and they did exactly that Pros why I will fly again its a direct flightAfter having heard negative comments of Air India flights I was thoroughly surprised during my recent flight to Jaipur Ground staff handling passengers at various stages don t think they are in a customer service industry it s not my one timeâ The air hostess started serving food and when she came to my seat told me Non veg is over now you will get only veg What a way to put it across Plus was a direct early morning departure and BLR airport wasnâ t busy Inflight service and cabin crew attitude has improved tremendously but the overall service is still needs improvement but as it s a direct flight it doesn t really matter One of the washroom was out of service due to which there was a lot of inconvenience No dinner served on a dinner flightSo in this particular flight from Delhi to Chennai I forgot my Kindle on my seat Conclusion was air india doesnt fit to operate international flights I have used Air India a few time over the years for internal flights when visiting India when we got on the Flt we find out the Flt was not that full and the flight attendant was able to sit is together every thing was good but while returning from Madrid to New Delhi I found some difference in the food they served which is not as expected and also the air hostesses were a bit negligent Average service with no inflight entertainment PLEASE DONT TRAVEL USING AIR INDIAThis is absolutely unacceptable for an international flight paying the full ticket price Why I book this flight when I was having option of many international flights in same price Finally the flight was moved on but again due to some snag noticed by the pilot it was moved back to parking with any information to passengers Finally we have a direct flight from Copenhagen to Delhi with a total flight time of 7 hours What was heard about the Air India services seems to be incorrect Can t believe the changes Air India went through Passenger next to me was not feeling well and the attendant offered to get some medication After having very bad experience with Indigo I do always try to purchase ticket of Air India Next the very rude and uncaring attendants who were being shouted at by all passengers especially the European and American passengers the attendants have no idea that they are providing service because they were disinterested uncaring and answering back to every passenger who had a problem which the flight had plenty Air India is the only Airline that goes to my hometownThe crew was extremely unfriendly and snooty to western customers The crew in Air India are not that young due to the personnel policy of this government Airline so apparently they are also not very dedicated to their jobs as you find in the private Airlines The flight was Jam Packed but took off on time and the Experience efficiency of the staff was visible by the way how they could manage the passengers to get seated on time for take off Communication while in the air was lacking Not only will they not live up to their obligations as a member of Star Alliance and not only will they not even supply me with the details of my return flight eticket number seat number flight number Never seen this kind of service Ultimately we reached Delhi 2 5 hours late without a word of apology from the flight crew and incorrect information about the baggage belt None of the TVs worked in rows 30 32 across all seats in spite of repeated resets by the crew Cabin crew ended up being apathetic An internal flight on Air India is one of lifeâ s biggest challenges My suggestion to airline is that customer should able to contact customer care lines easily Close to 360 passengers were made to sit for 2 hrs in a flight and final asked to disembark after diff employees the air hostesses the crew at the entry and a ground staff member gave us diff responses about leaving time But again the touch down will still make me opt for an AI flight no matter how the rest of the services offered are no meal options no booking managementAt the time of landing the plane was so shaky many of us thought that this is our last flight Air hostess had no manners how to speak The crew are loud and do not take care of their customers Cannot say how much a cancellation of a flight from Shimla to Dehli distrusted our travel and start of our holiday in India Cabin crew with very little experience and did not properly communicate It was my first time flying Air India and definitely not my last Staff could not show customer focus No one cares about cleanliness respect for others and everyone brings more than allowed limit of hand luggage and trying to insert in any open slot and arguing with the cabin crew worst behavior I had to stop in Mumbai and take another flight to Kochi I was coming from international flightThe Air India flight was scheduled for 10 50 a m and we were apprehensive whether it will ever take off in this inclemental weather I should expect a good will gesture of part refund for this flight No service from this airline I m travelling all time too air India flight The flight took off after a delay of about 45 minutes we were made to sit in the aircraft with no AC Staff at the check in counter was also highly uncooperative Even though very less number of passengers travelling with us but overall Flight infrastructure is good My previous experience of flying with Air India was not good Yet about 8 Business class revenue seats were cordoned off as a crew rest area When I planned my US trip I thought of taking air India as recommended by my travel agent and offcourse I knew I was expecting too much NB I do not think there is any good quality airline is left now anymore in this age of competition roaring expenditure and high expectations Only thing lacking was in flight entertainment and seats are comfortable for 2 hour travel time Our departure from Kathmandu was delayed due to delayed arrival of high profile travelers to New Delhi Air hostess held it for some time before moving the passengers to a different seat with not such a re assuring remark that if the oxygen starts coming out we could be in danger NO entertainment service Dead monitors USB ports are literally broken None of the 3 entertainment systems worked despite being rebooted Boarding delayed by 30 minutes no reason given delayed further finally after boarding completed plane didn t move and on asking crew they informed shortly there will be an announcement which indeed happened informing that there is a technical snag and will be rectified shortly since they have been able to trace the same finally repair was over now refuelling announcement switch off electronic gadgets at last plane started moving with a delay of 90 minutes requested for tea when repair was on flatly denied though this was a international flight overall experience of a huge aircraft was extremely poor and made us feel afraid all the time The flight departed 45 minutes late which disturbed no crew member Air hostess never listen to you Neither my travel agent nor the Air India staff had advised me that I would need a Singapore transit visa to collect my bag and connect to JetStar shoddy unhappy cabin crewNo one in Air India knows where to deposit the luggage for the connecting Air India Flight Received SMS to report Check in Counter 4 hours before the schedule departure of our AI Flight AI 103 at 01 15 hrs Day time flight but in between meals no service at all For what it cost a tip top flight everything on time service a bit erratic but friendly we would fly them again and the food was good The only time we saw the crew apart from embarkation and disembarkation was when they swiftly frisbee d our meals out to us In flight entertainment not much choice on international film English Hollywood movies although there are one handful movies available and good choice This is such unbelievable behavior by staff of a Star Alliance airline However those original assigned seats which I got with the help of an agent in their own office were given away with no warning I was robbed from my wallet mid flight from New Dehli to Hong Kong and the Air India staff couldn t care less New flights were Â 500 more does it seem unreasonable that this is not good service The pilots were experienced so the flight landed with a little jerkMy observation about the Crew serving and attending passengers is that they do not seem to be satisfied or happy doing their job Finally the flight left at around 0100 and till that time the passengers were not served anything On landing at Madurai the Air India bus which took us to the terminal was not air conditioned and had very little seating They do not care about their customers at all we booked 2 sets of flights in order to watch the Ipl but the matches were changedAI is legendary for its lack staff delays and lack of respect for its passengers No good service Standard food no TV screens so no in flight entertainment They also weren t the full pods which I have seen in other business class international flights so you didn t have quite the same privacy As we had also booked internal flights to Kerala it left us having to rebook for 24 hours earlier and paying for an additional night in Delhi The air hostress weren t much friendly they seem have some other worries they don t respond to the call button as well If you cannot provide a service do not offer it Thank God my flight to Moscow was at night but still the company Air India delayed flights made me jittery and cause discomfort only for one flight No pleasant staff at all he did not know anything about the service he was providing secondly when i called backâ Air India flight have Large leg space free meal world class service upto 25 kg of luggages in domestic flight more than others airline When we get on flight we were told that those seats were assigned to another passenger and asked us to go talk to air hostess also we found out this is not direct flight to EWR getting stopped in Ahamadabad Jamnagar Mumbai they provide only refreshments which is poor calling them Full service carrier Bathrooms were clean and the only thing true in all the other reviews was the unfriendly staff The service was pleasant and quick and food was OK not brilliant so no complaints But each segment I took the clear differentiator was service maybe it was business class factor maybe lower number of people sitting in the B class I certainly would not turn down the offer of Business Class again if offered but would try and get onto a different airline if I could There is no love or dedication to the company from its own employees Why I am sharing this experience is that still our Indian Air Lines are the best in their service comparison with others where adjustments nd understanding the passengers is concerned Really worth using this airline as its a direct flight and no hassles of getting off and going thru all the customs checks again Like many I had some concerns regarding Air India but to be honestI had to ask for a pillow the crew didn t give them out The aircraft looked not maintained well EnoughNo Customer Service Never in my fetch able memory I can remember an AI flight started before time When one air hostess was just passing through I asked her if she is not supposed to see the signal which is lit for 15 min the plane is small with 3 by 3 sitting please note at present airbus fleet of Air India does not have in flight entertainment so if booking air India better is to check the plane being used on that segment With only one thing that they should one and agiant think of having old age air hostesses I have never seen old age air hostesses other than air India They did have full AC charging but no in flight wi fi on my service The TV monitors and service was out of order much of the time on both legs â Though flight was delayed by 3 hrs but cabin crew handled situation well No ground crew to advise Air India is always a late comer kind of an airlines across all sectors whether iit would be domestic or International Air India s onboard service has definitely gone down lover the years Cabin crews were not smart enough how they shoiluld be very casual attitude On top of that the Customer Care did not pick up the phone and their website did not allow a seat preference before that When I landed at my final destination the baggage never arrived no staff is available to enquire No proper service and also no response from Air Hostess Well It s not first time i traveled in Air India flights Not so courteus crew but no on my flight back from New Delhi to San Francisco the same scenario the crew apologized for the system being down They are always the cheapest option available and I can forgo some service for a cheap flight I was not helped by the cabin crew they were not even visible Despite bring a Government Airline Air India service on ground on air is better than MOST private airlinesThis is the best way to get to Pune from here without the hassles of changing flight in Delhi Mumbai Next on a 15 hour flight the crew never offered Coffee Tea except the occasions of lunch dinner the quality of service is nowhere close to other business class on the return journey I asked for the food menu and after 2 mins I received a photostat black and white print though it has improvedNO flight entertainment of course except for the staff chatting behind closed curtain when not asleep Lift your game Air India as there is plenty of cheaper and better airlines occupying the same routes The outbound overnight business class was in my view poor and Iâ m not fussy or pretentious about it just wanted a decent service and be able to sleep When i asked the air hostess to help me with my seat she asked me figure it out myself Another ai flight from VIE to DEL this time with a motivated crew the movie selection is very limited but the seat pitch levels that I don t think i will choose this service in future Air hostesses were tying to help through making some seat adjustments to no avail Full refund received after a few weeks but no compensation and no help with getting a new flight Iâ ve often been party to the jest we make of some of the air India staff weâ re so awkwardly cliched to expect young good looking guys and girlsOnboard service is quite basic and the crew lack interest I was not ver sure of the quality of service on this airlineCabin Crew They have a poor attitude towards the guests and appear to be highly untrained to be in the airliine serviceâ In spite of the terrible reviews people give Air India s flight 701 on that day was on time and sufficiently pleasant I have flown roughly 25 different airlines now to over 30 countries and never in my lifeThe passengers were more than willing to help them out but the cabin crew was not making any efforts to help or clear confusion Can t believe such was the state of the 787 Dreamliner in service to New Delhi truly filthy They one of their staff to assist me WHO WAS NEW and doesnt know ANYTHING planes and flight crews very good overal except that the video monitors didn t work for the entire middle section of the plane for 17 HOURS return trip did get back to chicago after a mid flight diversion to STOCKHOLM May be the freshness what we observe in private airlines or the missing of new look of upholsteries not very sure to pinpoint Found staff to be indifferent and not in any way customer friendly Between the services they just disappear to the back of Air Craft Seat space was minimal the in flight entertainment basic and inaudible and the cabin crew remote unfriendly and disinterested I am hoping I am not tempted to the convenience factor of flying directly to Delhi in future using Air India However there is no other choice as they are the only airline flying this route Wonder what kind of maintenance is done on this airplane if they donâ t have time to fix broken airplane This so called service of that government airline is poor and more than disappointing I did not obtain a direct flight from Mauritius to New DehliAir India service on flight is at par with the best sadly the ground staff have ruined this beautiful airline created by a master JRD Tata The crew amenities space food etc are brilliant nothing comes even close to this airline when it comes to service class Air India had a very nice flight from Heathrow to Mumbai that we took because we had a UA mechanical in Denver missed our nonstop connection in EWR and rerouted through LHR to BOM The staff is not at all courteous to even help you out with a solution and have a don t care attitude The longer flights had nicer seats the shorter flights had basic seats that were a bit more used and not as comfortable The airline is a public sector airline and the only good thing is leg space in economy class plus luggage allowance Crew They did not seem to particularly enjoy doing their job Food service ambience is lowest in the class It is all the more noteworthy since the airline is in all sorts of financial problem but the staff did not get distracted and focused on customer service The United States is a premier destination and onboard services should have been the best So never spoil your holidays with such airline Even water or tea is available only through self service One time when we finally got some answers the flight attendant wasn t the most helpful in any way quite the opposite while I had informed him that I may miss my connection I read all the reviews about unfriendly staff bad hard seats dirty interior never on time etc My advice even if you get good service with air india business dont take it Onboard food provided by this particular flight is awesome for this below 2hours flight Despite the CRPF already put a stamp on the boarding pass another by the staff is mandatory and best partWhen I contacted their customer support all they said was they apologise for any inconvenienceThe only thing good was it was 40 cheaper then rest of the airlines When flying 8 5 hours in a pretty new aircraft Dreamliner it should work This is annoying as you are standing in line to get checked in and ready for long flight ahead My first impression of the Air India lounge at Heathrow was not good I paid good money for a business class ticket and the Air India lounge in Rome has not been efficiently cleaned You also feel their lack of customer mindset at check in and in the lounges purely mechanical and service in Lounges is absolutely minimal The best part of this airline is that it cuts 6 7 hours of fly time if going from SFO to Delhi which is huge The only drawback is poor internal aircraft maintenance on brand new beautiful Dreamliner aircrafts not good taste crew membes have not good service in flight some we requier water tea coffeeSo obviously this is in no way a good airline for a business trip I think in short trips why AI serves food not necessary at all may be that s one of the reason for AI loss â overall good flightI thought that it was incredible that thought the staff knew about the glitch it had not been fixed before the plane took off but said nothing There was no issue with check in and boarding the staff behaved well and there was a serving of tea coffee with cakes biscuits and sweets all at free of cost which we missed badly during our return flight by Indigo Airlines i get a nice travel experience but its service was not that type of nice air india have to improve there services and they have to buy new aircrafts they have old style aircrafts This airline is disrespectful unclean and do not have any knowledge of good customer service 4 Add a positive attitude to flight service the crew ignored calls for service between meals and seemed not to enjoy serving people Fortunately as we are flying executive class we could able to get a flight for 8 15 pm to Kolkata but rest of our friends were not that lucky and stayed back for the following morning departure Then the pilot did a great job with a short and almost unnoticeable take off non smiling faces n rude and inefficient they managed to miss serving food to some passengers i was one of those and they actually never noticed it until i told them so service was very shoddy at best The only good thing about Air India is that they offer the passengers to carry some extra luggage with them Finally it was a dinner flight and perhaps I was more exhausted and sleepy than hungry and hence did not find the rice with paneer in it and dal meal though servedWhen I returned from Mumbai to udaipur flight again delayed 3 hours again what a beautiful delayed serviceThe attitude of staff was amazing as they were not ready to give additional drinking water to the me The flight staff were amazing nothing was too much trouble and the food was lovely As ever the most annoying part of travel in SpiceJet cropped up during webcheckin I had to pay for webcheckin since the airline forces you to pay for choosing a seat When I boarded flight first surprise should I say disappointment was that the push back mechanism on the back rest was broken so my seat was was always leaning backwards Starting from the check in i was asked for upgrade to forward of the plane with extra charge ofcourse boarded the plane only to find out that the rows of seats behind me were of extra legroom We sat on the seat allocated and was looking for flight entertainment there was non extra legroom But in seat above of us folding table tray was missing i have traveled in SPICEJET twice earlier to this particular flight but this time we found that cooling AC was so very less that including myself many other passengers were trying to check if the vent for air flow was not proper while the aircraft was at base in short cooling was not up to the mark as expected from any airline They were in a hurry to fly so were we but cared the least about the comfort of the passengers Something very annoying about Spicejet in recent days is that you are forced to buy a seat during web checkin else you have to go to the airport for checkin They have more no of rows to accommodate more passengers resulting in cramped leg space Legroom is terrible so congested airline customer service is also awfulBut we two were left alone to struggle with these seats as we were modest in raising our objections Stressful legroom badBut I could only get seat 31 and that a middle seat which I always avoid We had been given the most annoying seats There seats were dirty and bad smell in the entire cabin Seats and covers have holes and look like there could be bugShe has been refused boarding and been made to rebook her seat at an inflated price She denied saing there were no seats available When I got into the WC I was seated doing my business when all of a sudden a loud and violent banging started on the WC door No legroom whatsoever and food was terrible dreadful food uncomfortable seats poor service late take off on all legs dirty aircraftTo think we paid more for these uncomfortable seats makes me cringe with dissatisfaction and a feeling of being cheated by the airlines The seats are so narrow and it is really disgrace So the airline does everything they can to push you to pay for the seats even for middle seat a little noise but expected been a propeller airplane I got a middle seat both times and width of the seats and leg space were terrible Staff had zero empathy and was getting offensive when questioned why was wheel chair passenger not boarded first I was told by their crew donï ½t teach us how to do the boarding The flight with the worst legroom This person sat behind me and he scream and hit the seat all the way until we landed and there were children on the flight but there were no controls children running up and down the aisle climbing on seats as the flight was not full people moved around and then kicked off when their food was eaten by the people who moved into the vacated seat I was given the worst seat on the flight perhaps because I refused to upgrade to Spicemax when the company called me 3 days earlier the take off was really very smooth the whole time everything was smooth at the time of landing it was shaking as soon as the tyres touched the runway because of the speed or the runway was bad massive turbulence felt it scared all the passengers but we were safe And since they delay the flight and immediately board the flight with next lot of passengers the seats are not cleaned properly and the pockets are left with empty glasses and bottles and leftover food packets of previous passengers Worst were the seats The seat was not comfortable and the pocket on the seat in front was broken so that I had to wedge the flight magazines between the seat and my knees to prevent it digging in me my wife pocket was also broken but not as bad The toilets were really bad badly repaired with feviquick glue and all seats almost falling apart andI was unimpressed by all the hidden charges when I booked these flights and disgusted when I went to check in online to find that I could only do that if I PAID for the seats they refused to give me a better seat and shifted me to another seat of the same kind no compensation for their terrible service and comfort At least seats were clean mostly because of no food or drinks being served unless paid for The flight was around half hour late and the seats really bad we have wasted our lots of time on Spicejet customer care in Goa and also flight conditions are also bad continuous noise terrible journey The worst was that the two seats given to us were non reclining seats and the check in staff told me that they are reclining seats Not so much of noise A passenger standing in que just in front of me didn t know how much foreign currency he suppose to carry but the way they behaved and commented which is a shame for them Staff is courteous but seats are bad legroom is bad The seat arrangement is horrible and to add to it the plane is so oldEverytime passengers created noiseI was in two minds to take 3 different free seats and allow my daughter to be seated with someone else First of all if you want to do a web check in then every seat apart from the middle ones are Paid At one point I was so irritated with the constant banging on my seat from behind I rose up from my seat and unleashed a few choice words to the gentleman seated behind me If they could ignore a seat in a row that they sell as spice max Its very disappointed and disturbing for other passengers for seat adjustment Seats were in really bad condition I feel really annoyed because web portal has only provision of selecting tickets if you are willing to pay between 100 to 1000 INR else your seat will be middle seat last few rows Seats had dirty hand prints His friends were so intoxicated that they probably didn t realise just how much noise they were making Worst there s just no legroom in this exit row 2 seats on each side While doing my web check in I was shocked to see that I have to pay extra for EVERY seat save for some middle seats even basic cabin safety wasn t carried out and it looked like the crew didn t want to ask people to put away tray tables and recline seats back to the seated position Due to low passenger load they decided to cancel their afternoon 1pm flight and force the passenger to opt for a 7pm flight I grudgingly paid Rs 200 for the aisle seat and Rs 99 for the middle seat that was the only way I could do the web check in The worst part is that they kept most of the seats as paid during online check in so you will have to part of the long queue at the airport The seats are uncomfortable and leg room absolutely mimimal The entire aircarft was full of such cases couples and families separated because every seat except the middle seat is paid We were alloted seats 1E and 1F however those seats were the worst Due to noise i feel pain in my ears after completing my journey The passengers who pre booked their meal but were seated beyond the row 10 had a real struggle getting the meal in time we travelled from bengaluru to mumbai economy may 2017 but the seats are stuck either they dnt recline or get stuck every flight which i took was with some complaints like recently i opt for max spice and paid for three seatsI was assigned 27D a seat that had a non reclining back so straight and a seat that was so cramped that my neckï ½The interior in dark grey upholstered seats and cream wall looked slightly dull In fact so much so that window and aisle seats 1A and 1 B are even less spacious then the economy seats We paid for seats in row 3 and ended up in row 1 with loads of legroom not sure how or why There were some particles lying in the seat which had to be dusted off and removed Seat were torn 2 I argued for almost 15 min that why to pay extra when I opted for normal seat and how come seats can be filled when i bought a tkt This seat should not be categorized as SPICE MAX there is nothing MAX about these seats infact was worse than regular seats A big argument arose and a staff arrived asking us to change seats my friend refused stating we were first in the check in counterSeats are extremely cramped and legs start aching on a 2 hour flight The booking was done through Cleartrip as they were not charging for seat middle one while Spicejet website booking charges for middle seat As a result I have developed a stiffness in my lower back by adjusting to the narrow space between seats non recline seats even though at the time of selling they book this for my younger daughter who is 15 yrs old but in flight at the time of check in they denied for max seat and ask me to call toll free for complaint so that is also not in good support in all my payments are wasted also in flight during entire flightSpice jet seats are worst among all economy class airlines Airline ignored the data provided by us and we got the seats in same row lots of leg roomï ½I could stretch out my legs and was comfortable even when the person sitting in front tilted their seat back Seats were damaged The seats in front of me was broken hence could not be put upright I don t have a problem with you charging extra but if someone arrives at the check in counter early enough when paid seats are unoccupied assigning seats to members of a family separated by 10 rows is extremely apathetic BOMBARDIER flight had a delayed take off the cabin noise was high and the aircraft looked old Seating was not comfortableNext time I was travelling from Delhi to Mumbai the cabin temperature was very low I said if I am not provided with a blanket I will deplane I was immediately given two blankets But I do receive all the useless msg by this airline like upgrading your seat discounts or booking meals etc a big NO if you guys need proper legroom either you should be short or you should be happy with whatever space you will get when the person sitting in front pushes the seat back then your legs will get jammed The cabin crew or captain did not bother keeping us informed of what s happening even during worst turbulence and AC failure They Cheated us while travelling from kolkata to portblair and asked extra money for the seats that we have already selected while booking It is extremely difficult to manage all of this in a narrow seat with a paper backed tray When I did get on this airline the seats were uncomfortable and the planes old very little leg room and very small seats compared to the other low cost carriers the aircraft was jerking almost through out the journeyThere were no free drinks or food on the plane unless you upgraded your seat The only problem with spicejet is very less legroom and they are littlebit down in the cleanliness Paid for the seats through the website and somehow the screen went blank Even though there was an announcement on turbulence in the middle she didn t allow people ever after several minutes Seats were very low quality gap between the seats were very narrow Being its a economy class flight seat he woke me up and started giving actions asking me to pull my seat front kind of he owns the aircraftPaid extra for spice max till jammu but did not get spicemax seats from delhi jammu sector after pointing out to the air hostess was told that it will be sorted out once u land in jammu at jammu airportI was sitting on 1A and had to change the seat immediately upon take off Despite it they did not give me anything to eat or drink which was offered to other passengers seating next to me I wish the seats had little more leg room because it is very inconvenient for the passenger on the middle seat It feels like extreme vibrations during fly for few times cause of outside weather I face legroom issue with all airlines but SpiceJetWe got the seats in front of the emergency exit which meant an extremely cramped seat with nonexistent legroom Check in by web apps is available however i have to pay for some amount to be able to check in i forgot if its for the seat or anything else but since can t connect to my ibankingI would suggest not to travel in this type of aircraft due to very high level of turbulence noise There is no space for the legs to accomodate Torned seats push back not working Seats are too narrow and uncomfortable for a decent size man They make you pay for Spicemax for extra legroom priority boarding and terrible meal on the plane and don t oblige to the privileges Our seats were surprisingly cramped my seat back tray table was broken the seat pocket was torn and it was dirty Spacing between the seats was too less for a person like who is short felt the pain Despite opting for the first row extra legroom seats it was a cramped experience Because seats are too close to each other Ultimately got a middle seat they just gives you tickes not allocating seats even neither gives any information about luggage or checkin rules or their so called process because they want to loot you The little reclining that economy class had has been removed for want to add more seats I guess Took an hour of waiting just to have us board the flight sending passengers in rows of 10 s and the ones boarding last had seats in front but had to cross the entire aircraft to store overhead luggage Talking about inflight stuff the seat room wasn t adequate even for a spicemax Jet Airways provide better leg roomThe only option that is available for you while doing web checkin is obviously the middle seat of every row and why would 2 people traveling together book 2 seats in different rows They should allow passengers with kids to choose seats together even if they are towards the end When I saw my seat there were bits of paper lying on my seat The seat in front of me was so close that I could not stretch my legs or sit upright without my knees touching the front seat The seats on the flights are getting smaller almost no leg space very less seat recline I flew some domestic flights with no seat recline shoulder space is alse very bad My heart jumped into my throat when we faced a turbulence from Calcutta to Dhaka in the month of August i will never fly this airline even if they offer seats for cheap Seats were tightly packed with little leg space Here is what surprised me More the seat next to me was empty We were allocated emergency exit seats which were absolutely tiny with no legroom and no space to evacuate in case of an emergency And when the passenger in front tries to lean back on his seat it s literally in your face Over and above this the life jacket in the flight was removed from one of the seats If you donï ½t pay for baggage in advance then it may cost the same amount as you have paid for your seat I always buy a spicemax seat for the extra legroom front row and was seated in 1F When we entered the Aircraft the seats we requested were empty and no one was sitting in the seats I tried to deal with the ads on the seats by keeping my eyes closed as much as I could and reminding myself that this was a manipulation attempt whenever I did open my eyes and see the advertisement but every fifteen minutes for the entire 2 1 2 hour flight they would come on the speakers and make some announcement about their brand ending it with thank you for choosing brand I was not able to pull up the seats during take off when i informed the crew about this they laughed and said no problem you will not fall down Not adequate seating space for tall people I had to ask the passenger in front of me to straighten her seat during landing No one should be denied of this basic human function especially when you paid money for you flight seat which includes the right to use the washroom if I can get my wife to sit there and got same reply that the flight is full didn t understand how was any1 getting on that seat now since the boarding had finished and captain had ordered for the doors to be closed I believe itï ½s not common to allot seats at emergency exit people with infants We were their Priority Customers but we have not given such treatment and in Breakfast they do not have even varieties of Juices to serve and our seats were in front but no space to keep your hand luggage which they have accommodated somewhere elsebut whenever I am flying with Spicejet there s always an issue with the air pressureSeat recline was about 120 degree not bad for economy class Rating 3 5 On the second flt to Bangalore we were again seated in non SM and they managed to get one of us into more legroom seats I did manage to get a seat near the emergency exit as it was empty I opted for Spice Jet for my Goa trip disappointed by their seat space economy class always is shrinked I know that but my flight was even worse and choked me for 2 3 hours But charging extra for all seats for online checkin makes it cumbersome On the top of that the reading light focused onto my seat was not workingAlso in the cabin not every seat had the airline magazine mine didn t We feel that we are trapped in seat Good budget flight on time economy seats are not great very ordinary SpiceJet seats are two narrow for comfortable sitting and the bulk head space is not adequate enough I feel this is the reason these guys couldn t fill seats even though the price was less One more thing i have noticed in this flight is that the air pressure in the cabin is less as compared to when i travelled in indigo flight and this is good as i did not feel much pain in my ears which was severe in case of indigo Found the airline penny pincher 100rs for printing your boarding pass 800rs for front seats are more expensive than airline fare But when I asked at the counter for a seat with leg space to my surprise I was told that I have to pay extra for that which I did not really like it and was also not informed at the time of booking Even though in the front seats most of the passengers were travelling with patients they could not use the toilet when required But on the first row leg space was less than a normal seat and you could not stretch your legs as the partition restricted the space I have paid upfront for food and the seat which costed me Rs 1798 the legroom was not as much as other economy airlines because of the placement of the divider The online staff claimed that the seats were already allotted and we had no choice to request the staff to change to row 2 of the aircraft as recommended by the Airline staff online The seats were uncomfortable and unfortunately my seat had a problem in reclining backJust after landing the parent got up to take something for the kid from and the crew asked him to be seated Although their check in was expedient they charged us more for an extra bag than a seat on the actual airplane Seats are pretty narrow and there is not much legroom The web check in didn t give me the option of choosing a seat for free I would conclude that service provided to me was pathetic in terms of seating non reclining seat even upon requesting spending my 2 hoursThe seats seemed to be a bit tighter than on our previous flight and the cabin crew a bit more up tight The seat back rest wasn t working we had to pay for a meal and our seats together this resulted in a more expensive flight that expected beforehand since we didnt get seats together though we were travelling as a family When the passenger front of me reclined all the way back I didnï ½t get claustrophobic I was able to straighten my legs almost completely through the footrest under the seat in front of meWhile 1D 1E and 1 F which were better seats were not allotted to us by the Airline as they claimed the seats were already booked The worst part of SpiceJet is that I have never found it easy to check into the flight online hours ahead of the flight without any payments for the seats person at Seat No 7A pushed his seat backward and put me to a lot of discomfort all through out the Journey Not a great experience in this flight check in is very slow always some issues seats are cramped not much of leg spaceDisappointingly on our outward flight there was a duplication of seat numbers with someone seating in our seats when we got there When we arrived at our seats there were other passengers claiming these were theirs and it turned out there were quadruple bookings for the same seats small 40 seat plane felt like a crowded small bus congested space very small loo expensive snacksLast seat in different row with no leg room and no seat push up Once we boarded the flight we found out that the air con is not working or there was minimal circulation of air in the flight which was packed with passengers There s hardly any seat which is given free when you do the web check Seats were cramped Plane was OK but hardly any legroom Rest all the seats were chargeable On reaching the airport well in advance the ground staff at the airport offered us two front seats on their own saying that the seats at the back are not together and that the front seats are more comfortable etc Cramped seats no tv and pathetic boarding experience The seats are really small But I was told to pay for the seat if I want to change as if they will pick up a passenger in the middle of the air and this was an issue with the airline and not us so we remained at our seats All of Spice Jets Boeing 737 jets have seats that are 33 inches from the back of one seat to the one in front The seats were uncomfortable had enough legroom and the flight was not smooth during takeoff or landing and this was an issue with the airline and not us so we remained at our seats Other passengers had the same issue and it must have taken a good 30 minutes to have this dealt with When we arrived in Delhi 3 of our 4 luggage had the priority label but the fourth did not so we had to wait for about 15 minutesFlight was pleasant though we faced a little turbulence given the weather on that day It has no leg space and the seats are so close to each other and it is all so cramped When I got back to my seat as soon as I sat down a pilot or co pilot cane out of the cockpit in haste and went straight to the WC where I had been seats were really congested I have travelled 3 times with them either their seats are with dirt or the fabric facing our seat is like that The seat was a tad bit uncomfortable and I really got the coach travel feels from it Seats are uncomfortableSeats were not great no inflight entertainment We could not even stretch our legs even a bit infact normal seats we could have stretched legs under the front seats All seats is not comfortable small leg space The leg room is invisible seats are choked up together On our return we did again ask for the same seats row 1 D E and F as we were not at all comfortable with the bulkhead seats in our flight from Hyderabad Like they allocated seats I didn t choose with a fees This attempt is made in a very dishonest way by claiming that the flight is full even if you are at the airport 2 3 hours before departure and a seat close to the front of the aircraft is not available Also the tray holder is fixed in the seat so sitting space is very less too No legroom and Will not recommend any one The Boeing 737 800 seat configuration that SpiceJet has provide poor front leg space The mechanism did not work we could not recline the seats and therefore were not as comfortable as was expected They used old aircraft with no effort to rectify seats and improve service The snacks we received being in SpiceMax seats were flung at us not even handed to us Seats were not comfortable This attendant was not so happy with me switching seats God know why and while she was telling me about moving back to designated seatThere is pretty less legroom on the other seats Flight was untidy seats were uncomfortable There is no space for passengers in row 1 to store computer ladies bag below the seats in front because there are none you can even upgrade from economy class to spice max in the plane or at the check in counter if the seats are available We made a wise decision by opting for SpiceMax class seats of the flight in the front and thus got seats with better legroom than the other economy class seats in the plane any consideration or announcement to board the wheel chair passenger first as a result of this my mother who has severe challenges to walk was made to board in the last and had to walk through the aisle with fully occupied rows where it is impossible to walk in this air craft without any assistance The in flight experience was as usual very tight seats with very little legroomThe seats are cramped offering very less space to move ypu just have to sit in one position all the time which is not quite possible in flights beyond 2 3 hours The departure Gate changed there were no announcements everyone struggled to get their cabin baggage in place some hid theirs under their seats despite orders to the contrary Well he did not let me shift from an normal centre seat to the next aisle seat in spite of the aircraft carrying not even 50 load No announcements during in flight turbulence and AC failure We booked our return flight at a short notice and managed to get four seats Fourthly after we had taken our respective seats in the aircraft and after boarding was complete we found that a seat next to one of our seats was vacant All Spicejet flights including this one had a turbulence Only problem faced when I tried to web check in they have only paid web check in seats which management should look into seats are not so comfortable Seats are too cramped As we entered the flight no one was there to help us to make my mom sit in seat I only struggled to do that Adding to the woes my seat wasn t even reclinable and my friend was annoyed and ask that we go first When we arrived at our seats there were other passengers claiming these were theirsseat space a liitle too narrow although in Spicemax leg space is good and luggage comes in priority They don t seem to meet the safety standards and are very sensitive to turbulence v borded too in time when doing boarding no announcement to board later seats passenger first since boarding was through aero bridgeit is a window seat and window has a slight curve thus making the seat more tight The seats were too cramped During web check in I wanted 3 seats together since I was flying with my 3 yr old and it was not possible since window and aisle were charged After final booking I got to know that they havenï ½t provide option to select seats whereas other offer to do so we buy extra MAX for more comfort seat could not recline so all timeThe online check in is not very helpful as it generally shows many seats already occupied suggesting in a way to go for preferred seats with more leg room at extra cost So its better to select your seats during normal web checkin where you don t have to spend as much in flight experience was not good because I was made to change my seat against my wish Not adequate seating spaceSeats are uncomfortable I mean I woke up at 7 30am prior a day of light to web checkin the only option for the web check in seats were all middle seats no windows nor aisle seats available most of them were asked to pay 150 or 200 rupees extra or you need to be present at the counter to get your seat We were 4 passengers traveling together despite our best efforts we couldn t get seats together neither through web check in nor through airport check in We booked two aisle seats online but when we boarded the flight our seats were not the ones we had booked The seats are not very comfortable It started with big noise of propeller fans followed by bumpy and turbulent journey Seats are not comfortable I enquired whether this seat reclined to which she nodded in yes No your seats are seperate The seats were so cramped that the four hour flight couldn t end fast enough Travelled from BLR to DEL Seats are very small seat covers are not good Seat was also not comfortable and it does not allow to select seats for free There is no enough leg space for each seat Ride was quite bumpy because of turbulence The flight was good but the seats were not much comfortable but price is less Thirdly when we approached the airport check in counter we were told that only if we pay Rs 1000 extra per person we could have 2 seats together its a budget airline hence not much expectation on luxury the flight is always on time and hospitality is excellent to upgrade to XL seats or Max seatsUnfortunately I was travelling in a bus and then had to borrow a laptop to book the seat We had 4 seats reserved and the luggage area above our seats should be given to usThis time around inspite of charging a premium I was allotted a seat on an aircraft that did not have premium seats availableSince i was with an infant and senior citizen they just didnt budge for my seat preference even when the seats were available Although I have not booked Spice max seats but at least sufficient leg space should be available for all the seats However even after reaching almost 2 5 hours before flight time according to the boarding pass dispatcher only middle seat was available across all the rows Seats are too small and also very congested We had been travelling together as a family and had prebooked prepaid Spicemax seats 3A 3B and immediate seats behind us 5A 5B as seen on the seat map No row 4 on the seat map is there economy in my return journey i had to check for bedbug infestation as the seat had symptoms for it It is indeed a minor inconvenience for me but the concern is ï ½how could they miss this as back rest is important for the passenger comfort and more important from safety perspectiveï ½ o their service though there is no option to do an online booking and reserve 2 seats together without being asked for a fee One more thing spicejet prior to check in tries very hard through e mails to sell its choice seats pre booking of foods etc Thus despite checking in online in advance I and my mother could NOT get seats together above that the plane was so old the seats were so congested and seat cover were not in a good condition One that you can buy an economy ticket and upgrade by paying Rs 1200 to 1500 for a seat in the First row which has good leg space Indigo let me choose the max seats with good leg space while Spice does not Some of the seats were not maintained so well after travelling as the seats did not offer enough legroom weight rates were high food stale and smelly just as the unclean and smelling seats I found reading light and air flow controller above my seat was not functioning Their seats are not clean and good I could buy wifi onboard in advance petty extra charge in view of what we were paying for our seats one would think and then when we got onboard once again I couldn t purchase wifi as my phone wouldn t connect to the internet to pay as I didn t have wifi WTF The seats are TERRIBLE One comment I had was that the seats covers were a bit threadbare in places our 2 girls apparently didnâ t have seats One of the cabin crew members tried to push my seat from the behind slightly only to retort with you need to push you seat from the front or else my back will break Seat pitch on planes is skimpy and seats are crap On Apr 22 I emailed about seat arrangement request as call centre assigned our seats completely different from what we requested and attitude was rude Why Etihad just gives up automatically your seat for someone else just because they are first in the line As a last comment I must say some people are an absolute disgrace with the mess they leave behind them food thrown on the floor and all sorts of rubbish just left on the floor and seats crew come round frequently with a bin to collect rubbishSuch uncomfortable seats and rubbish food We were seated behind the toilets by a side door and could strech outthe legroom for my height is just terrible The staff were very rude to several customers that moved to different seats as the plane wasn t full staff was so rigid and arrogant they refused to change my seat and asked 90 after 1 hour new offer was 60 if i want that seat such a inhuman staff many nearby travelers saw this drama and offered help to me husband didn t say a word because he likes to stay away from arguments while I felt like punching that man in the nose on the flight food quantity was very less food arrived very late FA s were ready to get in an argument with passengers they did not care if people were walking during a turbulence there was a lady who asked for some waterIn the 777 at least the louder engine noise drowned out this annoying sound and I managed a good few hours sleep on the comfortable seats which recline to almost a flat bed but the cost was silly and the seats remained empty both ways which was such a waste I have very bad knees and suffer from claustrophobia the seat was hell for me Flight was only a third full and wanted to move seats to give me more leg room Cabin crew manager was rude and refused to let me me move to exist seat even though none of the exist seats were beingâ Only one positiv was the fact that it was a brandnew plane with a very low noise level in business there are lie flat seats meals toiletry bags the new ones are not as useful where is the lip balm when I insisted and of course was desperate with obvious stress about all these things as they were overbooked and itâ s their policy to give away confirmed seats to who pay extra money Bathroom was not cleaned and also in the plane you see garbage under seats No one bothered to pick up garbage as other airline employee pick garbage if they see like emirates Terrible service terrible food dirty aeroplane and the least legroom of the Middle Eastern airlines Disinterested staff mush food awful seats hopeless website The turbulence was horrible too much of it for far too long The seats were very comfortable sitting up and lying flat As seniors we have flown many times with many airlines even flying Etihad and our experience was good but since they have had cut backs which I will never understand only effects economy passengers who are sixty percent of the paying passengers It as horrible flight The aircraft was an old Airbus A320 dirty plane my seat was broken could not recline the seats are have ugly grey puke yellow cloth covering over the seats and soon as we sat downFood was awful and little choice virtually no leg room particularly when seat in front reclined stop off and transfer in Abu Dhabi is good but REALLY expensive if you do stop over One of the bloggers warned against seat 5 C H which are facing backwards and are the seats which are closest to the toilets saying that the seats we were occupying were paid for they weren t they were empty My neighbor sitting next to me took half of my legroom under the tray table The seat is lie flat and its firmness is adjustableCabin Seat The Studio no 6A 6K were like a small room Plane had rubbish uncomfortable seats and the transfer at Abu Dhabi was a scum But getting terrible seats for two very very long flights is The seats are moderately comfortable to sit in and horrendous to sleep in very disappointed to know when i called and asked the reserve the seats for my parents as they are travelling to US with disability request and no front rows seats can be reserved as its paid service now they wouldnt move us even after many requests and it was the worst flight I ever had big shout out to the girl in the middle seat who really was ok with my boy the whole 15 hour flight We where allocated seats in the middle rows 20 D E they were an aisle middle seat which suited us as we would not interrupt anyone when we needed the toilet or needed to stretch our legs However more and more people I speak to are experiencing the same problems once seated and trying to settle in for the journey we more and more are having the flight ruined by lack of respect from parents My hubby has the problem with his seat and hardly lean back his seat the foods are ok and staffs are quite nice One more bad thing is that you can t choose your seat anymore for free The toilets which were rank ran out of toilet paper and the seat wouldn t stay up during use The noise was deafening which is what u get when u hold humans hostage in a small and uncomfortable tin can with no room to escape The A330 is not a great aircraft for long haul flights Perth Abu Dhabi is 11hours with lower legroom less comfortable seats smaller TV screens and greater engine noise The return flight was better at least I wasn t stuck behind a huge passenger who insisted on reclining their seat Seats were pretty trash on the way home â We must try several times to register the membership number you cannot check in more than 24hours If you do not choose the seat and PAY the seat The plane was half empty with people having 3 and 4 seats to them selves on a night flight seat secondly I placed a bid for the empty neighbouring seat There was no leg room and seats were horrible We upgraded our seats at the airport and they refused to accommodate our meals Entertainment system is limited in quantity and variety the noise cancelation headphones do not cancel noise at all The touch screens on the seats are more like punch screens they barely work No matter what seat I picked even the worst seats I had to pay extra simply for picking a seatWould Etihad ever allocate a exit seat or premium economy seat to me without additional charge even if the seat is vacant So effectively due to an Etihad issue our flight was changed and we got terrible seats and we arrived over 10h later and Etihad is utterly uncontactable regarding this so that we can claim neither from Etihad nor from our separately purchased travel insurance about the flight delay I was sat between 2 people whilst there were empty seats scattered around the plane To start with about 3 hours into the flight you realise how uncomfortable the seats are and how poor the service is We paid a little extra and sat in bulkhead seats by an exit door on the plane which gave us about 10 feet of leg room and also room to stand up during the 13 15 hour flight to and from Chicago There were also many children in business class that crawled all over seats and people adjacentSeating was absolutely horrible the worst seatsI There was a problem with the app and only my seat was upgraded not my husbandIt is bad enough that they charge for seats given that are apparently not a budget airline although you could argue this now but to deceive their paying customers into paying for seats they did not want to pay for and then refusing to refund the payment regardless of who was at fault is disgraceful just had trip with etihad business class on a700 not too bad seats bit hard then on a380 different cattle of fish much better excellent much needed wheel chair service out and return only thing very very disapionted with chouse my seats on line two months before flying didâ I m not tall but nevertheless found it very cramped space between rows is narrow and width of seat is awful but I suppose any seat would after a 12 hour flight only lady hostess there was quite rude with passengers as someone who asked her the seat she just pointed on the seat numbers asking the guest to find it by himself Etihad sometimes gets a bad rap for cramming more seats into the plane I am 6 feet tall and my knees were touching the seat in front Do think Etihad is a good airline offering a high standard of travel but as a lot of airlines allow passengers to recline their seats which I find annoying and shows a lack of respect for fellow passengers the cabin senior and manager were very rude and they displaced a sick vomiting patient from their seat to our next seat The few of us who had been served breakfast were told to just throw the trays under the seats put the tray table up and wait Only bad thing timings were a little delayed and there was simply no legroom Flight was ok seat gave me a sore neck did not have the option to upgrade to business class with miles there was a young man siting in the seat my partner said i think you have the wrong seat this one is mine his mother bent over and said no he has to sit thereHate having to pay out to pick a seat and even within the 24hr check in when itâ s free you can only choose your free seat on the first leg Apart from a full flat bed the seat itself was not much bigger than Economy But some aircrafts are not the newest ones and seats are sometimes a little dirty already We were stuck with uncomfortable seats especially seats behind bulk head The seats were narrow and the leg room was the worst I have had for a long time Even for a seat in the front row or in the exit row with more leg room they now ask extra money My only complaint was the seats 11 days later I got a response that Mr M L is not able to assign the seats asked me to contact service centre I argued that the seats are vacant and unless someone comes they are free to takeAsk for a cup of water the cannot be bother stewardess can walked past my seat thrice and forget about it totally ask for a tooth brush â Sir we donâ t carry onboard â they changed our plane from the fabulous A380 to the very ordinary 777 which we hate wrong seats seating very uncomfortable main course beef very rare could not eat extremely disappointing except there were 5 good uk movies to watch Anyway after a lot of noise from Madrid Etihad refunded the extra cost for those seats This is without a doubt the worst Seat in Business Class on all Etihad Flights maybe even the world Poor food and very uncomfortable seats the airlines do it and if you are traveling alone then u get the worst middle seat my blanket got wet soiled because the customer in the front row pushed his seat and the orange juice kept on the front table was toppled Absolutely disgusted to find on check in that our seats were intentionally separated We were a couple travelling together on one booking In flight I was watching my iPad and suddenly the lady in front pushed her seat backYou have to sit properly upright otherwise our knees would hit the seat in front of you I havenâ t even stepped foot on the airline and couldnâ t be less impressed with what is clearly an intentional policy aimed at duping people into paying for seats to sit next to their partner I was surprised that on the return journey the flight was not full and the front rows were empty some girls decided to move for leg room and were asked to move back to their seats or use other empty sits as the front row is for people who pay extra fare to use it If you have seats near the toilet it will be very noisy let alone how to get it working once my wife told them as i asked several times then to top it off the hostess ran her drinks cart into my knee to avoid those with heads and legs who had 3 and 4 seats to themselves and did not even apologize The seat room is smaller than usual and they seem more packed in Our holiday was tarnished from check in our selection for locking in and paying for seats for our flight declined repeatedly incurring a 97 pending charge on my travel card this happened six times and the funds are still holding on my card There was an obvious difference between the Qantas operated aircraft and Etihad one firstly when it is meal time the Qantas staff insist that all the seats are upright the dreamliner boasts more leg roomLetting their children stand and jump on seats kick and punch the screens in front shouting and screaming tantrums to get their way and playing iPads iPhones on full volume to mention the main topics and they have joined the rip off of charging for seats May The seats in front of me 49 B C D E F G was all empty Flight ey244 lahore to abu dhabi very poor service delayed by 2 hours and no led behind seats We were splitted up and sat on middle seats in the front and in the back of the plane On my leg from Abu Dhabi to JFK New York I was put in a seat with no cabin space above me Form terrible booking and seat allication to horrible rude stuff and no regards to maintain time ours were 1 3 hr late made me miss connection Etihad has to be one of the worst airlines in the world Four go and return flights always on time and without major problems apart from the fact that legroom is always reduced for tall people like me so it is very difficult to find the position to sleep You haven t managed to sell the seats simply because it does get to be very expensive The airline has opted for thin hard foam seats so they can squeeze in more rows and torture even the smallest of travellers Beautiful aircraft high tech but I find the seat is somehow just a bit too high and it tilt so that my feet just touch the floor still she persisted and got me a seat anyhow by bumping a staff member to the next flight More scary was you could clearly see the rivets on the wing and engine were split but crew do not pay attention and the worst of all apart from no oxygen was we were in turbulence for over 180 minutes of the flight and passengers where holding on for dear life The seats seem to be narrower with less leg room The seats closer to the aisle face backwards while the seats closer to the windows face forwards What a suck company when we tried to change the seat it has gone error Hard to get your prefered seat the seats always block by the ground staff the first class lounge at Abu Dhabi is quiet good Padding on seat poor she had to stop and take her seat so that people from seats 24 onwards didnâ t get one 80 when I asked to change the place of the sick patient whose seat was somewhere elsehalf the cost of flying B A more destinations available More legroom than most and you will get less leg room than in a low cost airlines because seats are so packed we went on a package and every turn they are trying to get you to book spare seats or bid for an upgrade and even pay for a standard seat i have a heart condition and sat behind an empty row of leg room seats the flight was half empty and some of the Arab quests were being upgraded because their wife or grandad was in business by themself really I needed to move as I had cramp so moved into the empty row to be told we sell these seats you can sit in any other seat butI explained that I did not want to pay twice for the same seat as I don t have a lot of money anyway The seats are crammed into a hole next to a big box I realized that there is a bad odor on the seat itself or the seat next to meThen at the airport found that half the plane was empty so seats were allocated to balance weight etc in terms of seating the top rows with extra legroom need to be paid for and even if they are empty you wont be allowed to move into them So I essentially had wasted my money on a seat I could have been allocated anyway Till then they do block the seats and so we decided to let the airline allocate our seats and were in all cases non window seats and the food was poor so I had to call for assistance each time and surprisingly the staff would immediately pinpoint the issue and move my seat The Etihad Dreamliner offers long range Busines class comfort with lots of room and lie flat seats also on the 3 hour flight from Amman to Abu Dhabi I m only 6ft 5inches and my knees hit the seat in front Seats are normal Business Class standard with lie flat option Hence I selected seat 6A from AD to Seoul and 6K from Seoul to AD for a 9 hours flight The operating noise of the plane was almost unbearable luckily we both had noise cancelling headphones I realise when I was out of the airport in Heathrow I did call Etihad lost and found and told em about exact seat no where was placed in the corner of theâ On the second leg I had a seat with blocked window the leg room and width of seats is poor for long haul I m 5ft 10 and 13 stone I sat next to an elderly couple and the seats in front of us were extra leg room however the young man in front insisted on putting his chair back fully and it was clear the old man was squashed in and terribly uncomfortable Having to pay for seats in economy that are uncomfortable to say the least the revolting slop they serve as a meal was totally inedible and not sufficient for a long haul flight obviously this is because they are now trying to get you to buy food from their new overpriced onboard menu wellWhen flights where not full we was allowed to lay across seats to get some good sleep given extra blankets if needed On boarding the plane which was late we realised that the plane had been changed and we were given two seats on a row of three definitely not what i paid for Poor seating comfort on a 14 hour flight We flew both ways from and to Sydney in June from Abu Dhabi on both legs we Paid for extra leg room to be in exit row was cold from doors so needed 3 blankets seats narrow so hard to get comfortable as no room to turn side wards or pull arm rest up between my husband and I improvement needed as food quality overall poor and insufficient for 13 hours consisted of 1 meal of noodles AVOID THIS AIRLINE if you can not much legroom sound system not working as headsets are faulty dirty toilets no hand lotion and cologne in lavatories food is awful the list is endless I had a bad experience before the flights when buying extra legroom seats both the ways the staff is so dumb that they couldn t give the seats in sequence to families Seats are quite old and tired lookingMOST uncomfortable seat I have ever sat in I mean why should we pay to choose our seats Even my poc that my wife took to the rear of the plane that was falling apartWe checked in 9 hours early and were given the worst seats in economy for our trip from Abu Dhabi to edinburgh I requested the flight steward if I can move into any one of the seats because I was feeling quite sick Crappy seats Extremely cheap shot by charging to reserve seats Its business class we paid alot to get the seats and the service was very bad The clerk took more than 1 hour delaying my check in needed to make multiple calls to correct his first mistake after I pointed this out to him and his supervisor failed to re seat me next to my family during the name change exercise promised there would be no problem when returning from NYC could not check in on line in NYC preassigned seat was again lost customer services responses were of no use they had no way to assist Then another passenger came along and sat next to my partner and myself and this mother leaned over and asked her if she would sit in the seat her son had been given and her son could have her seat she was quite taken aback and non committal Flight from London Heathrow to Abi Dhabi best flight ever been on shocked plane was more less empty so was aloud to have three seats to myselfThe seat cushions in Business Class were so broken and uncomfortableHowever the cabin air noise 787 9 prevented me from getting any sleep Service quality online check in seating with my family were disappointing We ended up with seats apart from each other as the system seems to fill in empty seats from the front for example allocation one window seat to us on the right of the plane and the next seat the left window seat on the next row but unfortunately we get disappointed again since the interior was below the expectation and the seat were congested unlike their rival Emirates Seats are hard and not suitable for more than 2 hours This continued for quite a few minutes when I realised they were escorting another gentleman into my seat The staff member tried to charge for the child seat for my son when in fact the Etihad website specifies that we must bring this seat if we wish for him to sit in his own seat But the shock came that by just visiting the seat selection page removed the already selected seats andIn a couple of instances the seats were so close that you felt like in prison The seats were crazy hard but leg room was good We queried the seating selection and Etihad cabin crew were rude in manner telling us â Etihad have honoured the booking by seating us together â Its headphones can cut out most of the noise around and its comfortable to use for long hours Though I was at the back of the plane the seats were very uncomfortable and had very little leg roomBuisness class was worse than any economy class I have ever used apart from comfortable seat inflight tv system not working lunch menu offered from 8am lights turned out as if night time flight from around 2 pm irish time Our 14 hour flight was on a small plane with the most uncomfortable seats ever small hard with no knee space at all I felt that was because they made actual seat shorter giving feeling of more leg room She looked at the seats and told me to sit on what I think was 49k as she said it was empty My seat was broken for the Brisbane Abu Dhabi leg it wouldn t recline In general planes need a revamp old seats entertainment half the time hand controls are slow or unresponsive seats flat and hard Drinks all the way nice meals the only thing I never understand is I forgot my Burberry cashmere scarf on my seatflight attendant was very rood and impolite with here response and said exactly that she has nothing to do with the cockroaches or the money I paid for my seat pls set down military orders Nasty junk food Broken seats Malfunction of entertainment Back seat storage pockets dirty Non sense air conditioningFrom Abu Dhabi to Tokyo the plane was smaller and our friends did not get the extra leg room seats they had paid for Was woken up onlyduring light turbulences and suddenly the 7 hourflight was over Because of the very uncomfortable seats and lack of any leg room I would think twice about flying with the airline Worst of all when the crew were instructed to take their seats the male crew member opposite us starting reciting the Koran With Etihad airlines u cannot change your seat unless you pay a lot for it i received an email that my bid for neigbouring seats got accepted now the don t want to refund my money for the extra leg room seat Seats are hard despite adjustable Watch with paying extra for neighbour seats or extra legroom Etihad will steal your money Initially it seemed like any other long haul international economy flight however the seats were generally uncomfortable and had less leg room than other similar ranked airlines my friend and I are of average height and weight and our knees were uncomfortably pushed up against the seat in front of us Being 6 4 the seats when laid flat were not quite longâ when we landed in Abu Dhabi rather that being able to rest before the long flight we spent 5 hours in cues arguing haggling fighting for the seats we had already paid for After choosing Etiad airways for our trip to Scotland we were extremely disappointed at the leg room and seat width Somone later said these are paid seats which is fine albeit the seat remained empty for the whole flight The seats are built in a way that makes you sit face to face with someone so one needs to be careful while seat selection The only that hasn t changed is the legroom Guess were they put us in the least desirable seats in the plane I can tolerate the poor food uncomfortable seats and poor inflight entertainment system Of course at the airport the flight was full and we ended up seated far away from each other I put a bid in for the Melbourne to Abu Dhabi leg on the way over and payed for extra leg room seats on the shorter leg to Rome The first leg my wife and I were allocated spacious seats 4 rows apart and had to drop to standard to get seats next to each other then couldn t move back to spacious without charge I sit in the extra room seats as I prefer the extra legroom for the 14 hour flight On boarding i noticed there were 5x empty â premiumâ seats 3 rows in front of me The result was a sore behind and the need to constantly shift in my small uncomfortable seat to relieve the soreness so I could get out of the middle seat and go to the bathroom We always pay to choose our seats as my husband is a very nervous flyer unfortunately we were quoted Â 240 to do this way too much in our opinion My bad experience with Etihad started before even reach my seat Staff were dismissive both ways and very uncomfortable seats quite cramped for a 14 hour flight Seat pitch was I d guess 31 staff appeared disinterested and certainly couldn t be bothered to check the state of the toilets which were pretty grim by the time we reached Amsterdam Seats old not enough space reclined little more than economy Seats On the return flight hubby had the bad seat experience touch screen not working properly seat didn t massage or recline fully etc and we both struggled moving the seats back and forth They sold my seat to someone else once i arrived in Abu Dhabi they failed to check me in Woke up early to do so and there were many seats available shortly before the 24 hour mark which magically disappeared as 24 hours hit to the minute Seats seem strangely distant from the wall of the plane but that allows somewhere to stash your bag My request to move my seat as the one I had for a 14 hour flight was broken was met with a sigh and eye rolling The seats are a little hard but have lumbar support which is a rarity Furious after being lied to I go up to ask for one but am forced to sit back down due to turbulence Now they have squeezed so many seats into buiness class you wonder if you are flying economy plus with silverware andâ Stranded at Turkey airport with no one to communicate with it took us 6 hours to find out that our leg home from Abu Dhabi to LA was cancelled and the seats were gone Lastly was the cabin crew service while serving they were talking rather loudly among themselves disturbing quite a few sleeping passengers To add to this the seat pitch is minimal and no bigger than a Ryan Air although they do highlight as to having more of an incline which is great if you are not sat behind the person who has their seat fully inclined in which case you can t see your in flight entertainment screen and the fold out tray is virtually pressed against you The error was that the seats were not available anymore this happened 5 times The seats are very narrow with little leg room and once the person in front puts their seat back for a sleep you might as well follow as the screen is less 30cm from your face Lots of passengers had been split from their families so weâ re moving around causing delays in getting everyone seated The lady on the platinum service booked me on a seat with with extra leg room 4 hours before my flight and that was not enough to lose our seats for an illogical reason In 24 hours before the flight it was shown that there were only 6 seats free to chose from all in the middle Anyway those seats remain vacant throughout the flight as expected Even when we had to change seats due to an injured groupmember they stored it overhead the seat did not recline and the media player did not work i wear a body medical cam that takes my bp oxygen levels heart rate and films the surroundings i am in Etihad took 3 weeks to cover up there big mistakes of not giving me oxygen and lied about it to cover themselves up however the ATSB has seen the vision of there unprofessional staff also the crew and pilots in Athens turned up 40 minutes lateSeats in economy are so narrow that a slightly overweight person wouldn t fit in them The seats were a little harder than I imagined but stretching out was a luxury I have been flying regularly for 8 years with Etihad and couldn t believe it when i was told I couldn t move to an empty bulkhead seat with no reason Very little legroom and impossible to stretch out oneâ s legs under the seat without getting your feet tangled in the personâ s in front One seat was stuck at recline position couldn t move and I while Etihad get to resell my economy seats I requested them if the flight is full if not then kindly add the remark to the seats that we are a couple with an infant so kindly leave the neighbor seat as empty IF and ONLY IF the flight is not full but the contact center agent Anida she had 0 idea of what I was talking aboutWe flew economy class and seats in both flights were a little cramped And our economy seats were roomy for a 14 hour flight The power supply was badly positioned as the cable of any thing you would plug in would obstruct your exit from the seat I fly frequently on this route with the same airways but it s services are not the same every time very less leg space if the neighboring seat is emptyFood was terrible seats are smaller and harder than other airlines Singapore Emirates if you want to risk flying ETIHAD camel airways then go for it cause 1 of there staff told me that even there dream liner is not a dream liner as seats all squished in they paint there old KLM aircraft up and refurb them to make then look like dream liner far from it Having to pay to pick seats isnâ t typical of a flag carrier itâ s a trait of a struggling airline or budget airline Then when we got to the immigration officer he told us we had to take a seat and wait for a secondary screening For a few terse seconds I thought I was going to get bumped to another seat However 8 hours in any economy seat is long but the OK food and good entertainment made it bearable I actually thought there might be a seat cushion missing The plane we were on had no toilets in the middle of the cabin meaning if the carts were out you were blocked into your seat andThe seats where small by business class standards and the tv was in the arm rest and awkward to use The plane was dated uncomfortable the seats felt hardThe woman then accosted a hostess and said she wanted her son to sit there the hostess explained that it was not his alloated seat and she could not just let him sit there The seat function was poor as I couldnâ t move my seat back My seat recline wasn t working either We decided to wait until 24 hours before travelling as we were led to believe we could then pick a seat free of charge but in fact on logging in we found they had allocated seats to us and every other seat on the plan was blocked off so no choice at all in the matter She said cannot give more than 3 seats together But seats in economy are little congestedWhilst I seem to have enough leg room the seats themselves were uncomfortable and I ended up with severe back ache during the flight I m asking our self are the stuff s representative understand the language english or not We don t ask for a favor only to be seated at the empty alley The seats were so hard that we had to get up many many times Second In the Airbus A332 the seats are hard and short Seat didn t work properly either but better than the attendants So I bid on the seats and the day before my flight I get another email to say that your bid has been accepted and I also get a notification from my bank app that my credit card has been charged reclining her seat leaving very little room and making it impossible to watch the little tv screen as it was about 6 inches from my face Another thing was i had been allocated two seats free of cost before i decided to upgrade them so if they could not give me the seats i paid extra for why did they not put us back in the initial seats and refund the money as the service which was paid for could not be provided Entertainment in seat didn t work because short flight Not as much seat room as expected not these really nice customer service that is and I am an airways member and then they charged me for a neighbour seat on the way back because i would not pay for reserved seats things to work on some of the stewards were as miserable as sin and need to learn to smile Coming back the plane appeared old and the seats were very uncomfortable Boeing 777The plane was old the seats were so uncomfortable the inflight entertainment was old difficult to use and of poor quality the services were unacceptable no menus on any of the flights on one flight we were passed a scrap of paper with the food choices written on it to pass on to the seat behind us the food was terrible the food choice we wanted was only available on two out of four of our flights small portions just a meal and a dry bread roll one drinks service no orange juice water services However I must have missed an announcement not to leave my seat and made my way to get some water when I noticed all the crew sitting at back of plane who upon seeing me had most of the female crew telling me quite rudely to take my seat without letting me speak and we were seated near all of the crying babies At checkin inform the PAX that the flight is busy and issue a middle seat b The seats on the flights were not very comfortable especially with the actual seat i felt that the seat is hard a little bit This was a late night flight and plenty of turbulence was encountered The seats are hard unconformable and leg room is poor for an airline vaunted as having a great service 3 of us are all seating alone so it wasn t their seat to sell The seats in economy were also more cramped than usual I ve just tried to book in online only to discover these people charge you Â 30 PER FLIGHT to choose your seat that s an extraWhen they give you a seat at the exit row randomly they pull you out at the check in desk and tell you that you can t have the seat The head rest on the seat had a permanent side fixture that was uncomfortable to sleep against making for a longer flight We requested them to change our seats and they spoke to us very rudely and refused The App stalled attempted again on one seat stalled again All seats are baby seat barely any leg space I feels seat little congested but no complaint from family We had less legroom than my usual Swiss air flight to Zurich the plane seats wereâ I bid on neighbouring seats for a flight the day before my flightand I faced so many problems with Etihad starting from changing the seat I paid for to cancelling the flightAfter invoking the services of the maintenance men who grumpily ripped the seat apart and played with the motors and cushioning staff advised that nothing could be done Such as still game facilities not working on the seat back TV Could you at least hand in a printed paper or instruct your check in crew to verbally inform customers that only paying the fee doesn t solve the issue and that you might lose your reserved seats incase of name change so that at least i can connect to the wifi at the business lounge and RE reserve my seats for the flight back home if your staff are NOT ALLOWED TO DOSeat was tiny and hardIf we want to sit together we have to pay 30 euros to change the seat for four trips When it came to disembarking at JFK I forgot a personal item in one of the overhead cabins Now the last time i checked two seats side by side is not the same as three in a row Seats were fairly comfortable and they took pains to accommodate families with children around us It was forced to pay for the seat that too around 100 CHF extra for the seat in Zurich Abudhabi flight In Economy you get very uncomfortable seats Business class seats now starting to show its age not as comfortable on long haul as say a qantas seat even though it looks more flashy and I have been told not asked to move when I spend time in making sure I get the seat I need medically and find this totally inappropriate I have asked after the take off if I could move to different seats they refused in a harsh way Â 120 we paid up front 10 months before flying to secure two seats I really dont have to be I saved along time for this privilege and researched the seats I have contacted Etihad several times only to be told they will do nothing as they dont have to do anythingAlso the actual seats were rather hard There was very less passengers in the flightIn the airplane we were seated on the last row and we didn t get good rest because of the loud flushing sound coming from the toilet intermittently and that the crew hung around at the back and chatted loudly among themselves during most of the journey There is no option to choose seats unless its paid everything is already sorted by the time you are your seat seats were crampped staff were surly and had to be encouraged to privide drinks half the plane was partitioned off with no access we are small but the fellow next to us was about average sizeThis time it was either we have to pay for the seats or wait till the last moment At 24hrs a seat seems to be allocated and can t be changed Little bumpy flight due to turbulence but a couple of Mclaren Vale Shiraz helped toâ no help was given and an unnecessary argument happened even through there were 4 spare seats in front Etihad of old would have resolved this issue Now charge extra for eg bulkhead economy seats We arrived to check in at the airport 5 hours before the flight having tried unsuccessfully online 24 hours earlier and were told that there were no seats available Guess what they put us at the window and the meadly seats with another passenger at the alley The seats if anyone wants to check are not even Extra Leg room seats The seat was as hard as a board and the pod was cramped Bid on the extra seat for a very low price turned out that aircraft full both waysseats were the usual economy class I would expect more from Etihad for a 3500 USD ticket the seats of the plane are from the 90â s not to mention how uncomfortable they are The in flight entertainment was really good the seats quite uncomfortable with very little room compared to BA 380 There was a fair bit of turbulence on the flight over the AtlanticWe paid for extra leg room seats for a night flight and were next to the galley In addition given the crammed condition of the economy class I requested assistance from the crew to recline my seat as several trials for the same failed and we were group of 4 friends and at the time of check in all were given different seats as did a mistake of coming to the airport for a late checkin She pointed out that I must have my legs below the front seat on the floor I asked at Manchester for seats together and was told I would have to go to customer services in Abu Dhabi and ask there Economy class seat distance were too short not enough room to move even though I was an average size Only after finishing the booking I realized I was charged 30 for one seat and 10 for the other Great help and service on the flight out of Singapore but as a gold card member I asked on the flight Abu Dhabi Brussels to inform me if I could change the seat because flight was not overbooked even 72 empty places after boarding completed the flight intendent went to severalâ Seats were a little uncomfortable in economy If going long haul I would recommend paying the little bit extra for the extra leg room seats and I found that all seats even the economy class seats in the back are not free to change when I select the same seats again it asks for money again I have a relative who also fell for this deceptive seat selection process and also paid for seats without realizing And this just because the sell more tickets than seats in the plane so when you arrive to the airport and she was very short and sharp and said pay for the seatThe plane seemed much older which was evident by the in flight entertainment system same movies and tv shows but the screen was not as bright and was less responsive to touch and the seats which were much less comfortable and were extremely cramped Didn t like the idea of having to pay for your seat thought that was for cheap airlinesI had a row of 4 seats to myself andAs the seats were selling out fast I didn t want to risk being separated from my partner for the whole tripThese were regular economy seats and we were charged unnecessarily During the whole flight the In flight entertainment WiFi TV movies assigned to my seat Did Not work Only issue was not being able to choose seat until 24hrs before flight time the service was hopeless and the seats were very clustered Ended up in a emergency row so had lots of legroom but the tray table was terribly designedNow when I eventually boarded the flight Gate check in staff moved my seat to an area without extra leg room If you are seating in the economy class Several seats around us on all sectors were broken headphones didn t workThe airplanes MUST be changed to those destinations at least changing the seats The seats and remote controls also show lots of wear and tear Passengers are standing for more than 30 minutes not enough seats in waiting area We booked two tickets husband and wife they allocated seat at two different row which is ridiculous if they want to sell eat selection they should at least keep the seats together in the same itineraryFor economy class you get to select the seat 48 hours before the flight during checkin Watch out for your things falling under the seat it is impossible to retrieve them They claim it was clear on the site that these seats were chargeable Poor seating charge extra for seats together and overall nothing like the experience of Emirates We also have been given the seats with extra leg room next to the exit escape doors with no additional cost or issue Not impressed that you have to pay for a seat if you want to choose where you want to sit very budget airline like The seats space around them were tiny pity the slightly bigger person who would feel great discomfort Why oh why did we pay this money for nothing we wish we had not booked the seats and just turned up on the day We were unable to select seats or change any details on line With so much noise from so many passengers in the lounge how could they expect one to hear it they have the best inboard services my son was happy especially from their TV programs food fantastic but our flight to Mombasa we had to fight to get seats next to each other cos they hadnâ t located us together after talking to others paxBut this time the seat was so uncomfortable I had to take painkillers to get me through the flight Flew economy in as I couldnâ t get a business upgrade the bids on the seats were ridiculously high would have been cheaper to buy a seat outright I settled into my seat and waited for the other passengers to board We chose business class because baby was supposed to get real baby sleeping bed and not sleep on the seat with us 12 1 2 6 1 2 hours cramped into one of their seats on these long haul flights was a killer Added to this is the configuration of the A380 whereby every alternate row is facing the rear of the plane I was repeatedly told itâ s airline policy to overbook and if I donâ t buy the seats in advance I thought Online check in is only optional but itâ s a ruse to get more money a cheap way by airlines like Etihad the seats will be sold to who checks online and buy another staff told its first come first serve What about a confirmed ticket then who will honor that Seats changed after we paid for preferred no explanation we were then split up across the aircraft my wife was pestered by a drunken passenger which I had to deal with three times and cabin crew kept supplying this customer with alcohol even though they knew he was drunk 21 hours in a seat that makes you lower back ache is a long trip Paid for the seats 4 times and never sat there Etihad explained that it â canAnother irritation is the exorbitant amount they charge for either a free seat next to you or for extra legroom massively more than any other airlineCan only guarantee that our 6 year old will be sat with us if we pay an additional Â 1000 to reserve seats now The company has left several rows empty between the business and economic class so I ve asked the stewards to move a head instead of sitting together with two more people A320 had 3 3 seats in economy and they didn t mind We purchased extra leg room seats on one leg that did not even exist on the flight Only downside is this airline charges for each seat selection which is a bit sad as for normal economy seats there is no need do it but again it s their way of getting some extra revenue An air steward requested to charge his mobile phone using the USB in front of my son s seat even though there were many empty seats around probably so that he could keep an eye on his precious phone while flirting with the stewardesses at the back Now they charge you for preassigned seat for any checked in luggage and their inflight service is extremely poor Realizing I paid for seats that I did not want to pay for I contacted Etihad by email asking for a refund of the seat payments We paid Â 100 each for extra legroom seat 40 41 when I boarded to planeWe found the seats on the newer A380 and Dreamliner are hard and at the end of the 14 hr leg uncomfortable I had 3 young children sat in the seats in front of me one of whom screamed for at least an hour of the flight Planes are getting old Food options are getting smaller seat leg room is small Passenger asked to move seats so staff could use seats to sleep in Economy seats were very narrow and not able to lean back much they have no premium economy seats and business class is very pricey for those not on an expense account The plane boarded in time everyone went into it and was waiting on their seats But the main disappointments were that the recline function on my seat was broken which on a daytime flight wouldnâ t have bothered me as much but on an overnight flight is something I would guess most people would want to make use of and the seat back entertainment screens in my row and others intermittently throughout the plane Difficult to manage with tray down and seat in front reclined If a passenger has purchased a seat that needs to be locked the seats were uncomfortable for such a long journey and it felt like I was sitting on a foam covered board despite the firm to soft control Being afraid that the remaining seats might be gone soon andThey really can t automatically allocate seats next to each other The onward flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi Cochin was in an Airbus 320 100 whose seats are definitely less comfortable than wide bodied aircraft I also overheard a number of people at Tullamarine complaining about this and other check in seat allocation problems The legroom was fine but the seats are like deckchairs with hard dividers arm rests and hard unyielding seat cushions Legroom in Economy is not too bad but the seats are a bit narrow This was the worst treat I ever had they were so overwhelmed because the company sold more seats than what they should Only slight issue was selecting my seat at check in If I had to complain about anything it is the comfort of the seating but all aircraft of this kind are the same in economy classMy main complaint concerns the seats and seating Seats in Economy were very narrow making it very cramped on such a long flight the food was awful and the air conditioning was so cold everyone was putting on parkas and beanies if they had them The Business Class lounge was so full it was hard to find a seat but that was the least problem Probably the worst long haul flight l have ever been on the seats were cramped and the service in economy sadly lacking This kind of pricing strategy and booking process on the official Etihad website in which you are obliged to pick seats otherwise you can not complete the booking and are charged extra no matter what seats you pick is utterly annoying and deceptive because it can easily add 10 to 15 to the tickets The seats and space on 13 hour long haul flight were smaller and tighter than the 6 hours flights which doesnt make sense why make the space smaller for longer flights but I was told the system is not allowing to select seat and it will need to be done at the airport Disgraceful service from Etihad the staff were rude and obnoxious failed to give me the correct allocated seat that I requested through the app when checking in and a complete lack of safety when the plane landed in Abu Dhabi for the layover a box from the galleyâ I flew Etihad twice now and on both occasions they never provide seats next to each other as a family of 3 Second leg flight full and an uncomfortable seat The seats were old school you couldnt lie down Seats are small and too tight between passengers for a 13 hr flight I was told something like the server is down and he couldnâ t allocate seats for me There does not appear to be as much room between each seat as other airlines This platinum card enables me to have extra leg room seat and two pieces of luggage When we tried to reserve and book our seats online there were issues with the payment side which left us unsure if the seats were reserved they could ve used an extra attended or 3 as it appeared they were understaffed and had a hard time keeping passengers in their seat after announcements to stay seated Only middle seats didn t incurr the additional fee â But we saw that our seats were not together and asked to change it while registering in the airport Both outward leg and return from Abu Dhabi to Perth seats in economy very very uncomfortable good very average staff ok leg room average better than budget airlines but only justI had high expectations unfortunately the seats were cramped food wasn t exciting We had exit row seating and on the Dreamliner the seats were not very comfortable and very narrow While Emirates let you select a seat except lowest booking class and as a silver member complimentary Etihad charges for any seat you may want to select Etihad recently changed there booking terms and you now have to pay for a chosen seat or you can be allocated seats for free with a WARNING there may be a chance of separate seats Once on board the plane I proceeded to the seat she told me and sat down ready for take off I was rudely awakened by staff advising that the ECONOMY seat i had taken needed to be paid for REALLY They forgot to put out the head phones the phone charger didn t work on my seat or the other 2 seats they forgot my snack even though I re ordered it we changed seats twice only to find that almost every available seat in business class was had uncomfortable seat cushions but you did not reserve a paid for seat flying again soon but not with Etihadwhy donâ t you mention that the seats are not guaranteed unless we pay extra Torn seats which have to be paid when one wants to delect seats and I can upgrade any one or all of the sectors for class seat with extra leg room or seat with no oneThe strange thing I found was my seat was facing one way my husbands seat was facing me which wasâ 2 I was an extra leg room seat and I was given a seat with someone else s bassinet in front of me with a screaming drooling puking child for my 15 hour portion of my trip but when we checked in leaving the Seychelles for the Abu Dhabi to London sector we were split up into 52J and 70B both middle seats and no one would do anything aboutâ No leg room and impossible to eat when the seat in front is reclined which was most of the time due to the length of journey I am not a snob but just thought this was an open to all lounge and had to wait to get a seat as it was so busy Also there was almost no one sitting in the extra leg room seats near the bulkhead Eventually we were told we had to pick a seat and ended up sitting on uncomfortable metal boxes for 14 hours And seats in economy class were very tight and uncomfortable more so than before This is the third time that I have flown with Etihad Airways I did take advantage of the free seat booking 24 hours prior to flying as this flight was aboard a 777 well known to be well cramped in economy why the seats have to be so close togetherHad to pay extra for seats together as we were spread all over the plane The seats in economy are not that soft or spacious when you are in it for that long The seats are so narrow that you can t help but rub shoulders with the person next to you so you have to sit with your hands between your legs for 13 hours had to hold it up while trying to eat 2 out of the 4 seats where like that as well as the tvThe overall experience with in flight was average The seats in economy were very uncomfortable and Not enough legroomWhen I arrived on the flight I find out that I have a middle seat thatâ s not an exit seat This time the seats were very uncomfortable for such a long flight the food was a disaster I find the seats are cramped and inflight entertainment not to my expectation The entertainment system was not working on most seats I noticed this time i could not check in without paying for a seat The only way that generally an airline is judged by most people is seat comfort and food hours into the flight a hostess reprogrammed the seat bed a little late as we landed 30 minutes later We tried requesting if we could be sat together but we were told the seats were already allocated so it was not possible The Airbus 320 was old and tatty the seats were narrow and not that comfortsble and didnt recline all the way Lack of legroom and hardness of seat cushion was unbearable for 8 hours we touching the seat in front and found it very uncomfortable If there was no seat in the next flight they should have let me stayed in IslamabadThis was not my decision to get a less desirable seat Etihad does promote itself as a one of the world s premium airlines and this may well be true for it s First Class and Business Class passengers although passing through Business to get to our Economy seats it didn t appear to compare to Emirates in terms of layout andâ Not enough legroom either so I requested staff to change my seat so that i will be close to my family butOne of our seats did not recline Disappointment started when I went to choose my seat Narrow seats made into a bed overnight were rock hard So i paid for 3 neighboring seats that i used in the flight and i paid for an extra legroom seat that i didnt use Even Gold and Platinum status holders cannot select a seat for free before 24 hours After paying Â 4000 for our Business class seats I had a seat which was fabric on bare metal when I asked for help I was told I could adjust the seat firmness myself My main issue with Etihad for this flight were the seats I usually book at the rear of economy because in a less than full aircraft there is less passangers If you are flying solo then choose a seat closer to the window the side seats are staggered so one is closer to the windowI purchased one of the seats highlighted in the picture on an Etihad flight however only to be informed by a friend that there is actually no gap between these seats that the are in fact side by side this was what seemed a rather old dated small plane and was the only underwhelming part of the whole experience no storage at seat area which was a pain as on a 7hr 40min journey I would have really liked to have as much of my belongings near and easy to get too easy seat did lay flat but was very narrow and to be honest a slight cramped feelingand I guess the seat padding and leg room aren t what I remember them to be but a numb bum before take off and a few noisy todlersThe airline over booked and despite online check in I was not given the seat on my flight Had a long trip from Australia to Europe and wasn t looking forward to being seating in a squashed plane with lots of people but it turned out that I had plenty of leg space the seat was more than adequate to take my large frame Charges to pick a seat after online check in opens Poor leg room and they have no availability as of now I have to wait till the last 15 minute to boarding before they can see whether they have any seat Arriving at Dublin Terminal 1 NOTE the check in clerk gave us two seats in a row of three next to a window explaining the flight was not very full I could have seated myself next to my wife at a cost of circa Â 100 There must have been a vacant seat on the next day s flight for them to give me a seatThe Business configuration gives a seat configuration that gives you a genuine lie flat bed when fullyâ the seats are not so comfortable for long flight and appears to be congested but the fair is usually affordable Flight from Abu Dubai to Sydney A380 seats are just a bit longer it feels If you do check in 24 hours before you can select your seat but as the Etihad booking system automatically allocates all seat exactly 24 hrs before the flight you effectively have to take the seat they have allocated you as very few empty seats available to choose from when I asked if I could use one I didn t mind paying a minimum charge the senior cabin staff instructed that we could take the seat at USD 90 apparently they charge more on board A very confusing interface of lights TV and seat adjustment with almost no instruction However the seats with extra leg room were chargeable even when you are onboard Being economy class the seat just got uncomfortable on the long flights Secondly I had booked tickets 2 months in advance and I was trying to get my seat assigned 24 hours before the departure but couldn t how did they single me out or chose me for seat cancellation The seats were cramped There was a wakeful and very noisy baby in the seat in front on the first leg I paid for my ticket 3 months in advance and selected my seats online upon arrival at the check in at Manchester Airport I was informed along with 2 other customers that our flight was overbooked and there were no seats left I was informed that all airlines overbook flights to cover the â no show factorâ well I m a frequent flyer to South East AsiaWeâ re hoping for the flights home we are â allocatedâ seats togetherHuge tv and seat and even a bed to sleep Not because of seat but rather passengers sleeping with legs out in the aisle seats tilted back so far theyâ Comfortable economy seat for not so long legged ð These are the most uncomfortable seats ever And the Dreamliner for the long haul flights only three seats across all sections I got out of my seat and went to the crew area and asked for one more drink if that s possible because your co worker said we re not serving right nowSeats in AUH to CCU and CCU AUH were not good â The seats on the older Boeing 777 300 are very hard and there was no offer of any type of mattress that I ve heard are offered by other airlines Some of the passengers could not even find a seat We had to call and pay an extra Â 200 to select seats together the TV screen was the seats were cramped for business class considering I paid Â 2350 for the ticketIf you want to watch movies and the like from the moment you sit in your seat take another airline who are more customer focused I find it hard to understand if you have seats available andIt was a full flight and no spare seats however despite that the seat comfort and space is ok for this long haul flight The seats are no wider than a premium economy seat but provide more than sufficient leg room Etihad seat room space was just so uncomfortableVery tight seat After waiting for 8 hours we managed to get three seats and arrived Montreal I was rather shocked that my seat mate was a VERY large man who needed two seats Our flight from Abu Dhabi was particularly uncomfortable as the seats were TINY At check in I learned that the travel agent had made an error with our seats on the return flights meaning that we would be refused travel on the way home On the over night flight this was particularly uncomfortable when those seated in front of us did recline their seats At first I thought this was probably because it seemed like a mid size plane to me but the seat and legroom conditions did not improve in the seemingly bigger return flight either Now I am told that there is no seat reservation and I have to pay extra to reserve seats for my family Etihad service is fairly standard for the better airlines Seats are maybe a bit thinner than some though legroom was ok in economy My wife and I booked 2 seats in second last row of a 777 as the aisle was wider not constantly bumped by crew and passengers moving about and only 2 seats on the sides rather than the usual 3 The most uncomfortable seats ever Online check in opens 48 hrs but seats only free 24hrs before Travelling economy doesn t give you much room to move so if you need to stretch your legs you better ask for a seat along the isle and not in the middle or near the window I chose and paid for my seats via their online website and paid an extra 220 odd to choose my seats Very uncomfortable seats and so I basically paid for a seat I did not use plus an additional 598 for an already vacant seat along with the other fees Economy seat space was too crunched The seats were really uncomfortable not providing much cushion for the bottom area It was then a crazy mad rush everyone ran to the other gate to try secure a seat I enquired about getting a seat with more leg room or an upgrade happy to pay to be told i should have notified them of my injury when booking the flights and I felt very restricted in my seat Returning my bottom went to sleep seats uncomfortable food still awfull a wrap that i am sure was made out of carboard or something similar The only thing this year When we got to our seats the onlyâ Air Bus 380 on the first leg which has a little more seat space than other planes the seat was changed at the last moment without any reason Baggageâ Sitting in your seat for well over an hour without leaving the groundâ Since I was traveling with my daughter we would have preferred to sit next to each other but since they recently started to charge for pre selected seats and the system wasn t ready for that we couldn t even select any seats to pay for Compared to Cathy the seats were uncomfortable outdated and unimpressive The seats were not much comfortable We had purchased all our seats however were not given the seats we had chosen after paying in full on booking the package in order to do so so practically all passengers could have two or in our case three seats Seats were very uncomfortable but the seat was the most uncomfortable i ve had The seats on this flight are amazingly uncomfortibly hard becoming a problem on the way We prebooked seats on all the 4 flights we used and it was a waste of money on one leg of the journey i am unsure whether the plane wasnt a differnt configuation but seat 22a was one window which was to the rear and a bulk plane base that took up half my seat pitch the seat pitch is one of the worseMy brand new iPhone X was never found after falling under my seat on that flight this was a heartbreaking incident and Ethihad did nothing to compensate the pain I paid extra for more space which gives you more legroom but no difference in seat food etc I have never in all my travels ever paid for selecting a seat and these seats would have been free at check in Cabin temperature ran from slightly warm to almost uncomfortable why airline cabins are so warm when passengers are given blankets is beyond me My seat did not go back wards hence I spent 13 hrs sitting up straight going there Negatives Food quality quantity Attitude service of cabin crews Online check in option is complicated Between 24 48 hours prior to departure paid seats need to be booked â I choose to fly Etihad every time I fly to Australia because the seats recline well sliding forward so that the seat in front is not in your face If there is one criticism it is that for people like me who are over the BMI recommended weight allowance the seats are not exactly big it wasn t the fact that we didn t get the spare the seat it was the way it was handled by the staff and subsequently as well as charging us for it When we were finally boarded onto the plane we took our seats only to be informed that we couldn t leave for another hour due to traffic my seat couldnt be moved at all the food is When you step on the plane you are taken to your seat as opposed to being directed to an aisle Our visas came in and they said nothing to us at the time and the second group went in and any spare seats were allocated elsewhere First off the seats were really uncomfortable The Cabin crew Female serving our seats who is very rude no smiling face Their customer service agent are only their to occupy seatsThis airline does not allow you to use online check in change your seats or change your meals if you do not book directly with them they be have low cost for a high privÃ no choicee of seats no choice of meal seat distance in 777 too small no european rights of passengersThe system was not allowing us to change the seat and the ground service at the Abu Dhabi Airport was not able to help us As options were limited and seats becoming unavailable on other Etihad flights out of Munich my son and his girlfriend have now been forced to pay Etihad approximately Â 500 over and above what they had already paid between them to reroute from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok instead of going to Sri Lanka 3 Flight attendants don t bother to come to ur seat when press the help button seats are vey tight and uncomfortable Our seats were toward the back the aircraft something that should not impact the service provided The seats are small in every direction and I am not a large person Seats donâ t look clean enough hence bring wipes to sanitize NOW ON TOP OF ALL YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SELECT A SEAT AFTER BOOKING Seats were not very comfortable Cabin temperature was uncomfortably hot the whole trip We were ushered into waiting area that had insufficient seating capacity After selecting my seat next to the window for sleep flight left at 8pm They have very very little legroom space where it is impossible to stretch the leg Dec12th 9 50pm Seat 64K Checkin experience was the worst with Dnata The seats we had chosen didn t recline as it was into the emergency exit we weren t told at check in So depending on the seats you picked even the worst it could easily add â 60 to the ticket price as I had to pick seats for 4 flights so I quit the booking process 3 out of 4 of my seats did not recline but the seats in front did nobody offered to try find me another seat or even cover it up better But really the seats are not larger nor more comfy Firstly the seats in the business class offer much required comfort on a long flight Toilets filthy air temperature too cold food the worst ever on all four legsEtihad has become a LOW SERVICE HIGH COST airline with their 20 kg max bag allowance their horrendous poor meals their prohibitive extra weight policy for which they charge you 40 for EVERY extra Kg the extremely uncomfortable seats with reduced reclining capacity and the rudeness of the crew the most arrogant uneducated low class stewardesses in the market I paid over 300 for these particular seats but we discovered the first leg from Abu Dhabi to Madrid was not the seats I had paid for Ordering tickets now I should pay if I would like to choose seats that wasn t before some seats were always free of charge I told the customer service that I was not happy with voucher and ask them to find me a seat in any other airline to flyout that day and so she checked in along with me to make sure that I got 2 seats but when the airline realised this they sold the seat to someone else I had reserved my seats on the Manage my Booking part of their website Seats were average plane was old except for one The gentleman in front of me had his seat laid back most of the timeCramped seats unresponsive staff on flight didn t come when pressing the call button Food aweful had the same meal for evening meal and breakfast next morning I think this is clearly human rights violation wherein they sold us tickets for the babies but did not provide seats for them I did not see any seat reclining so I don t know if this is now policy My husband chose Etihad Airways because they were offering cheap tickets and moreover the flight was a little comfortable in a way that there were not so much passengers In addition the plane itself is tight not enough legroom tickets are WAY over priced in comparison to its competitors The seats are spacious and the cabin crew cannot do enough for you This is the tip of the iceberg uncomfortable seats poor quality food being woken up to be given a bottle of water that I didnâ t really want all I wanted to do was sleep AUH Business lounge worn seats dirty toilets dry bread Web check in to allocate our seats before flights was not fully functional and there were no seats next to each other available However some companies see these seats as â premiumâ and see it as a place to squeeze a little extra profit out of their customers despite the seats not actually being all thatthe headphones attach to the power source magnetically but with no lighting near the magnets it is a mission to get the contacts to connect as they are located in a recess which is at seat level and difficult to locate On the return journey on another ageing plane my seat would not recline In principal the flight was good but the legroom for a tall person just not enough On this flight and three more which followed in the next 3 weeks profit is being chased by cutting back on anything to do with passenger comfort As it could not recline the seat was too upright not good for a 7 hour plus flight We have booked the seats 7 months before the flight date arrived at the airport 5 hours before the flightThe only reason I didn t give it five stars is because the economy seats on the A380 were not comfortable at all The marketing of the Airline offers a perception of a cut above others we found it pretty poor in all areas check in pretty slow legroom very tight seats uncomfortable lots of screens not working We pre booked our seats and didn t get them The seats were very uncomfortable to the point of being almost unbearable after 20 hours of flying But the seat aren t as wide as they could be Given the very tired state of the aircraft the lousy picture quality of the entertainment screens sound and the fact that you can t control the temperature at your seat this airline is totally outclassed by the other UAE carriers I have flown with recently The seats were very very very tight We were advised by our agent to take a seat at the back Cabin very dated but seats still comfy â Service and hostess not nice Trays meal very bad uncomfortable seats and planes are not cleaned wellWe were in Row 31 just in front of a bulkhead and the seats could not be reclined there was no extra leg room to compensate I found the seats a little uncomfortable but my family thought they were alright My seat would not recline The seats were unconfortable even on just a 6 hour flight and the food drink service not comparable with others who fly this route Incredibly uncomfortable seats It seems that those who fly business class or first class have had positive experiences with Etihad but not so much so in Economy re staff attitudes towards passengers rudeness uncomfortable seats food water Flight on a380 as usual great seats and could get a little sleep in the flat bed Seats were uncomfortable I must say I m not overly impressed with Etihad Airlines economy class not a lot of space available especially once the person in front reclines there seat We were freezing in both flights our bags did not follow all the way to Ko Samui they stayed in BKK it was supposed to follow food is really not that great seats are not so comfortableHad tonpay extra to select seat a total of 1000 â after selecting the cheapest available seats and then the checkin clerk said he could not put us together as there were no seats this despite having small children that needed to be with their parents While booking we had selected our seats so no issues with seats The business class product is actually really good as in the seat and hardware unfortunately it s the service that really needs an overhaul The trip is a tale of 2 halves the 1st leg from LHR to AUH on board the A380 was awful the legroom isn t great we were in the forward cabin 3rd row in no leg room seats wont recline Service on board was good staff very friendly and helpful but the seats were SO uncomfortable Unfortunately the seats were the old style reclining with foot rest Going to the loo in the dark was like an obstacle course one passenger thought it okay to straddle the aisle with his feet on the seat opposite and wasnâ t happy when we wanted to get past Of course the seats are the same and there is hardly any roomalthough I had plenty of leg room I am a small person the seat did not seem cushioned enough the staff were fine charming and helpfulPreviously travelled 4 return trips with this airline this time highly disappointed as seats very uncomfortable some not working and also quite shoddy We would not have brought this seat if we did not need it Some seats have no windows at all I appreciate that but 2 seats were unavailable Needless to say I was moved to a later cheaper and utterly horrid flight time the day after my booked and paid for seat No individual fans in the seats Plenty of seats available still wanted to charge me to select seats The seats are uncomfortable and entertainment system below average with nothing much to offer and legroom is not enough for comfy flight The seats were extremely uncomfortable and cramped I had had good expectations of the Dreamliner but the Etihad configuration was too cramped with hard uncomfortable seats On the journey from Abu Dhabi we were moved on to an older aircraft with very narrow isles uncomfortable seats few toilets and once again not very palatable food Seats are uncomfortable 4 On checking in at Manchester they allocated me different seats due to a change of aircraft which sounded a limp excuse Seats were not as comfortable as other airlines you need to improve that Etihad Seats were not particularly comfortable and although they convert to full bed there is no mattress topper no pillowThere was some turbulence on the sector and instead of helping out with how to make our son comfortable he just kept barking orders at us I understand that the airline could not make him book two seatsSeat had no padding in As soon I got my updated ticket I went to the website to select a seat and it won t let me select a seat andI thought the quality of service and seat comfort would be the same sadly I was mistaken Emirates offers more space better inflight entertainment and meal service plus other touches like a hot flannel Not much of a legroom though Then the first flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi a 14h flight departing late at night was on a Boeing 777 300 with very little seat space tough cushioning and no foot rest thus very uncomfortable to get any sleep What a disaster the seats were uncomfortable there was noLegroom and overall seating space is very cramped Seats were too small and legroom was uncomfortable to place my legs due to front seats strut something Cabine design is wearied with sets facing forward and seats facing rear this makes difficult to a family to travel together in the plane as there are a limited seats allowing to go close to a partner Very crowded no spare seats On my first 5 hour flight from Dhaka to Abu Dhabi there were no blankets placed on the seats which I thought was fine because I could just ask for one as it was exceptionally chilly in the aircraft Got on at Abu Dhabi and the seat spaces were ridiculously small even more so when the person in front reclines back into you The long haul from abu dhabi to Sydney the seat was uncomfortable almost no padding in seat base Quick stop here only then on to second flight this time a 777 300ER seat not so big but as it was now evening and landing early morning in BKK I decided to have a drink and then head down for some sleep So far so good then it started Etihad has a project currently goin on to increase the seats in each flight which is the reason for the new seats very less leg space exactly like a budget airline and poor seating experience it was a long flight in relatively comfy seats the food was OK not fantastic but certainly not bad On board the flight we were shown to our seats and were settling into them not the most comfortable airline seats limited leg room and awkward head rests The seats were also extremely uncomfortable On the upside the food was fine as was the the service From booking a seat to the actual flight weâ re not at all interested in helping us When they do this no notice is given and the seats you have carefully selected on 380 are changed to random seats Speaking to the couple next to me I found they had been allocated their seats automatically no extra money paid Like all airlines today it is al about profits and not passenger comfort It s not even enough for me to upgrade my seat I also didn t like the fact that when checking in online you did not have option to change seats The 6 places bar located between 1st Business classes is not a bar is not comfortable is a place to go wait for an attendant to come order the drink and get back to your seat easier to call the attendant from the seat I had anticipated having to pay an additional AU 300 to AU 400 to get a flight the next day if a seat was available When I complained to the Airline they simply talked cheeky However we cannot guarantee any particular seat The two aunties travelling with us move to those seats which as it turns out are EMPTY ROWS at the back of the plane On the Boeing 777 the seats we selected A and B at the rear of the plane were more cramped than on Emirates So for the extra money spent for business class for larger seats and lounge access I was put on a VERY economy bus that left 80 minutes after it was meant to without apology or explanation We booked exit row seating on the Dreamliner and found the seats to be very uncomfortable Paid for a better seat it did not recline told nothing could be done Seats were particularly uncomfortable and our only saving grace was that we had paid extra for a better seat configuration Of course very long and the seat was not the softest The couple were previously in a 4 seat arrangement and had not asked if they could move they actually moved seats before the plane had taken off When I realised that my seat was actually in a row of 3 with no extra legroom I went to find the air stewardess who just basically told me to find a manager myself she was too busy to sort it The lounge was very crowded did not have enough seats Seats were more comfy than BA or Virgin economyThe plane from CDG to AUH an Airbus A380 was perfect not very noisy nice TV sets quite comfy seats To cap it all off on one of the regular visits to move my seat for me the steward managed to knock a full glass of red over me Basically I made a complaint and said You changed our flight which we don t mind but changing our seats is totally unacceptable Where should I start first the seats are tight and no leg room So when we turned up at the airport the agent advised we may not be seated together Less and less opportunity to pre book seats free of charge at time of booking I checked with her about our seat changes due to a change in aircraft type never wanted to explain what happened I as a code share passenger wasn t allowed to select a seat online called up their customer serviceDespite my Platinum status on Jet Airways I as a code share passenger wasn t allowed to select a seat online I made a bid for an extra seat on my return trip Seats were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable This meant I had to watch these friends and families take the seats that should have kept the However the seats we chose were exactly the same as the others in the cabin with no benefits at all Etihad has this really stupid policy of not allowing seat selection chargeable prior to 24 hours and after 24 hours they open only limited seats for choosing from i didn t hear from my bid so i booked to be safe a seat with extra legroom 8 hours before my flightwhen choosing seats many show as unavailable but when you board there are many empty The seat can be turned into a flat bed which is the best thg after a long and tiring journey We were able to check in online with no problem and our seats were already placed together despite us not pre paying for this I started the process of returning to my seat it takes about a minute to get dressed and wash your hands when the stewrtess starts pounding at the door Etihad offered excellent price though bit irritating to still have to pay more to chose a seat like a budget airline when checked in finally The seats in particular were uncomfortable It ll be nice to have 3 seats and lay down to sleep because it is a 13 14 hour flight you will not be allowed to select seats even24 hours before departure for your journey having connecting flights Also post seat selection you are not allowed to check in or change seats Old plane noisy small uncomfortable seat space for business class flight plane type changed 3 times before we left The seats in business class especially in bed mode are uncomfortable the airplane was quite small and the seats quite tightAll flights were good only small turbulence on each When making a miles redemption booking I progressed on to make a seat selection without realizing that I was actually paying for each seat selected The only saving grace was the large movie selection on the seat back video players Here is why Etihad has smaller legroom ares no food choice serving our seats as the last one with only one meal choice out of three at the beginning very slow check in not the best in flight entertainment all flights were delayed multi stop flight Seat and business class varies a lot depending onSeats flatbeads not as good nor food I have been reading reviews on booking the best seats on B787 9 Dreamliner to avoid any inconvenience So in response to a complaint about their lack of any compassion following the passing of my father in law and the need to amend travel plans and also a declared medical condition which they requested and had proof of requiring additional legroom after nearly a month of chasing and chasing this was the response they sent Thought this new plane would be filled to capacity however to our pleasant surprise many seats were vacantOne thing we never understand is there were so many empty first class economy plus extra leg room seats The first issue was we were unable at any time to pre book our seats via the KLM or Etihad online sites for our return journey Legroom space is not sufficient it must be at least little more than the normal on long journey flight 15 hours Seat cushion must be changedand as of now very thin and uncomfortable there might be some mechanical technical constraints in providing a more comfortable seat cushion Poor the entertainment was not much better very basic seat comfort to tight and uncomfortable loading of the aircraft at Abu Dhabiwe went into a quiet room that was large and spacious with seat that were re cloned like beds and managed to get a little sleep as we had a stopover of 9 hours All seats with extra leg room are available to be booked for an extra charge Have travelled a few times with this airline to and from Melbourne find the hostesses to be very accomodating planes are clean although a little old great value for money and the option to bid on extra seats if availableLetâ s just say it is not Emirates the class of service was mediocre at best the seat of the planeWe were seated in the rear section which was half empty however no one was allowed to switch to the empty front row unless they paid so the good seats were not used Only thing that put me off was that we were not able to upgrade our seats as weâ d booked through a travel agent We had a lot of turbulences but this isnâ t the fault of the Airline Stopped over in Abu Dhabi and ended up on the same plane in the same seats From the gorgeous girl at check in who offered us a bank of 4 seats for 2 of us so that we had more comfort to te stewardesses for whom nothing was too much trouble This was one of the longest flights I have been on in awhile but the seats in business class folded down into a comfy bedYou Cannot Sleep in Business Class even after paying Good Amount Seat are as you find in Economy ClassAs for the seats maybe a little more room would have been nice but as the flight wasnâ t full there was plenty of room to stretch out so not to bad howeverThe seats are incredibly small and uncomfortable especially for someone like myself who is aroundâ The plane were both very uncomfortable the seats were not reclining and no comfort kit or baby toys were offered as Emirates and Qatar ALWAYS do all the good seats were not taken and we asked if we could move no only if you pay extra so they sat vacant all flight surprised that I can t choose a seat at either booking time or online check in They have a very tight space for seats to the point where my seatmate accidentally tipped over my glass of wine all over me Prior to taking off a young couple ran to the 2 seats in front of us and spent the 11 hour journey with their seats fully extended which made our journey quite uncomfortable Seats of new Boeing are not comfortable at all Very uncomfortable seats on Airbus 380 for first leg of our journey Food average white wine not very coldOn the outgoing journey my seat would not respond to any control despite the attendant doing his best to rectify itGood comfortable seats decent service food poor no drinks but on time For 10 hours flight only good thing are seatsLegroom is good not the best I had but pretty good Had to push the wheel chair all the way through the Isle to seat row 16 the seats allotted at the checkin counter My seat didn t recline and I need to sit straight for the whole 16 hrs of journey worst experience The airline seated all five of them separately none of them got the seat I had paid for in spite of having paid extra money no cushion left seat reclines at its own will we went back to end of aircraft and asked for some juice curt reply came that they will start serving in 5 minutes basically NO and go back to your seatOnly issue was seats that backed into the toilet block will make sure we avoid them next time ð Online check in was a pain as we were flying as a family of four 2 minor kids and the airline website only offered us different seats in all four directions Their flights are ALWYAS delayed most of their entertainment systems dont work legroom is terrible and they are terrible at customer service I complained to a senior officer also saying I have paid for the seatThe seat was uncomfortable someone in my raw tried to recline the seat and it broke Seats were filthy cramped and barely reclined 6 and when we return the flight is small and it is terrible noise in flight when landing and take off Air India planes are like 25 years old seats are terrible No touch screen entertainment no remote control works as they are very oldâ i showed the receipt and confirmation email also but they had taken money and issued the seat already to someone else I was refused the same as they said those seats got released Also i was getting annoyed with the man in front of me who kept pushing his seat backwards The enetetertainment system as broken the seat divider was flimsy and filthy But even with 3 seats to myself it was awful the interior is filthy and the seats are broken in some way or other the food looks and tastes like recycled garbage no in flight entertainment other than some old magazines and news papers the staff areâ I managed to sleep during most of the flight even if my seat was the last one before the toilet positioned next to the aisle and therefore get kicked most of the timesWorst seats on a plane I have ever experienced After I had booked the flight I read several comments about how dirty the AI seats were and how poor the service was Seats were warn foot rests and walls with many scuff marks toilets can be best described as having a lick and promise to clean Nightmare flight horrible seats tight and dirty old movies which ainâ t good terrible inflight entertainment The seats are low flatThey said the flight is over sold the seat kept falling bothering the person behind me so they found me crappy tight seat in the emergency exit row in the back The planes were old and the seats were quite worn and dirty Worst airline uncomfortable seats do not recline completely Only complaint was the noise as it seemed like the engine was being revved hardOur seats were pre booked and they gave them to someone else meaning we had to sit in a row of seats that had been left un ocupied because one seat was broken Very bad customer service trying to book pay seats My seat was broken and looked like it had been left for a few years in a garbage dump complete with sweat stains on the arm rests and an absolutely nauseating smell the likes of which Iâ ve never experienced on an airplane before andbut they refuse seats size and space was bigger then jet flight because it s 777 boing aircraft and old one with different type of seats food wasImagine sitting on a 6 and a half hours flight with poorly reclining seats Even 2 hours before you cant select seat and even boarding counter person cant edit your middle worse system alloted seats Seat to Delhi were a bit dirty but fine on our way back seats were comfortable and lay flat Looks like its run by a bunch of bribe accepting morons who want to just loot and trouble passengers and give them their life s worst flying experience after this nightmare i got a bad seat for both flights and the woman on the check inThe seat was so dirty that when the stewardess came around with the hot towels I used it to was the complete headrest and arms The seats are horrible on the aircraft the entertainment system was not working in certain rows the USB charging port was missing there was a hole in my seat where the USB port should haveThe flight was comfortable but the seats and equipment was pathetic Suddenly we we told are seats were 20 rows back The plane was old and there was this constant noise i keep hearing at the emergency door on the 2nd Emergency door on the left during take off and Landing After reaching my seat I found someone prior traveled had vomited Some snippets from the plane People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours couple guys would stand in the pathway chatting for 30 40 minutes Interiors like electronics dashboard seats are in bad condition A COCKROACH was running around the seat just in front of my face It made noise as if we were sitting in a boat I had 5 hours flight without TV With poor legroom cleanliness is poor seats are worn out some are bend or tilted some with torn upholsterySeats were decently comfortable and toilets had everything they needed The check in was good however the seats in the economy class barely had any leg room The plane seats were SO uncomfortable I barely got any sleep They had put my 5 year old girl sitting next to a random passenger on a 2 seat together configuration But not the same poor attitude to charge extra for seats etc Rear Toilets Seat cover was falling not staying up They had the best times for departure and arrival however the food on board was not good and the service was poor films were ok and seats were okIt was a B777 flight and had full lie flat seats in business class Once I boarded I find that fight was not properly cleaned seats were uncomfortable and poorly repaired like sarkari bus services IFE didn t work food was inedible seat broken they got me to Delhi in one piecemy wife and i booked seats well in advance both ways and both times we were seated apart a complete disaster of an excuse for an airline check in at delhi completely chaotic you would have to get there 5 hours in advance to get through the queues never again But to my agony the seat offered to me had a broken seat and nonetheless they bothered to change it for me in a half empty flight They sold it anyway and as soon as the person in front of me leaned back the seat back fell onto my tray table injuring my hand and spilling water When I entered the flight a woman sat in the seat I had bought Most seats donâ t match and have extremely faded fabrics The check in staff at Air India said nothing they could do one of our seats was broken NOTHING worked broken seats with cracks fixed with tape I usually have a problem with legroom in economy but dreamlinerThree guesses same problems seat plug broken and head seat also missing plug end There were no seats and we were left standing and exhausted for the time The seats seemed to have more legroom than the planes I had recently been flying in America Coming back to NY when I went to recline my seat it fell in lap of guy behind me I further challenged this customer service rep and asked how Air India thought it was acceptable to change my seats and have my children sitting elsewhere on the plane to which he answered apologies for any inconvenience After I paid extra for front row seat at the counter the lady said you paid for a window seat and not a front row seat Late arrival Inflight entertainment system broken for my seat Another ai flight from VIE to DEL this time with a motivated crew the movie selection is very limited but the seat pitch levels that But a 13 year old aircraft with extremely dated or torn seats and entertainment systems that did not work throughout flight was really disappointing On landing the flight was also delayed almost two hours we were left standing in the aisles for 15 minutes before being told to sit back in our seats no particular reason gone After the brawl and time wasting I was given a middle seat saying that all Aisle window seats were full but turns out there were Never seen an airline blame their customer first forces me on a cramped seat where I said that I will not participate in emergency procedures they didn t even tell me about puts their employees in preferred seats while paid customers get run around Food served was below par and must be addressed as it discomforts passengers on non stop long flights of 16 hours This kind of matters when you spend 20 hours in a seat and are bored The aircraft was noisy maybe due to that missing floor panel at my seat there were 40 seats vacant in the flight still window seat was denied by airline The seats in Air India recline fully so that you can go horizontal but the seats themselves were a bit hard making it slightly more difficult to sleep while doing so I seriously doubt that this aircraft has had any money spent on the passenger cabin since put into service Controls of those seats are broken and cannot move things properly The aircraft was in dire need of repairs torn seats non functioning audio video system and smelly restrooms My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours I havenâ t been refunded the money I payed for the seat There was a duct below my seat which was blowing really hot air throughout the flight The advertised flat seats are not quite flat and my controls were balky Air India gets poor marks for their planes with bad seats and worn interior to the quality of inflight entertainment â plane felt tired and well used â seatsThe staff then pilot got involved and told me the broken seat was a safety riskAfter a massive argument involving the check in supervisors we were given two seats together next to the emergency exit and the usual seating supplement was waived they said they have no seats togetherSo in this particular flight from Delhi to Chennai I forgot my Kindle on my seat My neighbor had a tough time with his seat not working properly It was much more difficult to put back without getting out of your seat to monkey it back in Otherwise the ground staff had given us couple middle seats in DIFFERENT rows when we had asked for aisle and middle seats The bus waited outside the gate for a period of almost 25 minutes for the balance passengers only two passengers finally boarded the bus at 5 43 am After being seated in the plane for over an hour we were deplaned with the announcement that the flight has been cancelled due to operational reasons It was only when my flights were ending that I noticed the screens behind each seat were covered up with seat covers so don t expect loads of legroomThere are so many things wrong here no proper customer service even paid seats are not guaranteed Seats were shaking not comfortable at all Today the button to activate the reclining seat was completely missing The push button to recline the seat was missingThe planes are not properly cleaned and the seats have not padding But there was black stuff smeared all over the plane looked like it hadnâ t been cleaned in years and all the seats were worn with tears and just didnâ t look clean The seats had extremely scare cushions and felt like sitting on metal My Seats never worked I expect if I pay for a seat and give it to an other person without any refund It used to better than what business is today except the seats Seat is hard and extremely uncomfortable We chose seats towards the front for which we had to pay nominal charges other airlines charge much more When we get on flight we were told that those seats were assigned to another passenger and asked us to go talk to air hostess also we found out this is not direct flight to EWR getting stopped in Ahamadabad Ladies in our group find themselves like seating in a cheap bar So here is my review for all to see 1 The planes are so old that sockets are falling out of the seat and the seats don t work properly The entertainment systems did not work for half the seats but when the person in front puts their seat back it tilts too far and itâ s most uncomfortable Except for the width of the seat nothing is good in this business class and I was shocked by the entertainment system and the seat itself Taking off was the scariest part as we feel the turbulence After 4 uncomfortable hours I saw many staff people were in comfortable seats which was not offered to me as a paying customer One of the least comfortable flights plane was dated and seats felt quite hard with minimal cushioning Why did the steward lie about the reasons for the change of seats The seats were a little tired looking but there was more than enough legroom which I was pleasantly surprised about Worst airline you can fly when i flew in to India from vancouver and needed a connection flight Air india hosts took my economy seats and two luggages a piece I Was traveling with a handicap in a lot of pain and they wouldnt allow her to get a front row seat NOT EXIT ROW front row The only good thing about the 787 is that the seats are lie flat with good legroom and width Not sure why they spend 300 million on a plane and skimp on the seats The seats did not function properly the gentleman next me was required to move before takeoff as seat was broken After web checkin with sequence number 2 with seat 3D first row aisle seat 48 hours prior to scheduled departure as per Air India rules shocked to see after boarding that the same seat was alloted to another passengerMine fell between the seatsThe aircraft that took me from ICN to HKG is filled with and smells of dust and the entertainment on my seat is broken including the USB charger beside it First the onboard entertainment system didn t work for all the 3 seats we were in row 38 four even elderly and all were scattered at B E and even at check in counter he said his power to edit has been removed and all seats are paidAI changed my 10K Business seats to 9C Not much help as the seat will remain flat and never come in upright position except by manual help of two strong male flight attendants I did not want to touch anything My seat was broken as was the arm of the seat The problem in this aircraft is that to accommodate more passenger seats the leg room has been squeezes Otherwise the seats are quite hard and no back support In fact one other passenger 2 seats to my right reported that his system wasn t even working Except for seat comfort in their Dreamliner Jet all other parameters pathetic Seat 19J entertainment system was not working seat 19K right hand handle was ripped and seat reclining was not working we raised this issue with air hostess she said she will look in to itEven the seats recline without pressing the reclining button Anything kept next to you just slips down the seat and is inaccessible IF THEY DROP DOWN ON THE SIDE OF SEAT IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM Then unfortunately the passengers around us were talking loud and were constantly eating something or the other such as Khakraas etc which they brought along with them passing it back and forth between the seats making a mess of our seats The one I was seated was shaky and kept me rather irritated until the flight landed In order to ask for refunds for the seats I stayed on their line twice for at least 35 minutes for each callThe plane was not particularly clean seats were cramped and the inflight entertainment did not work at all The video system in few seats didn t work well My flight also had about 3 hours of severe turbulence The seats were a bit harder than expected however I found out upon arrival that hotel beds are also harder than expectedJust telling where is the seat and no smile on face I was also sitting in a middle seat that I did not select when I booked online The seat stayed upright through the 12 hour flight as it was delayed for 3 hours as well I bought legroom in advance much cheaper compared to other companies I flew business class on the way back in economy and really there wasn t much of a difference except for the full reclining seat in business class and aâ To my horror I flew the same route in October this year in the same seat and the system still had not been fixed and the handset was also smashed once again I complained but there was nothing they could do my go air flight got cancelled and it was the only flight with seat s available on so kind of my only option On the flight from Chicago the overhead light did not work for me or the middle seat passenger Any respected airlines wouldn t do that but if it happens it would at least upgrades its passenger seat to a business one and this didn t happen so I paid for specific seats for our return flight their site says if the seats are unavailable you get your money back Many seats were vacated because the screen were not working Air India didn t even acknowledge child passenger 2 since I was traveling with kid despite requesting a seat with no co passenger they put us up in congested isle seat whereas gave a three seater to a young white teenage passenger 3 Despite requesting juice air hostess denied serving it for 8 he out of 16 citing a lame reason that bar is locked 4 When I protested and said â why did you tell us it was broken caused tension the whole of check in and made another passenger feel really bad uncomfortableâ he basically shooed me away like he was swatting a fly away Pathetic flight conditions terrible experience new flights are required as most of the seats are worn out and tv screens and remotes not working and also I had to wait for the flight staff to arrive to allocate the seat if any Dirty cabins entertainment system not working on three seats in a row plus no pillows on the international flight to New Delhi and awful food choices on both international flight and domestic connection New Delhi to Bangalore In flight entertainment system did not work in my seat When I arrived for check in I was told there was no seat at all for me but if I wanted seats together theyâ d have to charge me I am used to being cramed in small seats but the Air India seats were wide and the rows were tapered out so there was plenty of leg room in all of the seats Business Class had NO passengers and Economy also surprisingly had most seats going empty The entertainment system was difficult to extract from its stowage between the seats the rubber sheath covering some cables beneath the seats was sliding and was pretty hot I had pre booked my seats and PAID the airline on their website more than 1 month in advance for emergency exit seats in row 11 2 seats and row 12 3 seats During flight we felt very hot inside the plane even after fully opening the air conditioning vent for our seats The plane was dirty screens broken remotes missing security issues of children laying in the aisles jumping on the seats luggage in the aisles flight attends gone missing a good part of the time people standing in the aisles for hours at a time despite warnings to useâ On board the flight we were shown our seats and we were not happy to be seated at the on the same row as the wings of the plane Also three of the 5 seats we had booked s entertainment systems didn t work They requested the whole row to swap seats to enable the baby to have access Check in good no problems flight left on time seats a little cramped but ok as we are not the big BTW i paid for seat 50 but didn t get the seat Legroom is average and may be a problem for a people above five five to seat in a non aisle seat The seat was leaning forward through out the journey and it was awefully bad The seats did recline a lot more than in economy but were still pretty uncomfortable as I sleep on my side Seat was hard as rock But on airport they told that there arent any seat available and they cant find any booking for it Also i was told that 9 infants are travelling and they allocated already to others but in the flight all 4 5 seats were allocated to other people with no babies infants and couple and mothers with infantsDuring the initial booking I had blocked seats for the family so we are all seated together Looked as if the seats have never ever been cleaned since they bought the aircraft Firstly my window seat was changed to an isle seat saying there was some issue with my seat The movie screens not working on some seats Flew return Dec Jan 2019 direct Sat in seats with extra leg rom in economy i purchased pre reserved seat service and amount was deducted twice for the same seats Let my partner and 20 month old son have 3 seats moved to a seat which had no person seating in it but was later told to move so crew could sit in it It just makes so much more sense to give out the seats in a serial order when several people are travelling together I changed the seat for the third time the TV worked 30 minutes then went off My Web check in seat was changed the seat which was assigned to me was broken so the air hostess moved me to another seat When we get to the airport we have different seats in the back of the plane The seats are worn offer nearly no padding lack full recline no storage cubby inadequate leg room for an average 5â 10â person and are absolutely filthy After much protestation they told us nothing they could do and to sort it out with the passenger on board and see if he would move seats While we were getting off the plane at Chennai one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry on bag in the restricted overhead compartment Seat control audio or other features don t work entertainment system was not working in most of seats and in those where it was working the headphones were not working 5 Plane was ancient and dirty seats were worn down The passengers are loaded into the plane and made to wait for an hour or more with no or minimal air conditioning The carpets were filthy seat backs painted by a child broken remotes I was very uncomfortable seating in between of two gentlemen Was surprised to see old and very worn seats stains on the floor and seats broken remote for tv sticky remotes on the tv next to me On landing at Madurai the Air India bus which took us to the terminal was not air conditioned and had very little seating A bland trip without any outstanding difference between economy and Business class apart from the seat space I was not sure whether my seat was shortI overcame of the shock that my 7 year old have to sit separately with an advice from customer executive that I have to request for seat change to sit together due to software issue Malfunctioning tv screens rickety tray tables and seats that don t stay reclined seem to be par for the course with Air India at least on the 777 s that fly the SFO DEL route It is an very old A319 8 seat in business class Air India has great food the same identical uncomfortable seats and leg space as all other European or American Carriers but lower prices Condition of flight was very bad seat was not at all moving Catering quality truly awful food and choices 3 cleanliness of seats 4 VIE seats won t reclineFirst and foremost the eating tray was unclean with stains so did one of the seats non existent on the seatbut I had to lay a blanket on the seat because the seat made me itchy The seats dont have properâ Old aircraft with worn and uncomfortable seats and nothing much to write about on board Seat was uncomfortable and could not tilt it backSeat in front of mine was labeled â do not useâ with a big sticker on the headrest Further as we fumbled inside the flight we all 3 of us had been assigned different seats this has never happened in any other flights before And although their seat reservation opens 4 hours prior to boarding all the staff wants is for passengers to pay to get seats Average flight with decent legroom for which u dont payextra but other things like and food are below average The seats were very uncomfortable for a four hours flight To start when I printed my boarding passes our seats got changed and my husband and I didn t sit together After booking it doesn t allow me to login to my account to select a seat I asked for change of seat air hostess asks me to search a vacant seat on my own The seats were thinner than those of other airlines but there was no compromise in comfort â There was no control over passengers who were out of their seats blocking the aisle and draped over others seatbacks It seemed as though many other passengers were careless about where they sat in relation to their allocated seats and thisâ Though its high cost airline and most of the seats go vacant due to thisI feel sorry for the guy sitting behind me as my seat was gone too much back when I use the reclining button Your legs don t hit the seat in front On checking in the man at the counter told us that my wife and I couldn t sit together as we were one of the last to check in and there were no two seats together left My seat was having some mechanical issues I complained when the plane was on the ground in London but nothing was done WHile searching the seat I realized that the person on counter printed boarding pass with as per my seat booking but had manually put in a number which was middle seat though I had booked isle I was particularly unlucky with a grandma trying to change a toddler s diaper in the seat But by the time we finished our food the turbulence started and it continued till the time of landing at Indore Airport Next during the flight from Mumbai to Delhi the flight attendant urged me and other passengers to change seats to other places at the emergency exit When we boarded the flight I could immediately see that my seat was very tatty and the seat back would not go upright properly The seat cushions are thin and grubby many arm rests droop down to the seat The seats were really uncomfortable and in need of reupholstering the seats were uncomfortable The outbound flight from Madrid to Kathmandu via Delhi went off without any issues and we were allocated the seats as booked I had to wait hardly for about 15 minutes to get my boarding pass and the seat was allotted only in the 17th row in spite of my repeated requests I paid for an upgrade and the difference between business and economy is only a slight seat size difference that do not even have leg rests or entertainment There were some confusions on the flight home with our family four not being seated together Seats aren t so luxurious and the plane is clean on an average The air hostess started serving food and when she came to my seat told me Non veg is over now you will get only veg What a way to put it across I am not comfortable on the seatOn both the flights the experience was not worth mentioning except for the seating comfort The seat i got was not reclining Seats on a cheap bus are better than Air India seats Air hostess held it for some time before moving the passengers to a different seat with not such a re assuring remark that if the oxygen starts coming out we could be in danger There was actually room to stretch my legs a bit under the seat although the seat did not recline much at all Seats are the least good of any economy I have flown since 2010 The Economy seats are no lesser than business class seats of B737 or A320 seats are not comfortable there is a vibration where i kept my feetNone of the TVs worked in rows 30 32 across all seats in spite of repeated resets by the crew Seats were not comfortable After about 15 minutes of standing one elderly gentleman lost his cool and shouted at the airline staff saying that at least we were better of seated in the lounge than being made to stand they would not come at your seat The flight was Jam Packed but took off on time and the Experience efficiency of the staff was visible by the way how they could manage the passengers to get seated on time for take off Though there was enough leg space seats were uncomfortable The seats are small and super uncomfortable there was practically scant air conditioning in the rear of the plane where we were seated The seats were stained and the overall experience was rather poor At my seat 20K I found a panel between the floor and the lower portion of the wall missing resulting in a huge gaping dark hole right next to me Solution take another seat between other passengers for meals which were terrible Only thing lacking was in flight entertainment and seats are comfortable for 2 hour travel time Our seats did not reclineSeating isn t comfortable is crammed and seat inclination is not upto standard All attempts to change the seats during web check in and at the check in counter at the airport failed The seats will be uncomfortable A demand for change of seats was declined too The business class tickets purchased offered no business class privileges and Seats My seat would not recline fully and wouldn t come back after that little recline The web site will force you to pay which I had to do eventually because of the seats allocated automatically were highly uncomfortable It is our national carrier and would love to encourage but it has most uncomfortable seats average food TV is very far Seat was not comfortable As usual we did not get the seats we selected online Because the planes are so old there was no padding left on my seatThe plane was old and not as up to date as some of the other airlines the seat next to me wasâ They claim that they will confirm the seat only at the check in counter that is what I understood The seat did not flatten out and it was very uncomfortable sleeping The entertainment system of that entire blocks around 12 20 seats surrounding my seat was faulty and did not work throughout the flight There was plenty of legroom but I did not find the seats too comfortableâ why can t I pay for the seats also they said Sorry we would at worst be 2 seats together and 2 seats together elsewhere Air hostesses were tying to help through making some seat adjustments to no avail The seats are very small with little legroom and with Indian culture not understanding comfortable body contact you will likely be uncomfortable When i asked the air hostess to help me with my seat she asked me figure it out myself When I called to request seats together they said no problem they have three seats together available but that theyâ d call me back in an hour because the department was unavailable at the moment due to high call volume and they never called me back so when I called the next dayA little more legroom would have been better The plane was an old A321 as notified so was not surprised by the cramped seat space but I wished that the seats were a bit wider and somewhat better padded Aeroplane was quite good even if poor Entertanment not many movies and a little bit old entertainment system 2 New Delhi to Singapore small aeroplane small legroom no entertainment at all it seemed a low cost flight for a 5 5 hours flight the seats were smaller I am a medium size person 170 lbs but I could not put the tray table down since they hit my thighs the plane was dirty the seat did not lay flat and did not have cushioning like the first plane Air India does not allow you to book seats quoting your Star Airlines member Airlines Frequent flier program say Thai Airways noisy very few uncomfortable seats with direct views on the tarmac Seats Not very comfortable but enough leg space Seat space was minimal the in flight entertainment basic and inaudible and the cabin crew remote unfriendly and disinterested Air India do not let you choose your seat on an ordinary website you have to dig and get into it which is absurd Lots of passengers faced issue wherein Legroom space good one can easily move in and out Seat comfort Pathetic This is one of the longest flight 16hrs and you expect a comfort and these seats are nothing close to any comfort Well we didnâ t get the seats nor a refund How can someone sells business class and not have lay flat seats in 2018 I would probably give the same opinion like the rest crew is reluctant food is average to low seatBecause of the noise I couldn t make out what the crew said during their announcements The longer flights had nicer seats the shorter flights had basic seats that were a bit more used and not as comfortable The seats in the Economy class are a little cramped for long journeys given the fact that the travel time is justâ The airplane has very uncomfortable seats you can feel springs or something in the seatsâ Air India was pretty average in terms of everything food seats check in My table to put my food on got stuck and would not come out so I had to eat from a tray on my lap Coming back my seat would not recline into a bedthe seats were clean and comfortable and i didnt realized when my journey had ended Seat did not had any comfort There was a lot of turbulence as wellTravelled the national carrier after a very long time was relived to see good comfortable seats decent legroom Be careful prior to purchase ticket at the end of the day you will pay the more amount with less service compare to full fare flight airline do not get trapped in fare difference of INR 1000 or near by compare to full fare airline they will say low cost airline and selling cheap fare at the end may not work for you While I am aghast at this experience and utter disregard to a genuine grievance I hope the idiots at SpiceJet customer relations and the airhostess enjoy a satisfactory meal at my moneys expense while I now head out to buy my child a toy bag which she missed because I was refused a service which I had paid for Low cost does not necessarily mean bad or not so good service My money felt wasted it did not even work for priority boarding A horrible airline choice never to be made again even if no other choice in the world exists I asked them why they had cancelled my flight as I had not paid any money to change it yet I HAVE STILL NEVER RECEIVED THIS MONEY BACK Pathetic low cost airline DO NOT fly with them unless you have money to throw away The staff refused to allow waiting passengers to even go to a nearby hotel at our own expenses The lunch provided was such poor quality that some of us refused it only I was not sure about travelling with spice jet and this incident gave me confidence that not to travel with spice jet only bunch of idiots there to rip u off with money also when I booked my other flight tickets they wants to charge me 750 rs as a no show charge Spice jet should be ashamed to treat their paying customers like this I am publicizing this to show how these so called low cost airlines are exploiting this kind of situation When I said that my cabin baggage contained food and water and that I would eat them before I board he refused my check in without paying for extra kilos even though I showed him the items Not only that even at the check in counter the staff member kept trying to foist it off on me recounting the benefits and urging me to upgrade I felt at that moment as though I was in a KFC Burger King counter refusing the extra cheese toppings they are hell bent on selling me 2 The best thing about this flight is the ticket price which is very cheap and since the journey is only for little more than an hour the cramped leg space did not bother me much I was also disgusted to discover right at the end of the booking process that there was a 1000 rupee extra charge for paying He denied and we re not ready like he is doing some kind of Favor to me seriously Even after paying money this is not an Experience I expect I had the lock cut off and the money that had been in my suitcase was gone Spicemax is not value for money and responses were pathetic when asked in the counter In fact the airport staff was so rude that they took away my US passport and refused to give until I pay the money One of the worst budget airlines Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us more than a month later comfortable flight good food but they charge for everything and fool around by saying that they are a low cost airlines but still I am waiting for my money I called up lots of timeDelays happen economical airlines do give less options I can manage with all that but not with insensitive and poor customer service but she was rude arrogant and blunt and said pay and pls leave mam Our checked in baggage was tampered with valuable jackets expensive perfumes chocolates were stolen Waste of money The food was also bad and would rate it as poor value for money I request never have any food in this spicejet Airline totally waste costly n taste nothing street food are better then this Spicejet Airline 45 minutes spicejet said they have cancelled my ticket and refunded the money Repeated requests were denied and I didnï ½t get my money back I ended up driving to Bangalore instead to catch a later flight home and spent more money that I should have Extremely poor food and service for extra money paid These cheap airline has very low level cheap strategies like they free seats avialble only in middle of each row that means if your 2 3 4 or more family member then you will get single seat in the middle of every row Using unfair practices to extract money from psssangers for hand baggage The weird part is they are so keen on making money that they are stupid enough to allow you to web checkin for 2 tickets but won t let you 2 consecutive seats because they want to make money out of every aisle and window seat I will now seriously consider Spicejet ahead of Indigo whose arbitrariness and money minded approach has put me off So in short if you are on low budget fly SPICE jet Very bad and cheap service from SpiceJet worst ever airlines dont take these flights just coz its cheap price its cheap in every thing I would rather book another airline that leaves at scheduled by paying extra instead of being misled and made to wait 4 hrs at the airport It was really a bad airline choice SpiceJet cancelled my flight 15 days in advance due to weather and they say they wonï ½t give the money back Worst budget airline EVER I felt cheated as we had paid extra charges for getting special services When you say Sorry we regret the inconvenience caused at least try to make up to the customer rather than making more money out of the customer s inconvenience that s what this airline is all about they try to keep the ticket price low but try to make the most by fleecing unsuspecting passengers I paid extra for premium seats but even that was waste of moneyAs above this is a blatant manipulation attempt to try to psychologically program people into purchasing things from them Low cost and low standard if u r just 5 min late after getting boarding pass all my money got wasted 0 performance spice jetMy guess is they were in cahoots with the drivers and probably got a cut of the money we paid to get out of Pondicherry You will loose lot of money in calling that pathetic customer care So spicejet earns Rs 200 by stealing money and not returning to its passenger And of course it was useless asking the beggar airline for a hotel compensation as they had no money I asked from flight attendent regarding for fine they denied to return back my money They hit a new low in my eyes with this cheapest of cheap tactics They re constantly attempting to get people to spend money and subconsciously influence them into making purchases that they for the entire 2 1 2 hour flight would every ten minutes bring the food cart down the aisle asking over and over again Would you like to buy something I have travelled with Spicejet in the past and this was by far the worse experience dealing with Deepika Chudasama at AMD airport At least seats were clean mostly because of no food or drinks being served unless paid for So guys please don t book Spice max They are just grabbing money from you This disaster cost me 25 000 rupees as I turned up at the airport with no flight Thwy want to mint money by screwing their own customers while service is 3rd class We all know Spicejet is low budget airline but does it mean exteme low quality and lowest quality of services Worst than a cheap bus travel in India Dear Spicejet Low cost doesn t mean low standard at all I always thought that low cost airlines does not mean great customer service and never expected too much but not anymore wah what an airline no food was sold being a low cost airline at 25 grand return ticket and above aa group of kesari and sf the male passengers were completely drunk casuing a mayhem and danger even to the crew of the airline Must avoid if not for cheap travel so if u are planning to travel by Spice jet Think again as it s not a value to money deal to me All the food items inside the Flight is very expensive not worth for money I received no email from FlightNetwork no instruction or notification that they had my money I decided to avoid late night flight from cheapest airlines From the UK we spent over ï ½50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded it means still money given the hard up sell again on this flight with the promise of Priority check in and then received an email telling me that owing to sever congestion at Jaipur airport we had to be there 2 1 2 hours before scheduled departure People are buying tickets by their money but they are not getting any service then why people will spend their money for this kind of airlines in my opinion to get a fist row seat on 15 th of this month 2018 jan 2900 plus 1000 plus 399 seat meal combo for onward and return 19 th 2100 plus1000 plus 399 altogether 7600 for a return leaving kochi at 1 10 pm and returning at 3 pm in afternoon just is not value for money unless desperately short of time or funded by sombody else or on busiuness official dont spend that kind of money kindest rgds to spice jet staff thank uThey destroy valuable luggage charge a huge amount of money for little extra luggage and don t take care of it The worst part is that they kept most of the seats as paid during online check in so you will have to part of the long queue at the airport I feel it very bad on learning that some of the Airlines are wasting money on packing and reducing as also compromising with the quality or quantity of meals we had to pay for a meal and our seats together this resulted in a more expensive flight that expected The problem is the attitude to earn money even in the flight when the aircraft is air borne Even Jet airways when it was going down refunded the money in a weeks time Again disappointed after paying top price Slice jet improved over time with lost of facilities at low cost but i just couldn t used it as it was not able added to any of my onboard value added services wastage of money This company Lied about the price of the flight Ignored my emails I sent 5 emails to the customer service people and was ignored in all of them and used extremely intense brainwashing and advertising techniques to try to manipulate people into spending money Will be better off paying little extra to other airline to avoid inconvenience stress and extra unnecessary expenses It was left removed during the whole flight and the attendants were busy selling the snacks I still ended up losing Rs 25 000 on new flight ticket cost alone This feels like it is becoming hopeless as we have some expensive items in the bags The Airline is low budget airline which doesn t give food on board for free We decided not to pay this extra money Very bad option even the bags have to checked out and again checked in What baffled me was they kept my money of Rs 44000 without refunding after so called informing as per them on 12th Aug very low standard service after paid cost like full service aircraft are very old and need over haul maintenance of aircraft is very poor only plus point is ontimeWorst airline can t web check in waste of money my family tried web checking in from Dubai to Pune even that web check in2 ignore you if you ask for justice 3 try to subconsciously manipulate you into spending more money on their company in the future by attempting to psychologically program people with advertisements and 4 Seats were very low quality gap between the seats were very narrow The pricing is confusing as you are not too sure what the final cost of the ticket will be When we spend money the least we expect is a decent aircraft Due to this delay many passengers from the plane lost our connection flights and had to pay a substantial amount of money to change our flight tickets I fought with them for nearly one month and recently I received an email that money has been refunded to credit card account While selling he totally missed to tell us that power banks are not allowed in check in bags this made us to be taken out while boarding as our bags were detected for power bank which had to be taken out and kept in hand bag If these cheap airlines can t manage then they should stop the service We found this ticket at the last moment when all other carrier became useless for us due to there heavy ticket costs and we had difficulties in getting a Taxi at exorbitant price to go to Shillong from there But these muggers pissed me off by putting too much extra charges on me for not seeing anything written about extra 15kg luggage on my ticket and also 400rs for every extra kg after 15kg When I called the customer representative to cancel one of my bookings they said we can t provide me full refund and cancellation fee is almost same as my flight cost Imagine if the followed the same rules for pro rate refund of flight ticket amount for delays caused and loss of prospective business at destination city I have used 3 budget carriers in India and this was the least value for money Having said this I would like the fellow passengers to realise that this is another cheap way of making money and exploiting the passengers The only pros is the cheap flight that you get if you are on a tight budget Only thing worth a mention in the hindsight is the considerable sound of the engine which was annoying after a while I informed them about this mistake the airline staff told me that my money will be refunded within 24 hours I ve been calling the customer service for the past 2 days with no sort of any response from your end finally I was able to connect with the customer service after 2 long daysSpiceJet is not really a low cost airline but he cant convince and he pressure me to pay extra money HORRIBLE HORRIBLE staff and airlines pls avoid at any cost them no concept of customer concerns for them They Cheated us while travelling from kolkata to portblair and asked extra money for the seats that we have already selected while booking After paying for my meal I am returning without having my drink is this the service you offer to your privilege guest extremely pathetic In a flight on no frill service what you expect is on time arrival and hassle free flight which was experienced very little leg room and very small seats compared to the other low cost carriers the aircraft was jerking almost through out the journeyPer ticket cost was INR 6K one way a bit more expensive due to peak season completely loss of my money This is not a matter of money but the way your people behaved with a guest I never had a delay and staff is generally nice considering that this is a low cost airline Due to this delay which perhaps was intentional many passengers were forced to go to the paid counter Hope they become little considerate to passengers and creat less inconvenience The idea behind this advertisement is to unconsciously influence people into purchasing the add on because the statement choose x is an attempt to subliminally influence people Smelly inconsiderate and disturbing Not even worth mentioning that crew didn t have blanket or Cotton balls The purpose of buying seats in row 1 was not served Being a low cost Carrier spicejet doesn t have aero bridge and they transfer passengers in Buses that are over crowded and stinky But she was too busy selling stuff and not concerned about passengers agony Not much can be expected from a flight with low cost ticket Ground staff was very politely telling me only thing possible is refund my money we flew from varanasi to jaipur with no hassle and on time flight When we go to airport the person who do check in do weight our baggage and tell me that you have to pay money for excess weight i explain i have 3 tickets and my weight is notThey sell you tickets with cheap fares and then have hidden feels for every step you take with the final fare coming much higher Cheap airline but the only flight available I prefer pre booking my meals since paying during flight seems very cumbersome pulling change etc Again no relief since drinks are not included with meals and you have to pull your wallet out The actual reason to reschedule the flight was due to runway closure for which notice was given to them way to early but still kept on selling flights with afternoon time to lure customers Specially recommended for short duration journeys because for long duration it is bit expensive cozIf they had to collect the money they should have done it while issuing the boarding pass Avoid Spicejet if you are travelling onwards internationally as you will end up loosing part of your budget I think they should learn from other low cost airlines in terms of customer services staff behavior and professionalism If I had elected to cancel our flight at this stage I would have received a reimbursement of approximately half the price of the tickets Only comment I received was that they will not return the money They take more than month to return your money and your money ends up being an interest free loan from the time of booking to the time of refund 6 the flight looks like an advertising commercial of metro or bus all the cabin is full of a commercial selling a brand Suggest to go with Airindia or other flights for Kashmir as Cheap flights like spice jet has its Impact sometimes Hey it s a budget airline priced accordingly The problem with SpiceJet is they try to extract money out of everything I then put the case forward that This money is not connected with the original booking still they don t listen ask for more money and finally they cancel the ticket They just try to find ways how can they snatch more and more money from customer by one or another way Spicejet are a cheap flights carrier without the frills and there are NO frills Please come along with the hard copy to save the money I would like to urge the airline to give the latest information on the website regarding baggage policies so that people don t have to go through the same hassle at the airport Its a cheap flightPremium seat selection priority boarding works out great but food and hence money gets wasted for kids If you are travelling with a lot of baggage be prepared to pay almost as much as your flight cost No one should be denied of this basic human function especially when you paid money for you flight seat which includes the right to use the washroom Despite paying for premium economy all that was on offer was ramen noodles In case I don t get back my money I will approach consumer forum Try spicejet if there is a discount or no other option is left and they simply wrote a generic mail and trying close this matter no courtesy to customer s loss of money and time The online check in is not very helpful as it generally shows many seats already occupied suggesting in a way to go for preferred seats with more leg room at extra cost They always want money forextra baggage and they dont understand the meaning of Being Flexible In flight food is good but really very less options Very uncomfortable experience when you are travelling with a kid and expect extra care from airline staff rather than additional trouble and focus on selling services otherwise dont bother buying food and i had paid so much money for booking they could you have suggested alternative options for me We do understand that cost is less for no or less services at the end of the day for everything there is money and allowing elderly woman with kids for quick checkin etc is all missingdidn t work do not use horrible service after paying money Just happens to be cheaper option hence select otherwise would go for other economy carriersTraveled with Family on 3rd Jan during thick fog season but flight was on time so no hassles 1st they convince to upgrade yourself by paying extra to Max upgrade in that even yr bags does not come on time As when it comes to looting money they are on the top but by the time it comes to deliver value for that money baby they are long gone no duty free purchase no additional luggage even check in baggage was 7 kg only This time we booked ticket for four of our family the cost was cheap flew to hyderabad non recline seats even though at the time of selling they book this for my younger daughter who is 15 yrs old but in flight at the time of check in they denied for max seat and ask me to call toll free for complaint so that is also not in good support in all my payments are wasted also in flight during entire flightI have paid upfront for food and the seat which costed me Rs 1798 I felt that the value for money was grossly inadequate Very pathetic service ground level staff are really worthless I recommend not to fly through spicejet at any costSpiceJet one of the cheapest airline in domestic travelers SpiceJet is cheap because they make their costs out of luggage cost extortion fees Initially it seems a decent price for the ticket then when you add up all the other costs of travel you feel slighted The rest of the staff also understood my problem and upgraded me with no additional costThis being one of the cheap cost effective airlines it was an average flight I was always willing to go a foreign country but didn t have enough money to book a flight I have traveled in December and in January and both the times my flight was rescheduled causing me much inconvenience The only alternative offered by SpiceJet was to buy further tickets and claim the extra cost back from my travel agent Being a low cost flight I cannot comment on the in flight services but the crew seemed cordial Ticketing online experience was hassle free Check in Did an over the counter check in cum baggage drop At Check in counter the lady said cabin baggage 7 kg including duty free purchases EXCLUDING Laptop bag They will neither give the cab train charges nor compensate the money for flight as GKP flight is costlier than delhi flight I also was shivering due to the air conditioning and had to take a quick decision and booked an alternate flight on Thai Airways for Rs 76000 for 3 persons since it was a last minute booking which was the cheapest direct flight showing at that time Costs over AED1 5k for a relatively short flight to Pune At the counter at Jaipur they didn t recognized our purchase even showing them the bill Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ï ½km by km basisï ½ rather than the price paid for each leg leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive The staff at the check in counter also make a serious attempt to sell the preferred seat at extra cost The que for the free counters were too long and they were taking unnecessary long time for each checkin Dont save money by booking this flight instead pay a little more and take some other flight It doesn t matter as the price of the ticket is less compared to other airlines This was cheapest flight on the date with good cabin crew and stop was at chennai for 3 hours but its totally smooth and comfortable process Cheap flights is the only main point to choose spice jet they even not serve any tea or coffee complimentary food offered was dam expensive It is a cheap quality product and charging huge amount from the customers For people concern with budget spicejet is an low cost option for them My advice on the above Double check your air tickets hereon when travelling by SpiceJet or any other low cost carrier so as to avoid unpleasant surprises Mr Ajay Singh cheap flight does not mean you can harass the travelers like this the gentleman offered me a premium seat with a cost of rs 600 to board the flight if the counter is closed how come premium seat is availble at a cost It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join but it doesn t matter They were not the cheapest flight that we could have used but we went with them after reading some good reviews In reality there is almost NIL difference between the fare pricing between LOW COST FULL COST airlines Only the flight time availability makes all the decisions SpiceJet is a low cost airline It is the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried its ok for economy class and rate also down compare to other airlines none of which I needed nor bought Morover they seem to have added my email which I used for the complaint to their mailing list and keep sending me lots of offers if you look carefully you are not always buying the cheapest ticket i believe u guys have much inefficient to understand This wont cost them much A low cost carrier with a la carte service Cheap Fares I was hassled at the counter for a boarding pass and they would not print it off even though I was running a bit late Inspite of our tickets being refundable with its deteriorating and no money issueWhen I do my tickets last moment but still not get a good deal as we pay roughly upto 16 17kBeware of the Trip insurance Offered Very less options available on this sector so have to opt for this flight again again Of course we know they don t serve anything Free of Cost in the flight except water But the cost of going back to city and the hotel for the night was of course not even a remote possibility As this Airlines extend Cheap Fare they are not providing any eatables Free of Cost inside the aircraft I am never again going to book with them and last yes they do have the cheaper price but not the correct strategy of pricing for running the business I had booked my my onward and return journey tickets SG 1027 708 during Apr 2017 for travel during Jun 2017 from Mangalore to Hyderabad to take advantage of pricing If you need leg room in this low cost airline flight of approximately 2hrs and 45 minutes duration select the Spicemax service at an additional cost Once it was my fav airlines but over the years the cost factor increased the service gone down site is not that user friendly This is one of the worst low cost carriers Terrible is an understatement sky high ticket prices opportunistic check in staff charged me for excess baggage at actual extra baggage worst seating arrangement in aircraft with no leg space for long legged passenger like me discourteous cabin crew worst flight ever taken by me No discount was offered on the Mumbay Patna leg and it took them 30 days to refund the return ticket Only go for SpiceJet if the ticket cost is too cheap when compared to other airlines or there is no alternate flight available on your route Since we were two of us there was no way we could web check in without paying extra But I do receive all the useless msg by this airline like upgrading your seat discounts or booking meals etc I rarely take Jet Airways because its costlier and none of the special choices of Spice or Indigo at affordable range Being a cheaper provider does not mean that good service cannot be expected One of the cheapest journey Booked one month before and got really good prices for the flight it was an early morning flight thankfully the ground staff started boarding early take off was a little shaky as the weather was not good got window seat luckily Agent Deepthi Don t know if this is her real name should better train how to speak to customers as you are making money on us and learn a better math for calculation and I was lucky to get a very cheap ticket 3 days before the departure date AMD BLR ticket costsTravelled pune to dubai return on spicejet good value for money only one thing that should be improved after landing in pune luggage service is very slow it almost took 35 minutes for luggage to come on the belt rest all ok as its tickets are very cheapSecondly when we had tried to web check in all window and aisle seats were shown as paid They get confused while serving in flight meals paid it wasn t a big deal in the end plus the privacy screen got a work out Food was awful and little choice virtually no leg room particularly when seat in front reclined stop off and transfer in Abu Dhabi is good but REALLY expensive if you do stop over After several back and forth emails they refused to refund my money They cost same as Emirates or Qatar and yet behaving like a stupid budget low cost airline This airline is only concerned with draining every bit of cash out of you I would say that they are the UAE equivalent of RyanAIr don t be surprised if you are asked for money for toiler paper when you get on board I have asked for this as money and they have refused More than two months now I am still waiting for the money and i have paid a stunningly ridiculous amount to allow leg roomSuch a disappointment paying all that money to have to ask for a drink not having any thing left for food This time though we had the opposite terrible and cheap food and the service is almost nonexistent Or in other words nobody cares and too bad you wasted time and money flying with us Been flying for more than 32 years and with almost all of the major airlines but this was one of the worst airlines in the world and must be avoided at all cost And Wasted My Money We will be taking this matter further as it canâ t possibly be legal to refuse a paying customer that purely relies on your duty of careyet I was made to feel extremely small for sitting in what I thought I had paid for Airline never refunded cancelled flight which was a significant amount of money after many emails and phone calls When we complained after the flight to Etihad head office the response was pathetic and they clearly didnâ t care which I guess says they are cutting costs on purpose but the cost was silly and the seats remained empty both ways which was such a waste If you want to buy an extremely expensive Business Class ticket and receive the worst service possible make sure to fly Etihad You should be embarrassed yourself for such a shambolic service and for stealing thousands of pounds from our hard earned money Stupid to think that going direct and cutting out the middleman would save money My aunt had to rely on getting physically carried by our family who travelled with her to help her transfer from point A to point B and at one point had to be left behind at their hotel in France and again in Prague as there were no options to neither provide nor rent out a wheelchair for her thus completely wasting her time and money stuck in a hotel room with nowhere to go Further evidence of Etihad s greed and lust for money from their customers with so many examples like this in recent years but that would have cost an awful lot of moneyAs if that wasn t bad enough Etihad s guest relation service even refused to credit us back the upcharge that I had paid Very expensive flight and extremely low value for money I was tempted to take up the email offer to bid for a first class seat for us as an extra surprise but this would have been even more of a let down waste of money and disaster for the start of our holiday when I insisted and of course was desperate with obvious stress about all these things as they were overbooked and itâ s their policy to give away confirmed seats to who pay extra money Really disappointed and we feel cheated as our holiday cost us a lot of money and the flying experience ruined it Only issue is that the prices do not follow so the value for money is pretty horrendous but they refuse to pay for additional hotel costs Watch with paying extra for neighbour seats or extra legroom Etihad will steal your money We prebooked seats on all the 4 flights we used and it was a waste of money on one leg of the journey i am unsure whether the plane wasnt a differnt configuation but seat 22a was one window which was to the rear and a bulk plane base that took up half my seat pitch the seat pitch is one of the worseGo ahead like this Etihad you want to be a five star airline but you behave like worse then most low budget airlines The 2nd plane from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok looked tired and was cramped again the food was the standard of a low budget airline Unless I read that Etihad do away with the underhanded advertising of cost and hidden seat expenses and if they change their menu and upgrade their standard of food I will not use this airline again A complete waste of money Being treated by their staff in such a poor way is unacceptable What s worse is the constant advertising of their buy on board menu which leaves customers confused and ultimately feeling ripped off And thatâ s why I am bringing this again to your attention to request total but reasonable compensation for the stress inconvenience waste of time and money and lastly humiliation the irreparable damage to her mobility scooter your airline has caused I was very angry with this flight as i knew to save moneyI can t say enough BAD things about this airline Why does Etihad think they are entitled to take money from customers but fail to deliver the service paid for Rubbish offer but for me its not a big deal If you have a problem to only thing this company does is taking the money out of your pocket It was real waste of our money and time please do r ever ever book this flight even if we get it for cheaper rate I mean come on how much worse treatment are u going to give You are plain thiefs stealing money from family pockets by promising what you shamefully are not delivering they took my money and then never gave me the empty seat This airline is the worst and most money hungry airline I have ever experienced Etihad Make money like everyone else and stop being a scam they froze my guest account while I was traveling I end up changing my flying dates and cancel my hotel and lose money because if this I try to call and solve it quick but it took them a week to solve the issue after the damage is done very disappointedPersonally when they lost my bags and they showed a poor way of follow upHowever returning from bangkok to abu dhabi they were just rude and said no unless pay 85usd when we enquired whether we could move to the empty row in front I explained I would be writing this bad review all over Social Media as this cost me to lose one holiday day Even the paid packages were ridiculously expensive Even for a seat in the front row or in the exit row with more leg room they now ask extra money The service was bad going and coning There have been major budget cuts but they could still do better than this This airline deserves to die and is losing money and they keep on charging on every silly thing they could make money from such as paid seat selection even within a span of 24 hours of flight Also babies should not be allowed in this section as they ruin the experience for all travellers who have paid a lot of money to travel this class with the expectation of sleeping having a bed is the clue if you canâ t sleep you might as well travel economy I d miss work and meetings getting myself in hot water and lose money I am truly dissapointed now with this airline I would avoid at all costs if I had another DIRECT option from Manchester It was like flying on Easy jet sleesy jet no food or drinks unless you wanted an expensive lousy debatable roll Furthermore saying that this is Etihad policy which actually just want to make extra money and rip off its customers With this my bag being 3 years old they are hardly giving any money back By far the worst option is Etihad presumably soon to be renamed EtiBAD or Etihadn tâ The movie selection is terrible no new releases a bad choice I lost 2400 and still trying to get my money back When we asked for our money to be refunded the airline agents refused Anyway after a lot of noise from Madrid Etihad refunded the extra cost for those seats Is airlines trying to steal the money from their customers when the customers are already going through a difficult situation with their flights cancelled due to this catastrophic situation in Kerala Bad choice However lately as Etihad is losing money from bad investments Alitalia Air Berlin standards are slipping I lost my passport and its going to take me a time time to get An exit permit without a passport I m at risk of losing the money please help before its too late I m also studentPathetic old aircrafts flying in and out of india and not even a patch on emirates truly disappointed by the food and service on board and was forced to carry my own food onboard on my way back as the size of meals was microscopic and inedible looks like they have no money left as they start selling food immediately after the first service to make an extra buck After we were charged ridiculous prices for things like two 100 gram chocolate blocks and a tiny two inch tube of hand creamI havenâ t even stepped foot on the airline and couldnâ t be less impressed with what is clearly an intentional policy aimed at duping people into paying for seats to sit next to their partner The Business Class product is world class and puts the likes of British Airways to shame for the same money I had a very bad experience with Etihad losing my full fare when my wife became ill just as we were taking out insurance which would not be accepted then The meals were really cheap looking very low quality the gift package is BS in Economy and has been reduced but I noticed an ad for Business first class and the apartment have a revised better gift pack suspect Economy paid for this They told us we need to wait for 4 days for another flight unless we wanted to buy expensive first class seats Quality is poor costs seem to be cut flights are not full and the once prestigious airline is now sadly a poor relation to the likes of Emirates and Quatar airways JFK is a typical lousy USA third world airport that nearly caused me to miss my flightIf you want to avoid hassles and be sure you deal with a professional company spend your money with any other airline is my advice as if you read reviews on them as i woshEven with Etihadâ s cost cutting they have introduced caviar service and now give F passengers 90 mb voucher for the WiFi I used to ignore the lack of efficiency while travelling Economy on etihad as even i used to opt for it as a money saver More as value of money I consider expensive for the services we got and fof seatsSo over people wanting more leg room without paying Absolutely not worth the money and would not recommend doing this As you already have my money why would you on a 14hr 40min flight understanding its evening hardly offer beverages etc I exchanged several emails and 2 long phone calls with OneTravel to tell Etihat to either offer me another return flight or pay my money back The ratio of staff per economy section is a little low Not only that they take money out of your credit card with NO notice So I am afraid if you want to throw away your hard earned cash travel Etihad as theyâ ll use it to pay for the economy flights They must be losing so much money to force such basic inflight standards and service and I have several expensive items missing from my Checked in Baggage Before it was a decent set of food now it is almost a HALF smaller main dish piece of bread on cheap foam plastic tray Since my last post about a week ago it turns out that Etihad cancelled and refunded money to the travel agent not because they weren t flying to BrisbaneNever the less they failed in that too as their prices are much higher I had booked an expensive economy seat for 1200 one way to bangalore Worst gift any of my children have received Deeply regretting not taking the more expensive Air France flight to Paris I was confused when I was flying with Etihad in economy class if the airfare I bought was for low cost airlines and you will get less leg room than in a low cost airlines because seats are so packed The food was mediocre to say the least with poor choice or no choice at times The inflight WiFi is just too expensive and not value for money I explained that I did not want to pay twice for the same seat as I don t have a lot of money anyway So I essentially had wasted my money on a seat I could have been allocated anyway Overall I have low expectations of long haul travel in economy It was certainly not value for money I would only fly again if I got a really cheap deal We have been trying to speak with Etihad just to cover the costs we lost for the flights backAvoid at all cost They charged me 250US best part is that 20kg is 70 and 30kg is 210 this airline is a scam avoid at all costs Avoid this airline at all costs there is a real attitude problem and far better choices out there Booked months in advance didn t want to pay very expensive seat pre booking costs Apparently Etihad are not travelling too well and need to save money Like all airlines Etihad airways had to save money since a couple of years due to wrong management of course the service on board was not improving When I tried to buy my excess baggage I did not get a discount because I supposedly missed my 48 hours Just money grabbing company Please do yours a favor use another carrier Their phone number is not working Avoid at all cost Not so good evidence of cost cutting Maybe their cheaper prices compared to their competitors justifies for this level of service In the end we have a bag that was brand new for this trip and has been written off by the approved airlines repairer in Cairns which report cost 15 because the bag was cut open in seams near lock It is a worth trying if you dont have a budget for flights I would NOT recommend unless you get a better deal or in dire need to go Biggest mistake spending your money for this airlines Extremely cheap shot by charging to reserve seats We received no form of apology when we complained just an email basically saying they had refunded our money Avoid at all costs Like all non budget airlines this one was just another economy class flightit seems to me that is a low cost company gestion who make money with luggages extra weight They informed us that our card had actually been charged the 5 times due to an error on there website and that they would refund us the money I never want to fly with them again and now have a non transferable voucher for their services that they think is compensation when really it just means more money spent on Etihad Iâ ve complained online and via the phone 4 times and have been offered a 100 dollar discount on the next flight The fact that I searched for cheap flights meant that I was trying to save money Not worth the money Abudhabi Airport is very disappointing especially when compared to Dubai with fewer selections of shops eateries and significantly higher prices American Airlines checked in thru the handbag to MAA on complimentary basis why is Etihad now trying to make some extra money preying on customers so even if we did fly Etihad again this would only cover little more than 5 of the cost which is laughable This flight was most definitely not worth the crazy amount of money paid Unfortunately I had forgotten that Etihad as part of a cost cutting exercise had removedâ Youâ ve already go my moneyand he is a regular Etihad flyer the entertainment system on the planes was also poor with not a big choiceThe second disappointment was by seeing the such low quality seats Need to amend a booking and get home early due to a family death no compassion whatsoever shown just money money money from them flight attendant was very rood and impolite with here response and said exactly that she has nothing to do with the cockroaches or the money I paid for my seat pls set down military orders The ticket prices were very expensive 6300 for the 2 of us this is more than twice the regular fare They seem to have taken cost cutting way too much and definitely sacrificing their service Not worth the money i received an email that my bid for neigbouring seats got accepted now the don t want to refund my money for the extra leg room seat I have been emailing them for 3 months now trying to recover some costs that i lost due to their own staffs negligence but they will not take responsibility even though everyone else we spoke with on our trip that worked for the airlinesDespite economy obviously being the cheapest ticket on this airline you are really made to feel like the lowest of the low the least important passengers on the aircraft Next time I ll spend the extra money on someone else It is bad enough that they charge for seats given that are apparently not a budget airline although you could argue this now but to deceive their paying customers into paying for seats they did not want to pay for and then refusing to refund the payment regardless of who was at fault is disgraceful I m not sure why Etihad with all its money and class cannot choose decent movies and TV programs to entertain its flyers on thoseâ they be have low cost for a high privÃ no choicee of seats no choice of meal seat distance in 777 too small no european rights of passengersConnection in Abu Dhabi to Paris flew in an A380 800 one of the quietest trip I ve ever done Crew cabin unpleasant cheap food butâ I asked the flight attendant and the guy setting next to me if he paid any money he said that He did not pay anything I found the food to be less than adequate and ended up purchasing extra food I bought it from Etihad Etihad chose to use a low fare inefficient airline like Nas it s Etihad responsibility to bear the costs of their mistakes no answer after that from the said customer service s Poor choices compared to Emirates Definitely will not be flying with this airline again all they care about is your money and not about the actual services they provide I understand charging more money for extra leg room seats but charging money for normal middle aisle window seat is play simple day light robbery The things I would recommend the company to correct poor low cost looking safety presentation with animated personages So just beware low initial prices for fares come with hefty seat allocation charges The cost to fly Business Class to Rome is quite expensive and our experience with Etihad is somewhat deflating a low standard economy class product and inconsistency throughout In effect this meant that the flight had passengers sitting next to each other some who had just purchased tickets maybe days before the flight with a 30 kg allowance and some who had paid months in advance they had the money all this time with only 23 kg and absolutely no consideration given to our request This added to very long waiting times on hold to speak with someone and their generally poor service nowadyas caused us to cancel at enormous personal expense No hassles to go out Since a while I feel now also Etihad has to cut cost Following the loss they recorded they went onto massive cost cutting which leads to deterioration of service I expect nothing for free but these costs are beyond belief and if you are going to rip people of could you at least be polite about it We had to opt for different meals not something you expect after paying for a business class flight What you notice that all extraâ s are taken away by most airlines to save on costs Its really sad to see a once such good airline surcumb to such budget cuts It is obvious Etihad does not care about customers and tries to squeeze you for whatever money they can get At every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff disgusting food poor service scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line It felt like its become a budget airline which would be fine if they charged budget airline ticket prices frankly the ticket price was too expensive compared to the service The hostess were not helpful and not smilingTheir mistake cost me 358 They have a widespread policy this spring summer of massively overbooking flights I saw around 50 people who d been put in the same position as me in the space of an hour and unlike other airlines do not routinely offer money or upgrades to incentivise passengers to switch their flight so that people who really need to get on the flight can get aboard They serve you beverage after one hour and no breakfast instead you are served lunch after 3 hours of flight time so that they can save money on food Frozen food was being served and water in cheap plastic bottles I would have been cheaper buying a business class seat so unless youâ re paying for First business class thatâ s to be expected When asked to explain the reason for the extra charge the reason given is that the 3 hand bags check in by American Airlines will NOW incur an extra baggage charge by weight and the total extra cost is 1640 Euros therefore we will be unable to offer additional compensation nor refund of your expenses honestly it was perfectly a disaster trip on etihad airline with a very high cost and disaster service Refund me my money and the interest amount too Not a big deal but kind of a bit unprofessional just merely a main course served on a tiny round tray a bun this is the worst meal I ever given by an airlines if I am paying low cost carrier airfare I would think is alright as is budget but is a no no for Etihad been the national carrier of UAE I would expect their inflight service will surpassed their rival Emirates but I am totally wrong in this aspect Lounge offerings only average but that s not a big deal The website said that I could get a 20 discount if I bought my excess baggage 48 hours before my FLIGHT Why oh why did we pay this money for nothing we wish we had not booked the seats and just turned up on the day The airline has gone from a premium airline to a budget feel airline Much hyped airline did not meet expectations it felt as if they were doing us a favour when we had paid for that flight I dont recived the money and asked for an update and get no feedback until now The oppurtunity to resell the ticket at an extortionate last minute price at Christmas to some other willing fool was obviously too much to pass up Only main course meal and a piece of cheap bread No mattress on bed apparently due to cost cutting A very unfortunate combination of normal airline and low cost business model if you buy the cheapest ticket online the seating is a problem especially if you travelling with your family you can be separated and the answer from checkin desk is sorry we cant helpI should have known that cheap flights will bring cheap service My TV system on the return leg didnt work but not a big deal Despite travelling as Platinum Members they never addressed us by name not a big deal but when my wife and I both asked for Salmon they told us they did not have enough on board It was not a big deal but its all about the services one airline provides to its customers and sometimes its necessity I forgot to pick my earplugs and thought that I should be provided with the plugs on board I have sinuses issue and really need to use plugs believe me as soon as I landed in London I ordered earplugs from Amazon There is no option to choose seats unless its paid and I still have not received any money Flight delayed and was only told once waiting in the gate area eventually when boarding our pre booked seats which had been paid for were discounted and our boarding cards torn up we were given no explanation and told we had been allocated new seats with better leg room at theâ Would rather suggest booking Jazeera or Air Arabia at least for the cost of their ticket they allow u to add baggage for a minimal sum The cost of changing a ticket with air India was more expensive than buying a brand new one with them and if already spent 6 hours arguing with air India Bid on the extra seat for a very low price turned out that aircraft full both waysNot really a value for money at all The price is high the service is poor especially the ground support check in was slow in the extreme did organised and people got very fustrated save your money and go with a cheaper airline or go with Emeriates Etihad simply are a waste of moneySpeaking to the couple next to me I found they had been allocated their seats automatically no extra money paid They have downgraded their service for business travellers and it now feels like it is a low cost option airline And this just because the sell more tickets than seats in the plane so when you arrive to the airport As the seats were selling out fast I didn t want to risk being separated from my partner for the whole tripwhen I select the same seats again it asks for money again I went to up grade my very expensive exit row seat to business class only to be told that the price of the economy ticket will not be taken off the price Cheap flights It is advisable to carry the no bags and buy clothes at the destination rather than paying these airlines for extra baggage and I do expect more hassles to deal with as I have seen many negative TA reviews recentlyI have now switched from other Airlines based on same service cheaper price I will be missing my train which I have bought the ticket months in advance to get it at a cheaper price and good spot if I don t flyout that day This came up as one of the cheapest flights to Manila Watch out once Ethad has your money you don tv get anything back We also have been given the seats with extra leg room next to the exit escape doors with no additional cost or issue Didn t like the idea of having to pay for your seat thought that was for cheap airlinesThe food and service on the flight was very basic and not of bad quality ansalways to loot money and no care about customersâ quite honestly I would rather starve than give them any more money Etihad Business Class just isnt worth the moneyand i must say this is the worse airline i have ever flown with including low cost Another irritation is the exorbitant amount they charge for either a free seat next to you or for extra legroom massively more than any other airlineI didn t know blankets were being treated like war rations for a flight I paid good money for I did not see any buy needless to say that I have not received money or email after that andInflight Entertainment with more than enough choices and WiFi worked without interruptions I checked and it would offer me a cheap cap for my trouble So I did throughout the whole purchase I was not made aware of any delivery charges so as far as I knew it was free But even after almost 4 months of communication via email facebook messenger we still haven t received the money from Etihad In the aircraft the blanket needs to be overhauled as it is low quality and its yarns spread over hair and clothes If a passenger has purchased a seat that needs to be locked The overall experience is very comparable to a low cost company The food was horrible the selection of movies is super bad etcWe paid a lot of money for this once in a lifetime trip and it was spoilt right from the start Etihad has been under fire for a number of years now for its cost cutting program after number of failed investments in airlines like Air Berlin and failures with Alitalia but now its cost me another Â 1700 for the same bookingYou can t book the onward leg seat without paying We were not given a menu but were just asked on the spot if we wanted a chioice of one of two very cheap meal options Sadly the latest news from Airbus is that they have suspended production of this gigantic engineering miracle due to high fuel and maintenance costs resulting in declining orders and leases not being extended with most airlines opting for the more nimble faster and less costly dreamliners so if anyone is still wanting to fly on one better hurry up and do so you may miss out if you wait too long and fly EMIRATES or ETIHAD ONLY â ºWith so many airlines competing for our money I don t think Etihad will be on the top of my list again I could have done this earlier with a lesser price but you did not reserve a paid for seat flying again soon but not with Etihadthe cheapest seats were approx Â 36 each so for 2 people that have 2 flights each way this works out to just under Â 300 on top of what youâ ve paid for flights already Main reason for choosing them is relatively short layout time in Abu Dhabi and a little less price from others We finally found our bags on our own and had to take a cab at our cost to the next terminal because at this point we were running late due to Etihad again In general you get what you pay for but they are cutting back drastically on everything and any way they can make more money they are doing but no big deal we asked them to swap seatsI felt the level of onboard service has dropped and feels like it is due cost saving With money you can buy the newest airplane and the best comfort but you cant buy quality service I noticed this time i could not check in without paying for a seat When your luggage gets lost on the way that s bad for your business and their business at Business Class prices Just one night before departure the agent told me airline canclled my paid ticket because flight is overbooked Etihad in its quest to reduce costs has made in flight experience a painful experience Etihad has become a LOW SERVICE HIGH COST airline with their 20 kg max bag allowance their horrendous poor meals their prohibitive extra weight policy for which they charge you 40 for EVERY extra Kg the extremely uncomfortable seats with reduced reclining capacity and the rudeness of the crew the most arrogant uneducated low class stewardesses in the market Only the headset was bad quality If anyone can please assist me with the process so that I can save the hassle of having to book another flight having to shell extra amount before the expiry of this voucher Our first time on Etihad as they were by far the cheapest Airline flying to Dublin I would not advice to use this airline as they give cheap tickets but try to huddle money out of you in different waysso it s their cheap idea to make extra money On the second leg we had no choice we were just given one cheap food option We also missed our flight from LA to Seattle on Feb 9th and I was only able to get a small portion of those tickets credited for future flights I could have seated myself next to my wife at a cost of circa Â 100 Â 600 I really feel that customers should be able to expect more for their money Flying business class did not give us much advantage Talking about being greedy Some drinks during the flight are now offered for extra cost You could have at least took some off my ticket price when you took my space I didn t like the additional cost to pre book a specific seat so that I was guaranteed to sit next to my partner After paying Â 4000 for our Business class seats I had a seat which was fabric on bare metal when I asked for help I was told I could adjust the seat firmness myself Ticket prices do not justify the service The flight attendant is slow and rude food is cold and no taste over priced tickets I will make sure not to use this airline in the futureFood onboard was acceptable however given that the flight cost was comparable with Emirates whom weâ ve flown with on a number of occasions the comfort leg room cabin crew and overall flight was nowhere near as good particularly on long haul They show lot of discrimination and Etihad should have at least given priority to women children and elder people but they were less cared and not bother to listen to the passenger s concernsThe food was almost entirely inedible What food they did give us in the ticket price which wasn t much I am so disappointed I have handed over good money for a service that they have just decided they can no longer affordAfter booking you will notice to get spammed by emails to upgrade seat select choose meals or other services all to high prices First of all I was not able to get a discount on my excess baggage because there was a misunderstanding So effectively due to an Etihad issue our flight was changed and we got terrible seats and we arrived over 10h later and Etihad is utterly uncontactable regarding this so that we can claim neither from Etihad nor from our separately purchased travel insurance about the flight delay When I told the stewardess I would not be able to sit in the seat due to another person literally sharing my seat she offered a move that would have cost me 150 please check the booking details and the fine prints carefully and have in your credit card enough funds to buy the ticket only so they don t block the same amount after ticket purchase and full deductionsOther than that decent airline and flights would use again at similar price What didn t help was the Ryanair tactic of separating my wife and I for the Abu Dhabi to Heathrow leg because we wouldn t stump up yet more money for booking seats shocking behaviour andIt feels that for the money its worth paying a little extra and fly Emirates so much more value for the same class I am a frequent flyer but over the past few years I have just opted for the cheapest flights available and usually it s a case ofFlying Lux AUD via Munich with first with 4h layover is absolutely not worth for paying first class After 14 hours in the Abu Dhabi airport we were on our way via another 12 hour unplanned layover in London Heathrow and we have decided to write this review as a warning to others so that they might avoid what we went through spending an extra 4 000 USD to get home and almost inconceivably inconvenienced in the bargain I was repeatedly told itâ s airline policy to overbook and if I donâ t buy the seats in advance I thought Online check in is only optional but itâ s a ruse to get more money a cheap way by airlines like Etihad the seats will be sold to who checks online and buy another staff told its first come first serve What about a confirmed ticket then who will honor that We had purchased all our seats however were not given the seats we had chosen after paying in full on booking the package in order to do so So depending on the seats you picked even the worst it could easily add â 60 to the ticket price as I had to pick seats for 4 flights so I quit the booking process When the customer pays the full price of the ticket they expect some good behavior from the crew ground staff and expect good services Never returned money for that Little things where u can see there is a big cost cutting happening at Etihad Therefore even being based in Abu Dhabi I will rather choose the stopover somewhere or take the ride to Dubai to possibly even get a cheaper ticket as well Further its again one of the cheapest options available between the cities and hence was the obvious choice nobody offered to try find me another seat or even cover it up better I paid over 300 for these particular seats but we discovered the first leg from Abu Dhabi to Madrid was not the seats I had paid for At only 5 hours I feel the additional cost of the business class seats is not warranted At the end they do not want to compensate more than a 300 USD voucher for Etihad tickets which doesn t even cover my additional cost I checked in this morning no order at checkin staff were completely unhelpful and unprofessional for business class and the price of a ticket for business class this level of service is completely unexceptionable I will choose another airline in future for my business trips Crew needs to serve each and every passenger in the same way because all of them are paid the money and booked economy class but crew only care about Europe passengers In any case to sort this out we even asked Etihad to transfer the funds to their Etihad office in Jakarta so we can collect from there and in reply to that Etihad said they can t send money to Jakarta office Their fares are 50 to a 100 pounds cheaper than the next priced airline for my route so I suffer their inadequacies It seems to me that Etihad in a bid to reduce operating costs have cut back on staff training and all forms of in flight entertainment Don t get me wrong they are still a decent airline price wise and efficiency wise but they aren t in the same league as their competitors and it seems to really annoy them at least that was the impression I got from watching all the adverts you get lumbered with before your film comes on They donâ t care about the passengers at all and just find unreasonable ways to make money I am disinclined to patronise their business class again if this is the level of comfort to be offered at non discounted market prices However some companies see these seats as â premiumâ and see it as a place to squeeze a little extra profit out of their customers despite the seats not actually being all thatWe were given two meals during our two flights each 6 hours aswell as snacks and drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic for no extra cost How can a company with other existing flights departing before then and partner airlines not be able to accommodate the paying customers earlier Cost of business ticket was nothing compared to similar airlines Which I got back after 3 days going through a lot of hassles At 24 hrs you can see the seat you ve been allocated but no real choice Well documented deep cost cutting on the off board experience such as cutting chauffeur services and secondâ My husband chose Etihad Airways because they were offering cheap tickets and moreover the flight was a little comfortable in a way that there were not so much passengers I am a loyal member of this airlines guest programme but must confess that I am considering exploring another UAE based carrier in the future as you do seem to get much more for your money and usually on cheaper airfares Don t have much choice for foodhave made purchased for seat selection but I have to change my flight schedule and paying extra enormous additional payment for this reschedule and they are not allowing me to carry the seat selection that I have purchased before instead they are asking for extra payment on new seat selection saying the payment made on the seat selection before cannot be carried forward neither refund Had tonpay extra to select seat a total of 1000 â after selecting the cheapest available seats Avoid at all costs as they were once excellent till they placed profits before passengers and most concerning is not 1 person who works for them likes the C E O or there own management that tells me a lot when there own staff admit to that along with ongoing mechanical issues in flight but do not tell passengers Note that the tickets for this entire journey were booked on Etihad Airways Website and Etihad now does not want to take responsibility for a flight ticket sold by them fancy buildings and expensive planes doesn t make a good airline it s about attitude and quality of service There were some hassles on the ground as the queue for boarding the bus was very long This did not leave us much option to settle our additional baggage and having to pay for same additionally not much choiceAs long as they have their additional money they don t care We were delayed by 3 hours in Singapore due to technical error no big dealChose this particular airline because it was the cheapest non budget option available but only by about 300 Not much variety highly spiced not a good thing when you are flying So for the extra money spent for business class for larger seats and lounge access I was put on a VERY economy bus that left 80 minutes after it was meant to without apology or explanation The food is reminiscent of the in flight food of the 70 s drinks served in very small amounts in cheap plastic cups This was made up of a 500 no show fee on my booked flight a 240 change of flight fee and a 598 additional ticket cost for the new flight So why have I given a 4 purely down to price difference you get what you pay for after all Dunno why I continue to fly with them I could have chosen a cheaper option Less and less opportunity to pre book seats free of charge at time of booking Everything is about money these days and not customer satisfaction pack them in should he the slogan Another thing was i had been allocated two seats free of cost before i decided to upgrade them so if they could not give me the seats i paid extra for why did they not put us back in the initial seats and refund the money as the service which was paid for could not be provided We had to fork out for a full fare again with no offer of a discounted flight given our predicament By the time I selected the cheapest seats for all 4 legs of my journey the cost was in excess of Qatar and Emirates We really feel that this was unfair treatment and as a result we will be giving No Consideration to flying with Etihad Airways again and we have advised our friends that the better alternative is Emirates and we will certainly give Emirates our money next time was limited and not too much option Eventually sorted out but what a poor show and all the passengers incurred additional cost and the answer from the staff was I cant help contact out Service center Unfortunately for us a family with a baby were behind us and the baby cried for most of the trip making it hard to enjoy the benefits of the extra cost attached to the upgraded ticket Have travelled a few times with this airline to and from Melbourne find the hostesses to be very accomodating planes are clean although a little old great value for money and the option to bid on extra seats if availableit s all about money thier customer service is the worst It gets better to save money there is no air bridge when you arrive in AbuDhabi their HOME BASE can you imagine a passenger travelling from Mumbai to Moscow only with her passport without any money documents or any cabin bag only because your illiterate staff member didnâ t know the baggage allowance policy If you consider an airline that did not even making it into the top 100 airlines of the world an eqal partner airline to you worth the same money I will treat you as such The booking does not auto reflect my miles and hassle for me to write in The seating was the same with the exception of more leg room im 5ft tall and dont need the leg room but was amazed that I couldnt sit there without paying With flights from Manchester to Bangkok sometimes costing as much as Â 500 return I could not resist this bargain round trip from Etihad at Â 361 You Cannot Sleep in Business Class even after paying Good Amount Seat are as you find in Economy Classbut it wasn t a bad choice airline needs to improve free wifi services I didn t like the food as well but my overall experience was good They always take a little extra care of the customers to ensure we have a good time and do not experience any hassles during the journey Finally had no option I agreed for paying another cabin luggage too Etihad had continually emailed during the week before our journey asking us to â bid to upgrade to first classâ which makes me wonder if they auction off the â nicer â confirmed booked seats to make more money This airlines services very standard especially onboard services except they have wifi onboard pay We were able to check in online with no problem and our seats were already placed together despite us not pre paying for this However the support system i e Air India app and website are difficult to maneuver simply don t work and seat selection consistently not honored or changed even when we paid extra to upgrade seats that money is lost I would avoid this airline at all cost the fact that no one has replied to me with even an appology just shows what kind of an airline this really is The airline seated all five of them separately none of them got the seat I had paid for in spite of having paid extra money Word of advise for anyone considering a cheap flight to India delay the trip and earn enough money to fly on a better airline like American Delta or United Good food selection has showers but no soap for some reasonâ also a spa section â not sure if paid or not This aircraft is only good for getting transported from point A to point B Not worth the money Guys seriously avoid at any cost Just wasted my money i showed the receipt and confirmation email also but they had taken money and issued the seat already to someone else It was a big waste of my money time and energy and the staff was not even apologetic That it has held tight to its signature trademark low quality and poor manners By withholding the refund they have effectively stolen our money We preferred the Air India route option as this was a non stop flight to an Indian city from Newark avoiding the hassle of transit in Europe or Middle East Though it is my tax money that is being used by the losses this horrendous airline is making I myself will never fly in this airline again Almost lost the money I wonder how long will it take to get my money back after ruining my Xmas trip On time departure on time arrival heard lots of bad things but we decided to fly with Air India I hope the government would sell off Air India and save some serious money for the taxpayers i was expecting very low quality stuff however from the food to entertainment as well as the toilets as they sometimes are bad in other airlines and the seat for economy was very comfortable it was amazing No wonder its losing money Avoid flying via Air India at all cost We spent a huge sum of money to fly business class to Delhi and were incredibly disappointed Air India is a waste of time and money please choose another air line when traveling in India Such pathetic service the customer care is rude these guys makes new rules each day greedy over money How I wish we could have taken the middle eastern planes instead with a layover for a cheaper price A simple issue like cheap quality toilet paper There was no issue with check in and boarding the staff behaved well and there was a serving of tea coffee with cakes biscuits and sweets all at free of cost which we missed badly during our return flight by Indigo Airlines Although I faced trouble in doing web check in I got boarding pass without any hassle at Surat airport never was i on hold LESS than an hour so 4 calls cost me a total of 4 hours So overall just a bad service with employees looking at you as if they were doing you a favour probably forgetting that I have to pay what for me is a big amount of money to travel with them Avoid them at all cost When I entered the flight a woman sat in the seat I had bought not quite keeping up with the low cost competition What a hassle we left with our own and taking the trolly full of luggage and headed for domestic section of the airport a long Q waiting for us Despite being in the Red for many years they have not cut corners on service and food to save money They said the flight is over sold the seat kept falling bothering the person behind me so they found me crappy tight seat in the emergency exit row in the back Problem with my second flight food was that Lunch items were more spicy and the snacks that they gave at the end was less and seems low budget Air India has great food the same identical uncomfortable seats and leg space as all other European or American Carriers but lower prices Big hassle now to dispute and reverse this theft Food was appalling and a far lower quality than the food supplied when flying in the opposite direction So I have decided to avoid AI at any cost Damn cheap price as compared to other airlines Value for money has absolutely gone down Avoid at all costs Pay more for business in another flight or pay less and you can better economy experience in other carriers With the headphones they provided you could not hear anything because they were of such bad quality I suspect it is a cost saving reason so I paid for specific seats for our return flight their site says if the seats are unavailable you get your money back Though the staff and the crew were very cordial and humble and pilot was highly skilled as the flight was very comfortable smooth without any turbulence but however there were very poor options for food and beverages very poor quality starters and snacks they had no stock of mineral water and they were refilling used plastic bottles no good choice for wines whiskey etc very disappointing and poor quality audio visuals and selection of movies poor quality toilet kits no good reading material except some Indian magazines Your air stewards are so boring and show their cheap looks when asked for something i avoided the airline at all cost My advise is there are some pretty good carriers in India from my experience avoid this one at all costs For something costing less than a quid this is shocking in my view Not value for money I seriously doubt that this aircraft has had any money spent on the passenger cabin since put into service air india did not refund for the lower cost ticket They did not refund the money either I had to fly with them once again this month since they are the only airline offering non stop service to Delhi I havenâ t been refunded the money I payed for the seat Dont buy their tickets at even 20 less price
