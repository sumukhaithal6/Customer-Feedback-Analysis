# Customer-Feedback-Analysis
Find the most critical issues of the company by analysing reviews on TripAdvisor
A Customer Feedback Model to analyze the customer review data of a company, and help identify critical issues based on their severity and impact on customers as well as management.
Customer review data for a company is collected, classified into categories (buckets). Aspect-based sentiment/emotion analysis is performed to filter out the negative-sentiment issues; Non-granular reviews (reviews that don't give specific/detailed issues) are removed using dependency parsing, and issues are ranked based on a severity score that is generated, to finally return the top-ranked issues.
